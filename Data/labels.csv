He learned to build from his father, and helped to build their own adobe home using material they had recycled from other adobe homes that they took apart. 



9:39  Rick remembers being sad about taking apart a beautiful old adobe barn. They would clean off the bricks, straighten the nails, and clean off the mortar from old adobe homes that the city was tearing down. 



21:00 Rick worked for a road crew for a while when he was young, but working with wood and adobe was always his passion. 



25:38  He remembers building a huge adobe kiva--like a church--for a Native American Pueblo. He laid 40,000 bricks with his son and pueblo residents. It was a great honor for him. 



38:08  He remembers watching his mother make tortillas for their large family. He compares tortilla-making to mixing adobe for bricks. 



39:04  Fewer people are building with adobe now. It makes him sad, angry, and terribly worried about deforestation. 



40:24  Rick talks about why it's important to teach, have apprentices, and carry on the art. Amy is his apprentice.

He came across the border from Mexico in his mother's belly.  His father crossed several times--first as a bracero and subsequently smuggled across on a train.  Roberto grew up in Martinez town.

05:53 At school, Roberto's teacher beat him for not speaking English.  He started bringing her flowers and then homemade tortillas and she passed him.  He learned to get through school this way and went through high school without knowing how to read or write.

09:16 Roberto's first date was to senior prom.  His date stood him up.  His sister sat with him that night and snuck a bottle of their father's tequila to get drunk on.

13:05 Roberto entered the seminary when his brothers (who were Mexican citizens) fought for the US in Vietnam.

18:55 Roberto left the priesthood and became a hairdresser.

26:26 Roberto went to school in Paris.  He would bring flowers to everyone in his class to become their friends but they interpreted it as being ""fresh. "" He stopped bringing the flowers but remained lonely.  During that time, he ate leftovers that the dishwasher at a restaurant saved for him and lived in a neighborhood of prostitutes.  One prostitute would greet him every day with ""vous le vous couche avec moi? "" He always told her he had no money.  Then on the last day, he used all the money he had not spent on flowers for classmates on a huge bouquet for her.  She made her offer once again but this time told him it would be free.  Roberto still refused.

34:00 After opening a salon of his own, Roberto met the younger Jackson brothers and was invited to their reunion concert in New York City.

36:10 While flying out of New York City on the morning of September 11th, Roberto and Linda were on the TWA flight that nearly collided with the second plane to hit the World Trade Center towers.

Cynthia and Maceo talk about being Latinos in the sciences.,"04:00 Cynthia is a native New Mexican and a hydrologist with the federal government.  She is one of very few Hispanic females in her position.  Maceo points out that Cynthia has many disciples and counts himself among them.

09:26 Maceo talks about growing up in an urban environment in San Francisco where his refuges were bookstores and parks.  

15:43 Cynthia got into the sciences in college because of a professor, Dr. Lorna Shields who encouraged her not just to become a scientist but to enter the then brand-new field of environmental science.

22:05 Joel grew up as the child of hippies.  His father drove the family out west in a converted greyhound bus and they settled in Albuquerque where his father became a county planner.  Joel learned about planning from his father and about moral values from his mother.

25:40 Maceo talks about the people and experiences that have influenced him as an ecologist from his grandfather to his family's long history of work in agriculture.  He talks about his framework for considering the world not in terms of ""resources ""but in terms of relationships where the earth is ""mother ""or ""father ""and the environment is ""me ""--even though these may not be scientific terms.

34:57 Anna Marie shares important lessons learned in life ""I can do anything I want . . . I can make it my way. ""

Devi is an undocumented student and Kevin is an ally who joined the movement recently.,"04:09 Devi first became aware of her immigration status when she wanted to take part in a middle school activity but couldn't because she didn't have a social security number.  

07:30 Kevin is a third-generation Mexican-American from a lineage of political activists.  He talks about the common misconceptions about undocumented immigrants: that they don't pay taxes and that their status can easily be changed from within the US.

13:50 Kevin and Devi talk about the obstacles that not having a US identification places in people's way.

19:20 Various jobs Devi has had to pay for school.

22:23 Devi is interested in working with children as an art therapist.

30:49 Devi agrees with the recent request that college counselors stop feeding students ""the bullshit that 'you can do anything' ""and instead give realistic, accurate and encouraging advice.

37:32 Kevin thinks that the movement is starting to win over opponents by exposing their lies and defying stereotypes about immigrants and Latinos.

He is currently in the City Council for Walla Walla. He had dropped out of school in 8th grade and became a migrant worker. He was later diagnosed with sleep apnea which doesn't allow him to get a good night's sleep. At 25 years old with a wife and 2 children he enrolled in Community College and then transferred to Whitman College and then attended Gonzaga law school.,"2:33 Conrado was a migrant worker. He only got to 8th grade before dropping out. At age 25 he already had a family of his own, but he went back to school and made it all the way to law school. There were a lot of challenges on the way. He was one of the only Hispanic in Whitman. He lived on a van outside of law school.

5:57 Law school did not provide him with any financial aid. He eventually told Financial Aid reps that a news station wanted to do a story on him and him living outside of school in his van. School gave him $3,500. This was enough for him to get an apartment.

10:03 Very difficult time after his brother's death (he died of a stroke at age 30). He didn't have enough money for books and somehow got by law school with out reading the textbooks. 2nd year of law school he moved family to Spokane

13:17 Everything Conrado has done including law school is dedicated to his father. His dad was a farm worker. Conrado remembers his dad asking him one day when he was going to Whitman what he was studying. Conrado said Sociology. His dad asked ""Se come?/ Can you eat from that. ""When Conrado made it to law school it made more sense to him since it was a vocation and was proud of Conrado. Knowing how much it meant to his dad kept Conrado from quitting.

16:10 Diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, an illness that prevent him from getting rem sleep and from getting enough oxygen.  Doctor asked him how he managed to doa anything in life with this illness including law school. CC wonders what else he could of done had he not suffered from Sleep Apnea.

18:18 On Walla Walla City Council and currently applying to be commissioner for Hispanic Affairs in WA.

They are research scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.,"1:38 EVS grew up in Tapanish, WA, the daughter of Latino farmworkers.  She remembers an 8th grade science teacher who first got her interested in science., and she's part of the reason EVS wanted to go into community service.

6:25 AH describes 2 workshops she did at Delta High School: LAFS (Learning About Food Science) and GLAM (Girls Learning About Manufacturing).  AVS conducted a 2-day workshop on materials science engineering--she developed experiments for students.

16:57 EVS says kids battle the conception that ""it's not cool to be smart. "" Another challenge is a generational tendency to recoil from things that are very difficult.

22:12 EVS remembers never really being exposed to science careers. She had very few people to give her advice about college.  AH grew up in Canada, and her parents both had post secondary educations, but she struggled through chemistry classes.  AH says it is personally rewarding to have to explain to students why she does the work she does.

32:08 EVS and AH talk about their conceptions of scientists as they were growing up, and how those conceptions have changed.  AH says she thought science was a mysterious black box, but ""now I realize it's a bunch of people working together to solve problems. ""

AH and EVS describe how they came to volunteer at Delta High School.  AH likes the variety it gives her work.
