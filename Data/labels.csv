22:30  Their father made their home out of adobe bricks. Her brothers helped build it. 



26:42  Sally shares a detailed memory of her family's trips to San Jos√©, where they would pick peaches and apricots. The men would pick the fruit, the younger men would move the boxes, the women would cut the fruit in half and set it on trays, and the farmer would count. The women would flirt with the young men so that they'd give them the boxes with bigger fruit because it meant more trays. 



32:26  She describes how the family would pick cotton. The men would pick, and Sally and her sisters would sell sandwiches and sodas. The women would pick, too, but the bags were so heavy that the men had to lift them for them. They helped happily. 



34:15  The family would set up camp outside beneath a big tree. Their mother would find a tree for the kitchen. She'd sweep the dirt until it swept clean. She would make tortillas and they would set up a table. ","Alvid, Sally ",StoryCorps facilitator,"Walters, Anna ",self,English,"Bosses

6:35  His aunt Nena took education very seriously. She promised not to get married until he went to college. Once he left to go to Yale, she finally married her longtime boyfriend. 



9:35  Yale was a big culture shock coming from poverty and the barrio. They food was different, and it was hard to get used to the was the waste of food. Later he worked with United Farm Workers and went to law school at UC Berkeley. 



13:00  Vito tells tells the story of an immigration raid that made him want to be a lawyer. He was picking tomatoes with his family when the migra came. Everyone ran. Vito remembers the sound of police batons hitting them. His uncle told him to  stay still. Because they didn't run, they weren't beaten. Vito remembers the fear, the injustice. 



16:08  He's now a federal public defender. He worked with California Legal Assistance, and focuses on migrant farm worker law, and the individual's rights. 

20:00  Maria grew up in Mexico City. She recalls Christmas and family times.



34:51  Vito talks more about justice. ""There is a role for law enforcement, but there is a human dignity that gets trampled on.



39:14  When asked how he wants to be remembered, Vito says, ""I don't know that I care to be remembered. If the things that I do while I walk this planet help improve life, then that's enough. ""

7:13  Tyra was raised Latina. She never knew anything about her father, or that he was white, until she was ten. When she found out, she was embarrassed to be white. He had never been good to her, his family hadn't been good to her, and she disliked them and that they were a part of her.

Dennis and Leona are happy to be able to serve others in this way.","Tiede, Leona Medina",husband,"Tiede, Dennis H.",wife,English,"Childcare

He learned to build from his father, and helped to build their own adobe home using material they had recycled from other adobe homes that they took apart. 



9:39  Rick remembers being sad about taking apart a beautiful old adobe barn. They would clean off the bricks, straighten the nails, and clean off the mortar from old adobe homes that the city was tearing down. 



21:00 Rick worked for a road crew for a while when he was young, but working with wood and adobe was always his passion. 



25:38  He remembers building a huge adobe kiva--like a church--for a Native American Pueblo. He laid 40,000 bricks with his son and pueblo residents. It was a great honor for him. 



38:08  He remembers watching his mother make tortillas for their large family. He compares tortilla-making to mixing adobe for bricks. 



39:04  Fewer people are building with adobe now. It makes him sad, angry, and terribly worried about deforestation. 



40:24  Rick talks about why it's important to teach, have apprentices, and carry on the art. Amy is his apprentice.

He came across the border from Mexico in his mother's belly.  His father crossed several times--first as a bracero and subsequently smuggled across on a train.  Roberto grew up in Martinez town.

05:53 At school, Roberto's teacher beat him for not speaking English.  He started bringing her flowers and then homemade tortillas and she passed him.  He learned to get through school this way and went through high school without knowing how to read or write.

09:16 Roberto's first date was to senior prom.  His date stood him up.  His sister sat with him that night and snuck a bottle of their father's tequila to get drunk on.

13:05 Roberto entered the seminary when his brothers (who were Mexican citizens) fought for the US in Vietnam.

18:55 Roberto left the priesthood and became a hairdresser.

26:26 Roberto went to school in Paris.  He would bring flowers to everyone in his class to become their friends but they interpreted it as being ""fresh. "" He stopped bringing the flowers but remained lonely.  During that time, he ate leftovers that the dishwasher at a restaurant saved for him and lived in a neighborhood of prostitutes.  One prostitute would greet him every day with ""vous le vous couche avec moi? "" He always told her he had no money.  Then on the last day, he used all the money he had not spent on flowers for classmates on a huge bouquet for her.  She made her offer once again but this time told him it would be free.  Roberto still refused.

34:00 After opening a salon of his own, Roberto met the younger Jackson brothers and was invited to their reunion concert in New York City.

36:10 While flying out of New York City on the morning of September 11th, Roberto and Linda were on the TWA flight that nearly collided with the second plane to hit the World Trade Center towers.  They describe the events of that day.","Vasquez, Roberto ",spouse,"Vasquez, Linda ",spouse,English,"Abuse

Cynthia and Maceo talk about being Latinos in the sciences.,"04:00 Cynthia is a native New Mexican and a hydrologist with the federal government.  She is one of very few Hispanic females in her position.  Maceo points out that Cynthia has many disciples and counts himself among them.

09:26 Maceo talks about growing up in an urban environment in San Francisco where his refuges were bookstores and parks.  

15:43 Cynthia got into the sciences in college because of a professor, Dr. Lorna Shields who encouraged her not just to become a scientist but to enter the then brand-new field of environmental science.

22:05 Joel grew up as the child of hippies.  His father drove the family out west in a converted greyhound bus and they settled in Albuquerque where his father became a county planner.  Joel learned about planning from his father and about moral values from his mother.

25:40 Maceo talks about the people and experiences that have influenced him as an ecologist from his grandfather to his family's long history of work in agriculture.  He talks about his framework for considering the world not in terms of ""resources ""but in terms of relationships where the earth is ""mother ""or ""father ""and the environment is ""me ""--even though these may not be scientific terms.  He mentions the idea prevalent in indigenous America of corn being a ""parent ""to humanity as one of the first cultivated crops.

36:20 Cynthia talks about her family background and ethics and the yearly gatherings of her extended family at their land and ranch in northern New Mexico.

41:30 Recruiting new scientists to take over the work.  The hope that we can be employed and not be killing ourselves at the same time.

"" This class got Jos√© thinking about college and despite the discouragement of his college counselor, Jos√© enrolled at Santa Monica College.

20:18 Jos√© recalls a class when he was asked to say something about himself and he blanked.  He looked down at all his name-brand clothes and realized he hadn't formed an identity of his own.  After this he stopped cutting his hair, found the Latin American Students Organization and started to realize he could tell his story.

29:58 Jos√© started organizing and participated in his first protest.  Before, the only raised voices he had heard were before a fight.

32:58 Erick talks briefly about his transition from writing about DREAM stuff to being an activist.

37:50 Erick wanted Jos√© to tell his story because his experience is underrepresented in the DREAM movement where most students haven't done the kind of odd jobs (selling hot dogs and shaved ice, washing cars) that he and Jos√© have done.

He is currently in the City Council for Walla Walla. He had dropped out of school in 8th grade and became a migrant worker. He was later diagnosed with sleep apnea which doesn't allow him to get a good night's sleep. At 25 years old with a wife and 2 children he enrolled in Community College and then transferred to Whitman College and then attended Gonzaga law school.,"2:33 Conrado was a migrant worker. He only got to 8th grade before dropping out. At age 25 he already had a family of his own, but he went back to school and made it all the way to law school. There were a lot of challenges on the way. He was one of the only Hispanic in Whitman. He lived on a van outside of law school.

5:57 Law school did not provide him with any financial aid. He eventually told Financial Aid reps that a news station wanted to do a story on him and him living outside of school in his van. School gave him $3,500. This was enough for him to get an apartment.

10:03 Very difficult time after his brother's death (he died of a stroke at age 30). He didn't have enough money for books and somehow got by law school with out reading the textbooks. 2nd year of law school he moved family to Spokane

13:17 Everything Conrado has done including law school is dedicated to his father. His dad was a farm worker. Conrado remembers his dad asking him one day when he was going to Whitman what he was studying. Conrado said Sociology. His dad asked ""Se come?/ Can you eat from that. ""When Conrado made it to law school it made more sense to him since it was a vocation and was proud of Conrado. Knowing how much it meant to his dad kept Conrado from quitting.

16:10 Diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, an illness that prevent him from getting rem sleep and from getting enough oxygen.  Doctor asked him how he managed to doa anything in life with this illness including law school. CC wonders what else he could of done had he not suffered from Sleep Apnea.

18:18 On Walla Walla City Council and currently applying to be commissioner for Hispanic Affairs in WA.

She remembers an 8th grade science teacher who first got her interested in science., and she's part of the reason EVS wanted to go into community service.

6:25 AH describes 2 workshops she did at Delta High School: LAFS (Learning About Food Science) and GLAM (Girls Learning About Manufacturing).  AVS conducted a 2-day workshop on materials science engineering--she developed experiments for students.

16:57 EVS says kids battle the conception that ""it's not cool to be smart. "" Another challenge is a generational tendency to recoil from things that are very difficult.

22:12 EVS remembers never really being exposed to science careers. She had very few people to give her advice about college.  AH grew up in Canada, and her parents both had post secondary educations, but she struggled through chemistry classes.  AH says it is personally rewarding to have to explain to students why she does the work she does.

32:08 EVS and AH talk about their conceptions of scientists as they were growing up, and how those conceptions have changed.  AH says she thought science was a mysterious black box, but ""now I realize it's a bunch of people working together to solve problems. ""

AH and EVS describe how they came to volunteer at Delta High School.  AH likes the variety it gives her work.

3:11 BH was picked on a lot--as a Chicana, she felt neither Mexican nor American.  In 8th grade she switched to a charter school, University High School.

7:50 BH discovered her own history in classes in college.  Her grandfather's first language was Spanish, but he didn't pass it down so as not to expose his children to the same prejudice he experienced.

18:31 BH started thinking about college in middle school.  The biggest challenge she faced was raising enough money.

34:25 BH talks about her mentors and what they mean to her.

8:13 Going to Truancy court was a wake-up call for each of them when they realized they had to make a change for the better so as not to keep disappointing older family members, and to inspire the younger ones.



10:07 They started cutting class, leave during lunch and just not come back, but for the most part they were scared that they would run into their parents or their teachers.



21:05 At their old school people made them feel uncomfortable, but at this school, friends make them look forward to class. Here they feel accepted.



28:52 The experience taught Isabel that Alyssa is a true friend on whom she can count, even though when they first met in 4th grade they disliked one another.

They feel the need to stay on the college and success tracks, but also want to live in the present, and don't want to be labeled.","2:44 NG has many attitudes toward his life--academic, social, and gangster, which is about defense, ""having your back against the wall. ""

11:27 MG looks up to his mother.  Once, she didn't let him go to the mall and he responded by threatening that he wouldn't go to school anymore.  She told him to do things for himself, and not for other people.

14:00 NG: ""Do you always know when you're falling off track? "" Their tracks are set for college and success, but LR feels that any bad thing or distraction will throw him off.

18:37 NG remembers a long drive home from Texas, when he told his mother not to think so highly of him, because he didn't want to deceive or disappoint her.

27:59 For a 6 month period, NG would record music with his aunty--during that time, he began to realize that he was labeled a gangbanger, but he really wasn't the stereotype.

30:43 Teachers tell NG and LR to go to college and study business or engineering to make money, but NG also sees his cousins earning money selling drugs.  NG doesn't feel passionate about business, but wants to do music or writing.  LR loves music and video production. ""When am I going to stop living in the future and not the present?
