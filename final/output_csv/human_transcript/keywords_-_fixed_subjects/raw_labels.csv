MBY005779,"LOUISA SANCHEZ: [00:00:00] My name is Luisa Sanchez. I am 68 years old. Today's date October the 2nd, 2009. Location is Colorado Springs, Colorado. Relation to partner, is my husband.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Hello. My name is Wilbert Sanchez, age 71. Today's date October 2nd, 2009. Location is Colorado Springs, Colorado. My partner is Louise.Interviewer: Tell me, where you two from?LOUISA SANCHEZ: From the southern part of Colorado, a little town called San Luis. It's the San Luis Valley by Alamosa.Interviewer: Is that where you've always lived?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yes.Interviewer: How did you two meet?LOUISA SANCHEZ: I was working at a clothing store in the little town of San Luis, and he happened to go in and buy some stuff and that's how we met.Interviewer: What year was this?LOUISA SANCHEZ: 1960.WILBERT SANCHEZ: 1960.LOUISA SANCHEZ: No, '62.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, we got married in '62.LOUISA SANCHEZ: We met in '60?WILBERT SANCHEZ: I think we met in '60.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Okay. He's better at the dates than I am.Interviewer: What were you doing in that shop? What were you looking for?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Kleenex.LOUISA SANCHEZ: (laughter) I remember that. He just went and bought a box of Kleenex, and I waited on him.Interviewer: How did the first conversation start?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, I remember exactly. He walked in and I say, ""How may I help you?"" Or something. He said, he wanted a box of Kleenex, and he paid me and left.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, actually, I didn't really needed that Kleenex. I knew she was in the store, that's the reason I went.Interviewer: How did you know she was, you had seen her before?WILBERT SANCHEZ: I had seen her before. Sure. Of course.Interviewer: How long before?WILBERT SANCHEZ: I don't know. Maybe a few months. That was just an excuse to go in the store.LOUISA SANCHEZ: It was on a Sunday afternoon. I remember that.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Right.LOUISA SANCHEZ: He asked me, ""Do you work every Sunday afternoon?"" (chuckles) I says, ""Yeah.""  Because he lived here in Colorado Springs at the time.WILBERT SANCHEZ: She was still living in San Luis, in her hometown, you see, and I was living here in Colorado Springs. So I used to go down there and visit my parents, and sisters, and brothers. That's the reason I asked her if she worked there on Sundays, because that's about the only time I go down there.Interviewer: And what did you first think when you -- Did you already have a plan to ask her out?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah, but I didn't ask her right away, but that was a start.Interviewer: So did you keep going to the store?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Oh, yeah.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Sure.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Every two weeks, he'd go down to visit his parents and he'd come, make sure he'd go buy some gum or something, and then start a conversation with me.Interviewer: Do you remember the conversation?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah. Like I said, he asked me, ""What days do you work?"" Just different things, starting a conversation. Just short ones. He didn't take too long. But then he kept coming around more often to visit his parents and go see me.Interviewer: What did you think about this guy who's coming to the store every two weeks?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, the first time, I didn't think much, because I didn't know him that good, and I said, he's just a customer. Then I don't know. He just started coming in and we started conversing more and more, and then he asked me out and I says, ""Okay."" So we went out. Then two weeks later -- he'd go every two weeks. And we started going out.WILBERT SANCHEZ: We used to go to the movies.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Go to movies. Yes, went to the movies. Go for a ride in the afternoon.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Went around town, yeah.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Go for a ride in the afternoons.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Small town, there's not much to do there.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah there's not much to do, it's just a small little town.WILBERT SANCHEZ: It's either you went to the movie or you just ride around.LOUISA SANCHEZ: We just ride back and forth.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Not much to do.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Take a ride and all that.Interviewer: How big was the town?WILBERT SANCHEZ: I'd have to say about 7,000 people, something like that. No, 700.LOUISA SANCHEZ: I think, say 1,000.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Probably somewhere in there, yeah. She lived in town and I was born and raised in a farm, which eight miles out of town.LOUISA SANCHEZ: [00:05:00] So he kept busy on the weekends. He'd go see me, go see his parents, and back and forth for the whole weekend.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Oh, yeah.Interviewer: What was it like growing up on that farm? Did your family always live there?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Oh yeah. My dad was there ever since he was young. It was a lot of fun. It was a small farm, but it was near the mountains. About 60 acres, but very, very nice farm. We had a stream going through there, fishing, and hunting, and we had all kinds of livestock: pigs, sheep, turkeys, chickens, everything. It was a lot of fun. It sure was. We still have it.Interviewer: Do you have any really great memories from there? Does one stick out like a good memory of working on the farm or spending --WILBERT SANCHEZ: Sure. Of course it was, yeah. I used to take care of the sheep, because we had about 20 heads of sheep and that was my job. People used to come and help us, because we used to raise a lot of vegetables. We used to hire some people and it was just a lot of fun working with my brother and sisters. Like I say in summertime, we had some other people came in and, yeah, I enjoyed it very much.Interviewer: How big was your family?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Two brothers and --LOUISA SANCHEZ: No, three.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, myself and two brothers, and three sisters.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Right.Interviewer: Were you all close in age?WILBERT SANCHEZ: No. Actually, we were all pretty much by six or seven years apart. We really were. When I was born, one of my sister was already married. Me and my two brothers were exactly seven years apart, and my sisters, and I don't remember exactly, but it was about the same, five, six years apart.Interviewer: Did your parents, were they the original owners of the farm?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yes, they were. My dad bought that place. Yes, they sure was.Interviewer: So it's been your family for a while now, right?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. I think must have bought it in the '30s.LOUISA SANCHEZ: 1920s, '30s?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Late '20s, yeah. Because he was there during the depression, yes.Interviewer: When they first bought it?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yes. Well, he must have bought it but 1925 or so because remember we tried to do some -- what do you call it?LOUISA SANCHEZ: When was your dad born? Remember, he was 18 years old and your mom was 16 years old when they got married.WILBERT SANCHEZ: That's right.LOUISA SANCHEZ: That's when they started.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. But they lived a few years in another place before they bought that place. I'm going to say 1925, somewhere around there.Interviewer: Did you ever hear stories -- How did they cope with the depression time?WILBERT SANCHEZ: My dad never really had a rough time, no. Actually, we used to grow our own everything. No. I remember him saying that people in the big cities suffered and jumping off buildings. But no, we never did. We had everything we needed, thank God. No problem.Interviewer: So there was always good stories coming out?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yes. Absolutely. We did great. I don't remember it, but I remember him talking about it.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, they raised their own vegetables, they had their own meat.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Cow's milk, everything. Sure.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Milk. Eggs.Interviewer: Does the farm still have all of that?WILBERT SANCHEZ: No. We still have it, but no. It's more -- Like I said, when I was there, we used to raise a lot of vegetables, cauliflower, sweet peas, stuff like that. Now it's more hay and alfalfa. Of course, my dad died several years ago and then my brother used it then. He used just to raise cattle and things like that. Now my brothers are gone, so now we have it leased.Interviewer: Where exactly is this farm?WILBERT SANCHEZ: It's in a little town of San Luis. The farm is eight miles east of San Luis. San Luis is the oldest town in Colorado.Interviewer: Where was that? Can you paint me a picture of what the town was like back then?LOUISA SANCHEZ: It's still the same. It hasn't grown.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, it's [00:10:00] quieter now. It's quieter now. I remember when I used to go on Sundays over there, it was busy running, just driving up and down the street because there was only one street. But now you don't see that many. A lot of business are closed now, really.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Also because, years back when we were growing up, we didn't have that much TV. In fact, there was no computers, there was no iPads, phones, cell phones. So people on a Sunday afternoon will just get in the cars and just go park downtown and talk to their neighbors, wave at their friends.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. Even the theater is gone now.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah. We still have one theater, but that's closed now because, again, everybody's got computers, they got their TVs, they got Comcast and all the modern stuff. When we were growing up, there wasn't such things.WILBERT SANCHEZ: There seems to be more people now.LOUISA SANCHEZ: But it's outsiders that are coming in, buying property.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. But for one reason or another,  you go to the little town and it looks quieter.LOUISA SANCHEZ: It looks the same to me when we go.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Because there's a lot of farms out there, a lot of villages. There seem to be more housing, but [inaudible] now you go Sunday afternoon to the town and it's dead. They're closing store where you used to work. That building is empty. Still just a couple of gas stations.LOUISA SANCHEZ: That's it. And also because, when we were growing up, people didn't have so many cars or automobiles.WILBERT SANCHEZ: I guess that's it. Yeah.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Now, everybody goes to the next town, Alamosa, where there's Walmart and there's Safeway. It's about 45 miles?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Alamosa is 45 miles to the west of San Luis. I think you're right. Back then people didn't have many cars, and if they had cars, they weren't too good. Now everybody has cars. I think they like to go to a bigger city.LOUISA SANCHEZ: And the biggest city is Alamosa.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Right.LOUISA SANCHEZ: So the little town of San Luis has turned down as far as clothing store and grocery stores and all that stuff. Then they built Walmart in Alamosa so everybody goes to Walmart.WILBERT SANCHEZ: That's it.Interviewer: What was your childhood like? Did you grow up on a farm as well?LOUISA SANCHEZ: No. I grew in the little town of San Luis. I grew up with my grandmother. We used to walk to school, which I tell my kids now, ""We used to walk to school."" ""Yeah, mom. Right.""Interviewer: Was it far?LOUISA SANCHEZ: No.Interviewer: Two, three blocks.LOUISA SANCHEZ: No, about four blocks, maybe five blocks. We used to walk home for lunch because we didn't have a cafeteria, we didn't have lunch rooms. We used to walk. We used to go in the morning, come home at noon to eat. They give us an hour. Walk back, and then just hang around with our friends.WILBERT SANCHEZ: You were lucky. See, I had to go a mile.LOUISA SANCHEZ: You had to go on your bike.WILBERT SANCHEZ: To grade school. I had to ride my bike and it was very, very cold. Well, that's one thing we haven't mentioned about San Luis, that it's very cold.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Very cold.WILBERT SANCHEZ: It's very cold. Minus 20, minus 30, wasn't unusual, and lot of snow.LOUISA SANCHEZ: In fact, last night it was going to get to 10.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Ten degrees in Alamosa.LOUISA SANCHEZ: In Alamosa.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. So I had to ride my bike and half of the time I used to get off and just walk because riding the bike made it too cold, the wind. Then after grade school, then I used to ride the bus to high school because it was eight miles away. You just had to walk for four blocks again.Interviewer: How young were you when you started riding your bike to school?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, I think just when I could ride the bike, probably by at least second grade I was riding the bike.Interviewer: Were there paved roads back then or what was it? Can you tell me? How was it?LOUISA SANCHEZ: The only paved road is the main downtown, right? The main street.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah, the main downtown.LOUISA SANCHEZ: From east of the main road, when I was growing up, there were dirt roads. We didn't have no paved.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. Going through our farm from San Luis was all dirt roads.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Dirt roads.WILBERT SANCHEZ: That road through San Luis, if you keep going South, will take you to Taos, New Mexico.LOUISA SANCHEZ: It's only 15 miles from the border, from state line, New Mexico.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. We were 18 miles from the border of New Mexico.LOUISA SANCHEZ: The state line.WILBERT SANCHEZ: But going east to our place in the [00:15:00] farm, it was all dirt road. In fact, I remember, because there was a small church about a mile from our place, that's where we used to go to church. During Holy Week, we used to leave the pickup by the main road because we couldn't go to our house. Because, if we did, we knew we couldn't get out. So we left it there in the main road. My dad said because if we go in we'll never get out unless we put chains on. So several times we did that. But the wintertime, I remember having to put chains several times just to get to the main road to come to town.Interviewer: Was it really cold when you'd go to church? Because there wasn't heat there or anything.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yes. I remember, for Christmas Eve, oh man, we had a 1941 Chevy, a car. I don't know, I don't remember too good, but that thing had a gas heater. I don't know what they meant by gas heater. But once you're driving it, it was about 20 below zero, and it was just barely starting to get a warm by when we get to church. My brother would try and clean the windshield. It had even ice inside. You had just a little bitty hole so you could see. Because, my dad and my mom, she had all kinds of blankets for us kids and that's how we made it to midnight mass.Interviewer: So let's go back to when you guys started dating. I'm really curious, do you remember your first date?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah, I remember. He asked me to just go for a ride downtown. We went back and forth downtown.Interviewer: What kind of car did he have?WILBERT SANCHEZ: 1960 Ford Starliner.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Okay.WILBERT SANCHEZ: It was a black with red interior. I remember that car.LOUISA SANCHEZ: I had never seen -- what do you call them?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Windshield washers?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Windshield washers. So I got in the car with him. All of a sudden he put in the windshield washers that sprayed the water. I said, ""Wow."" I had never -- ""This guy is -- wow!"" I still remember that because I had never seen -- Well, I didn't even have a car. I didn't even know how to drive. So he put on those windshields, I said, ""Wow. This guy's got something here. He's got windshield wipers.""WILBERT SANCHEZ: I turned them on because I needed to clean the windshield, not to impress you. (laughter)LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, he did impress me. I still remember that.Interviewer: Did you propose when you got married?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Oh yeah.Interviewer: How did that happen?LOUISA SANCHEZ: We had been dating for about eight months?WILBERT SANCHEZ: About that.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Six months, yeah.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah.LOUISA SANCHEZ: He just went one weekend again, like he did, his usual weekend, every two weeks. He asked me to get married. He told me, ""But I don't want an answer now. I want you to think about it. Don't give me an answer yet,"" right?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Right.LOUISA SANCHEZ: ""You think about it. I'll be back in two weeks."" It was a two-week -- We only saw each other once every two weeks.Interviewer: For how long?LOUISA SANCHEZ: For about eight months. Because he lived here in Springs and I was over there. I didn't have a phone.WILBERT SANCHEZ: No.LOUISA SANCHEZ: So we wrote each other letters back and forth. Again, he asked me to marry him and he told me not to give him an answer right away. I'll be back in two weeks.WILBERT SANCHEZ: I didn't want to pressure you, see?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah.Interviewer: How many times did you say that?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Just that once.Interviewer: Just that once?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Just that one.LOUISA SANCHEZ: I knew already.WILBERT SANCHEZ: I had my answer by next weekend.LOUISA SANCHEZ: I already knew since he asked me. I knew he was it. So I waited. He came back in two weeks and I gave him my answer.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Was it two weeks? I thought it was one week.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Was it a week?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Whatever. One week. Two weeks.LOUISA SANCHEZ: But since the day he asked me, I knew what I wanted. Then from there on, we got married.Interviewer: What was the wedding like?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Beautiful.WILBERT SANCHEZ: It was a nice wedding.LOUISA SANCHEZ: We got married at nine o'clock in the morning, it was a mass. Now they've changed so much. But at that time, you would get married during the mass, a regular Sunday mass. The priest would announce about two or three months before that there was going to be a marriage during the mass. During the mass, we get married and then they give us our mass, [00:20:00] and then the reception after, and then dancing.WILBERT SANCHEZ: We had the same priest, right? At least I did, for my baptism.LOUISA SANCHEZ: First communion.WILBERT SANCHEZ: First communion.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Confirmation, and married us.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Married us. The same priest.LOUISA SANCHEZ: That priest was there for over 30-some years. He knew each and every one of us. He baptized us, first communion, all the works, all the way to marriage. But he passed away about five, 10 years after we got married. Then he passed. He was getting old. He got involved in a car wreck, right?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah, in a car wreck. That's right. He's buried in the church grounds.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Because he was there for so long.Interviewer: What's his name?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Father Onofre MartorellWILBERT SANCHEZ: Right. From Spain, right?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah.Interviewer: So did you live in San Luis?LOUISA SANCHEZ: No. When we were dating, he was already working here. He would go down there to see his parents and see me. So we got married over there.WILBERT SANCHEZ: We came here right the same day in the evening.LOUISA SANCHEZ: After the whole reception, the whole thing.Interviewer: You came here?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yes.Interviewer: To where?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Colorado Springs, Colorado.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Colorado Springs.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Because the priest worked at the Air Force Academy.WILBERT SANCHEZ: We were going to go to New Mexico for our honeymoon. That was what the plans were.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Right.WILBERT SANCHEZ: But my dad talked me out of it.Interviewer: Why?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, you know, back then they were --LOUISA SANCHEZ: They didn't believe in those things, get married and settle down.WILBERT SANCHEZ: He says, ""Son, what you gonna to do out there, just spend money? Why don't you just go home and get things fixed up or whatever you need. That's a better way to spend your time and money than going somewhere else and spend your money, that's it."" So I said, ""Okay."" so we changed our mind.LOUISA SANCHEZ: At that time, there was a lot of respect for our parents. We listened to them and we took a lot of their advice, and it was fine. We didn't go on a honeymoon, but we're still together. We take a lot of trips now. So it's fine.Interviewer: So have you made up for the honeymoon?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. Sure.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yeah. We've been all over.Interviewer: Where are some of the most memorable places you've been to?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Well, we didn't took long trips 'til our kids were able to.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yes, because we took the kids.WILBERT SANCHEZ: But then we went all over, took them to Disneyland. We went to Las Vegas about three, four times. We went to Yellowstone, Carlsbad Caverns, we went to El Paso, Mexico. Where else? White Sands, New Mexico.Interviewer: How many kids do you have with you? How big is your family?LOUISA SANCHEZ: We have three children, one is deceased, we lost my son about three years ago. We have our two daughters and one of my daughters gave us a beautiful little grand baby. She's 14 months old. Her name is Emma Rose.Interviewer: Is that your first grandchild?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yes.WILBERT SANCHEZ: One of our daughters is still single. She still lives at home.Interviewer: What do you hope for them in the future?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, the one daughter that's married, my wish is, and I hope and I pray, that her marriage lasts as long as ours, and forever. So far, it's going great. My other daughter is still single. Same thing, I wish her that some day, she'll get married, have a beautiful life, and start raising her own children, and have our history, going back. Be proud of who they are, where they come from, our roots.WILBERT SANCHEZ: They have good education. One of them is an electrical engineer and the other one is an accountant.LOUISA SANCHEZ: For Hewlett-Packard.WILBERT SANCHEZ: They both work for Hewlett-Packard. So they're doing very well.LOUISA SANCHEZ: All of our three children, they went to elementary school, high school, college. They never gave us any problems. No drugs, no drinking, no nothing. They were good, honest kids, hardworking kids. [00:25:00] We are very, very proud of them. And Wilbert and I, we always work together with the kids. If there's problems or something, we discuss it. We don't argue about it, we discuss it and come with a conclusion. He has his idea, I have mine, we put them together and it works out. To me, being married to him has been beautiful, has been wonderful, I don't see no obstacles, no problems. Like I say, we've been married for 47? Wilbert?WILBERT SANCHEZ: 47. Yeah.47 years. So far so good. Like I said a while ago, we've become one. We're not two different people, we're becoming one.WILBERT SANCHEZ: I might have felt the same thing. Like my dad used to say, ""A house without a wife is like a farm with animals. No sheep.""LOUISA SANCHEZ: He used to love his sheep, so that's what he used to say, ""A house without a woman is like a farm without sheep.""WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. He was right.Interviewer: Do you see yourselves in Colorado for the rest of your life?LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yes.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Sure. Absolutely. Yeah.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Because we were born and raised here, our parents were born and raised here in Colorado.Interviewer: Is there one thing you just love about Colorado?LOUISA SANCHEZ: The four seasons: winter, summer, spring and fall. The mountains.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah, I was just telling her coming over here how pretty the trees are, the different colors. I love the fall for the colors of the trees, and the spring for the flowers.LOUISA SANCHEZ: The mountains. We love the mountains. It's all we know.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Pikes Peak looks beautiful with snow on it.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Because even the valley where we're from, it's a valley, we're surrounded by mountains all around us. So we love the mountains, the seasons, the weather. We've had beautiful summer.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Yeah. A lot of people didn't like the rain, but we love it. Yeah?Interviewer: What do you hope for the future for the both of you? Where do you see yourselves in the next 10 years, taking more trips?WILBERT SANCHEZ: Sure. Absolutely.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Well, our health. Number one is our health, that's priority. As long as we have our health, we can do whatever God lets us do. God is number one.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Absolutely. Yeah.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Our health and God. Then we can do whatever we want, take trips, sit down and watch TV in the basement. Now we've got a little granddaughter, spoil her, then send her home to her parents.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Watch the Broncos.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Watch the Broncos. Whether they win or lose, but we watch the Broncos.Interviewer: Well, thank you so much for this. We have about a minute left. Is there anything else you want to talk about?WILBERT SANCHEZ: No. I enjoyed it. I thank you for allowing us to do this and we thank Deacon Ernie to invite us to do this.LOUISA SANCHEZ: At first, we were a little questioning because we didn't know of what we were doing here. So it was fine. It was great.WILBERT SANCHEZ: Thank you for helping us.LOUISA SANCHEZ: Yes. You explained very, very well. You did a good job.Interviewer: Thank you.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
MBY005843,"Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	[00:00:00] My name is Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka. I go by Cyd. I am 52 years old. Today's date is October 14th, 2009. We're in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and I'm interviewing my mother.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My name is Dominica Capelli Anschutz. My age is 86. I was born on the Fourth of July of 1923. Today's date is October 14th, 2009. We are in Colorado Springs, Colorado. My partner is my daughter, Cynthia Stenicka.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	You are a beautiful woman. Eighty-six years young.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	A lovely woman in my life. You are an amazing story.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	It is a pleasure to interview you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	So I want to start a little bit with your heritage. Can you tell us a little bit about your father and your mother?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My father is Joesephi Capelli, born on Lake Como, Italy, in 1880. He came to United States in 1904 when he was 24 years old. My mother was Prudencia Martinez, born in San Mateo, New Mexico of Spanish parents. What else?Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	They married when?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	They married in 19... 1921 is when they married and they had -- well, my mother had been married before and that's another story.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Go ahead. You can tell that.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, she was married at 15 the first time and had two little girls and a baby on the way. When she was 19 years old, her first husband passed away during the flu epidemic. My father came into her life, then later on because he needed somebody to do the laundry. It was her mother-in-law that was taking in washing in order to provide money for that little family that had been left without a father. They were married in 1921, and then they had five other children, which I am the middle of that group. So my mother had eight children altogether. My father took in the mother, and his wife, and the three little children, and the mother-in-law because she had nowhere else to go. We knew her as our grandmother. She died when I was seven years old. That was the story of my mother's side of the family.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Your mother died fairly young.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My mother died in 1966. She was 65 years old. My father died in 1973 at 93.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	But your mother was young when she passed away?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes. My mother was young.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	What took her life?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Diabetes, more than anything. My father, just his heart stopped beating, just like that.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	What was your relationship with your father?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I loved my father. He was my one and only person to go to for anything. My mother and I, she did not really understand me very much, and would want to keep me and I wasn't one to be kept quiet. I had to get out and do things. She had not much of an education. My father, there was no college education or anything but he learned because he traveled so much. He went from Italy to France, learned to speak French, and then he went back to Italy to serve his time in the military, and then went to Argentina where he learned to speak Spanish. Since my mother didn't know any other language that came in handy because my mother never learned English. I didn't learn English until I went to the first grade in school.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	When you were seven, something nothing happened to you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	When I was seven, yes, we were in the pickup and I was riding in the back of the pickup, and my uncle was in the front with my dad. Anyway, we were crossing the railroad track and there was another train in front of him and another train coming on the other side that hit us. So it turned me around completely and I ended up right there looking at the wheels of the train going.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	So you are thrown from the back of the pickup and almost killed?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes, I could have been killed. I could have ran right into the train. [00:05:00] But the Lord was good for me then and He's been good ever since.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	You were industrious in school and you started working young. Let's talk a little bit about your early working days, and why you went to work, and what you did?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, I wanted to be active and this was in high school by then. I wanted to be active in everything that went on in school, but my mother would say, ""Yes, you may do it, but remember there's no money."" So I said, ""Well, if I go to work, can I do these things that I want to do?"" She says, ""Yes, if you go to work and you have the money, do it."" So I went to work, I got up at four o'clock in the morning and went to a bakery and wrapped bread until seven o'clock when the trucks would come to pick up the breads. Then I went home and changed clothes and went to school, then I came back and I sold tickets at the theater at night. We only had one movie theater. I just went there and worked, and then ended up with my first business. My first business was the concession at the theater. I was working there anyway. I had my sister come in and helped me during the time that I was busy selling the tickets. But that was my very first business since I was 19 years old, maybe 18 only then. Or no, even before that, because I graduated when I was 18.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Let's back up one step and talk about your freshman year.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My freshman year. I was very popular in school, and I got to be the homecoming queen as a freshman in school. But remember that it was a very small school and they didn't have much of a choice, I mean, if they had to choose whatever was there.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I think they picked very well. Let's move ahead a little bit to your days in the carrot business.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, when I was 19, I had graduated from high school, and I had learned bookkeeping, thank goodness, in high school. I was hired by this carrot growing company, a produce company out of Salinas, California, that grew 600 acres of carrots in New Mexico. I was hired as a payroll clerk because in those days we did not have banks. We hired a lot of Indian people, out of the Pueblos or the Navajos, mostly the Navajos. They didn't even know how to speak English a lot of times. So we would pay them in cash everyday.  So at four o'clock every day, I would come with $10,000 in my little satchel in cash to the commissary which was eight miles from town, and I had to pay everybody. I learned to speak enough Navajo that could count the money to them. I could say, ""Hello, how are you? How's your mother?"" that sort of thing. I've forgotten everything I knew in that respect, but it was wonderful at that time. I'm going with $10,000 in cash every day at four o'clock. and everybody knew it. There comes Minnie, there comes Minnie. I never worried about it. I wouldn't go if somebody knew who had $200 today, I wouldn't do it. But in those days, it was okay. The Navajos, I learned to love them all dearly. They were all good. Later on, I worked for the State of New Mexico, later on in the Income Tax Division. I had a lot of returns that would come in Minnie Begay, Minnie Panera, Minnie Blue-Eyes, or Minnie somebody. I know all those babies were named after me.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	It could very well be. So you were in the carrot business and a dashing young man came to town.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes. I had worked for three years in the carrot business and my husband had just come after -- well, he was out of the military then but this was 1946. He came with a friend of his to open a clothing store for men in Grants where I was born, where I grew up. So we had our first date in June and we were married in November of that year and then he was hired by the same company that I'd been working for. So we worked together then for seven more years.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	What was his name?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Oh, his name was Cy Anschutz. He was known as Cy Anschutz. His real name was Leland Kent Anschutz. He became Cy Leland because there was a football player in his day that was named Cy Leland. So everybody started calling him Cy Leland [00:10:00] and pretty soon the Leland dropped out and he was just Cy from then on. We were married for 56 years, he passed away in 2003. I had four -- two children.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Seemed like four sometimes, didn't it?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Two children. Our son that lives in Denver, and my daughter Cyd that lives in Colorado Springs. I have three grandchildren and one great-grand and they're all wonderful. I have had no problems with any of my children at all, it is a blessing.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	That's on public record, folks.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	A blessing.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Let's talk about the depression. How did that go for you personally?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yeah. Well, I was seven years old when we moved. Well, my father had moved to New Mexico to build a castle for this sheep rancher that was very, very wealthy. He was building this big castle, which is now just a big house but in those days, I guess it was considered a castle. So he became a very good friend of that man who was very kind to all of us. During the depression, that man provided a place for us to live so that we could have a farm, I mean a garden, and we had fruit trees and we could have a cow or two for milk or whatever we might need as we were growing up. We never felt that we needed anything, we were well provided for. We lived in this big house, all the boys were in one room and the girls were in another room and so on. The walls were three feet wide and in that one room, which was our dining room, there was a window seat. So we sat on that to do our homework or to study or to pray or whatever we were doing. Anyway, we moved away from that house. We lived in it for eight years and after that, we moved away and somebody else that moved in, wanted that window to be a door. So they cut out the bench that I'd been sitting on and under there found $27,000 in gold coins, which would have been a lot of money in those days but it didn't belong to us and we weren't living in that house anymore so it went to the owner of the house. But they didn't even know how the money got there, I just remembered it. We had no banks and nobody knew about banking or anything else. So when they had any money, they would hide it somewhere so that Bonnie and Clyde wouldn't come and get some.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Very good. What happened at Christmas time in that little community when you were living there?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, we lived at the end of town, at the farther end of town. We'd start out singing carols and as we walked down, the people that lived beyond us would join us and we'd end up with a luminaria, a great big luminaria where we were supposed to end up for food or whatever. So it was a marvelous time for us and I never knew that there was any problems when I was growing up because we didn't see any of them. My mother and dad probably did, but we didn't.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	You have often talked about the fact that your home was a home full of love.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Oh, yes. Always, yeah.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	That your dad was very loving to you and you've always been close to your family.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Oh, yes.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I want to thank you for providing for us a home filled with love as well.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	It were. I just loved everybody. I mean, it's just my nature, I guess.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I have a question for you. You have been the glue for many groups of people whether it was dad's family, your family, your colleagues at work, people that you know now at church or wherever in the neighborhood, how do you do that? What is it that you could share with whoever might be listening about how to be that person that everyone knows and everyone can come to in the midst of sometimes a lot of conflict?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I'm just me and I didn't work at it. It just happened to be that way for me and I was just always glad to do it and happy to do it and wanting to help anybody that needed me for whatever. Starting out with my own family and then my husband's family was another real challenge you might say, but we made it. Everything was going well.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	They love you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	They all love me even though I have no one. I'm the only one left in my family and we have one member left in my husband's family. [00:15:00] But all the nieces and nephews all call me or they come by or they take me places or they just love me like I was their grandmother, I guess.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	When you and dad moved to Colorado Springs in 1995, after being in New Mexico for all those years, what happened in that neighborhood?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, there again, we would sit out on the front porch for a little bit and before we knew it, we knew all the neighbors, everybody's name, and how you doing, whatever. Then several people said that until we moved there, that they didn't know their neighbors even. So it was just the friendliness, I guess, that we were given by the Lord that got us all together.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	So let's talk about your spiritual walk. Let's go back to the early days when you lost a sibling or two along the way. What was that like?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, I was born a Catholic. I mean, my father was an altar boy in Italy and when he came, he was the one that saw to it that we went to church. I always felt that my mother was a Catholic but in name only because she never did participate in anything but my father was the one that would take us and bring us, whatever we needed to do. Yes, I lost one little -- the only boy in my dad's side of the family died at seven days of age. He was just a baby and he was just the baby after me. I mean, he was born after me. Then, later on, we had another little baby that was born at -- that died at birth. That now was Celestina, whom we called Sally. So there was that loss. Having been brought up Catholic, it's very difficult to change. They do tell you that once a Catholic, you're a Catholic for seven years, you're a Catholic for life. Well, in a lot of ways, maybe that is true, but in a lot of ways you can change and I have changed. It's been a wonderful thing for me. This church that we belong to now, I joined the church because I felt that this was mine to do whatever. So it's just been a most wonderful thing, there's so much that it gives. There's something for children, there's something for teenagers, whatever on up the line. Now, I belong to the Prime Timers group, which I'm in charge of providing a place for us to go eat every Sunday. Then I go to Naomi's which is for the widows and that has been a wonderful thing too. As long as -- as far as... and I went to Sunday school, Vacation Bible School with Nick.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Who is Nick?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Nick is is my daughter's son, my grandson, and he was five years old --Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	That's my boy.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	When we moved here, he was five years old and he wanted to go to Vacation Bible School, but he didn't want to go alone. His mom was working and his dad was working, so I said, ""How about if grandma goes?"" Well, that was great. So I started going to Vacation Bible School with my grandson and I went for 12 years and I learned a lot from this church because I didn't know. I mean, we had the Bible in our home but we never read it. My husband read it I guess. He was the one that was the Protestant and I didn't know. I mean, we never read the Bible in the Catholic religion. We had our prayer books and our rosaries and that sort of thing. You must do right, good or you might not make it to heaven I mean. So what else do I need to say?Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Let's talk about the lessons that you've learned through your life.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I've learned to be even more kind than I've ever been to other people, to cope with a lot of things that may be problems that you don't know exist, but you do the best you can with them, and try to make it right in one way or another. I guess that's what I've learned, and I always got along with everyone. My in-laws, I loved them dearly, all of them, and people that I worked with, and my one man that I considered my second father was the fellow that had the produce company out of Salinas, California. I learned more from that family, from him than I would have learned going to college. [00:20:00] He was just wonderful, and I ended up being the office manager for that. Out of being just a payroll clerk, I ended up being the office manager, and I did all the accounting and everything. We had big buyers that would come from New York, and one of them came up and says, ""Oh, so this is Minnie?"" Yeah, she sure sounds a lot bigger over the telephone.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Because you were a tiny, petite thing.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yeah. I only weighed 83 pounds when I got married, so I was very tiny, but I was not afraid of anything. Never have been afraid to try anything, or do whatever needed to be done. I guess that's where it comes from, I don't know.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Tell us about your life now. What are you doing now? Where do you live?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My darling daughter and her husband built a cute little house for me in their backyard. Sometimes they let me off the leash, but not often. But it has been the most wonderful, wonderful thing for me because they're right there close to me, and I go with them, or I come, or whatever. I have the most wonderful son-in-law that anybody would ever want. He just does everything. All I need to say is, ""I need such and such,"" or ""I want to do such and such,"" and it's done, or it's there immediately almost.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I would say that that's not for everyone. A lot of people tell us as we do our life together with you living in our backyard that, ""I wish I could do that for my mom,"" or ""I should do that for my dad or whatever."" But it's not for everyone, and yet for us, it has been a great blessing, and we're grateful that you're there, and that you are the way you are, and we just love having you there.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, thank you. Thank you so much. It might not have worked with my husband being there because he was also opinionated.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Well, you never know. The way it worked out is that --Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	We would hope, wouldn't we?Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	-- we were able to do it, and I'm glad to do so. But I admire you so much for, again, continuing to be the one that people called that you are very dependable, you are practical. I have another couple of questions that are maybe a little bit more than just the factual things. If you could talk to mothers out there, what would you say about being a mother?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	It's the most wonderful experience that I've ever experienced. Really it's just the most wonderful thing. I always wanted children.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	How many did you want?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I wanted six, I wanted 12, and I wanted them all to be boys until I had my first one. Then when I got out of the labor room that first time, I said, ""I don't want any more kids, no more kids."" But anyway, Cyd came along after that.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Thank for reconsidering.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	She came along after that, and we lived in Grants, which was 80 miles from the hospital. I had gone for checked up, and I said to the doctor, ""Can't we just have this baby now? I don't want to have to worry about having to get here in a hurry or something.""Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	When you were pregnant with me, you're saying?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I was pregnant with you. Yeah. You were due on the 15th of August, and you came on the ninth. She keeps telling me now that I took her out of the oven too early, so that's what's the matter with her.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Because you said, ""Let's just do this now.""Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yeah.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	""I'm ready, and I've got my son covered.""Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Let's just do it and get it over with. I just was ready.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Well, that's okay.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	You came a few days early, but not very many days.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	If this were to be -- if you were to have had 12 boys, or let's say you want to say something to your son, what would you say to Mark?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I would say that I am so happy to have him. He was my first and only boy, and I have loved him unconditionally in anything, in every way. I love him to this day. I love everything. I call him every Sunday, and if I don't call him, he calls me. We have a wonderful relationship there, as well as with you, and I get along with his wife also as well. I'm the mother-in-law in that department, but we get along just beautifully. She's a sweet little lady and I love her dearly.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	You have three grandchildren.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I have three grandchildren.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	One of them was your housemate for a while.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes. I wonder who that was. Nick was my house mate for awhile, and when moved into this little house, they built a basement, which ended up being Nick's place to be.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Because he got to help build your house, which was really a neat experience.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes, he did.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	He said, ""How many kids get to build their grandmother's house?""Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes. I know.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Usually it's [00:25:00] the other way around. Grandpa built this house for us, so that was very special for him.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yeah. It has been very special for all of us.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	If you wanted to say something to Nick, what would it be?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I would say that I just love him dearly, and I don't know how else to express it that I just love him with every bone in my body.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Sheena and Dennis?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Sheena and Dennis also. Dennis, my oldest grandson is 36 now, and he has a son who is my great grandson, and he is 14 now. We have a wonderful relationship with all of them. I do. I am so blessed, I could not be happier in my old age if that's where I am. I don't feel old. But when I look in the mirror, I don't see me, I see my mother. I could not be happier. I am so blessed. Wonderful friends, people from the church all have just, I don't know, they just become my family as well.  I'm grateful, very, very grateful.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Very good. If this were to be our last conversation, what would you want to say to me?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I would want to say that I would thank you very much for being the daughter that you have been, and the daughter that you will continue to be until the day I die. I love you, love you, love you with all my heart, and I am grateful that the Lord gave you to me.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I love you too.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Let's talk a bit about the things that you would have done if things had been different. Was there something that you wished you could have done or something you still would like to do that, I mean, I know we got you off the back of the snorkel boat in to the ocean, and then that was a big deal to get you into some deep water, not being a swimmer, but is there anything that you would still like to do? You're a very capable, brilliant, fun-loving woman.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I just take it a step at a time, and if anybody says, ""Come on, let's go."" I'm ready to do whatever, as long as I'm healthy and able to put one foot in front of the other, I'm going to keep on doing it. I do regret that I never went to Italy to see where my father was born. That's the one thing that I think of that I should have done and didn't, but I always wanted to go with him. By that time, the Depression came in to be, and all these other things, and marriage, and children, and so on. It was just not something that I could do, but that's the only one. I have wonderful friends in Costa Rica.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Talk about Costa Rica a little bit. You've had lots of experiences there, we all have.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	My husband went to work in Costa Rica before he went to the military. He was there, and he met a wonderful family, and they became good friends. In fact, they had been good friends for 64 years by the time that my husband died. We had that connection. We'd go over there, and they'd come over here, and we visit back and forth. one of their sons came to go to college here and lived with us a lot. He was just like my kids' big brother because he was 12 years older, I think, than Mark.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	What did he like for you to make for him?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, anything. Tacos was one of the favorite things. I say now, I am not -- we're not in Costa Rica, and you're not going to get breakfast in bed. You'll have to get up, and get your own breakfast. There will always be food in the refrigerator whether I'm here or not, and when I'd come home sometimes, I'd find him with a seven tiered sandwich. ""Well, this look good and that look good,"" so I just added on, and on, and on. He was a wonderful son. He came when he was 22 years old to live with us to finish his college because his dad insisted on it. When we went to meet him at the airport, he says, ""Hi mommy,"" and he was 6'4"", great big guy, but I loved him dearly also. We had that wonderful connection, and we have gone back and forth to Costa Rica a lot. In fact, we talked to him just not long ago, and they're doing well. He's got two children, two boys, and two of my other boys. It's been a wonderful relationship. This boy's father was my husband's best friend over there, so we had that connection with him. He was coming to celebrate his eightieth --Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Ninetieth.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	90th birthday, yes, 90th birthday on the 20th of February, and my husband passed away on the 13th. They never got [00:30:00] here, but they were in New Orleans already, and he said, ""Maybe it's a good thing we didn't get to Colorado. We're tropical [inaudible 00:30:08] and it would have been too cold for us."" But they were just wonderful friends always.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Who has been -- can you name a best friend?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Who is my best friend? You are.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Well, thank you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	You are my best friend. You really are.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Wow. Thank you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Because I can talk to you about anything.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Yeah. I can talk to you about anything, and I appreciate your friendship. I think you're my best friend too.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Isn't that nice that we've figured that out today?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	It is good, yeah. Thank you.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Is there any other advice that you would give? Any thoughts that you would have for people that are in their eighties and passing on a legacy? What do we need to preserve from your generation?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	The love that we've had for the family, I think is the most important. Your love of the Lord is another one that we must keep going. Just love everybody that -- there's no way that you can't love people if you sense a love in return, but you have to give it first. So I would say love everyone with your whole heart and try to do for them, or even if it's just a kind word or whatever. It doesn't have to be any monetary thing or expense of any kind. Just to be there when they need you. To cry with them, or to laugh with them or whatever, which is what I would do.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Your generation in particular with the World War II vets has been called the greatest generation, and we are losing a lot of those men who fought in World War II. As a wife of a man who served in the military for a period of time, even though dad was not a career military man, there is something about that bonding with those men. Do you have any thoughts on that or perspective on that?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, they were in it because they wanted to be in it. They weren't forced to be in it a lot. Like my husband came from Costa Rica where he was having a wonderful life there because he needed to serve in the military.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	He wanted to, he chose to do that.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	He chose to do it because he could have had deferment or whatever, but he wanted to come and serve his country. He went into the Army Air Corps, which was the one that preceded the Air Force. He loved those people and they had such a bond with each other that went on until the day they died. All his friends were still very close to him and very good by correspondence if not by sight. But we kept in touch with everybody and he loved that era. He talked about it a lot and enjoyed what he did, happy to do it. He was an instructor. He was 22 years old when he went in, so he was older than some of the 18-year-olds that were going into the service then and so he was... I've lost my thread.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Just talking about him in his service.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, anyway he was the instructor for that month and then he never went to the European theater, but he said he went -- they asked him, ""what did you do"" and he says, ""Well, I went to the ETO."" What was that? European Theater of Officers, I guess.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Operations.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Operations, and he says, I went to East Texas and Oklahoma, ETO.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	But he trained bomber pilots.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	That was a pretty neat chapter for him.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	He loved it. He loved being in that part of it.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	So let's talk about, as opposed to those coming behind you and the legacy that you might want to leave with them. Let's talk about those that are in your same stage of life. We are around senior citizens a lot, you and I because we love them.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	We honor them and want to do well for them and learn their stories. So what encouragement could you give to those who are toward the end of their life, presumably if they're in their eighties? Because you have such a zest for life, what would you tell your colleagues who may be struggling?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, I'll just say regardless of what stage of life they're in, health-wise mostly, just stay active [00:35:00] as much as possible. Maybe not able to walk anymore, but your mind, keep it going. Keep an open mind to what goes on around you and love each other, and be there for each other, to protect each other as best we know how. To me, that friendship is such that, I have several in my group that are just like my sisters, and even better than my sisters in a lot of ways. Because being a good friend sometimes requires a lot more than a sister can do. But I have loved them all and I would just say that keep one foot in front of the other and keep going. Do not sit back and wait for death because we might outlive her.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	That would be neat. Well, I think you'll probably outlive me and that would be fine with me. You can take care of me when I'm old.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, like they say, when I grow up I want to be an old lady, an old woman, I guess that's the thing on television now and it's okay. Get up there, it's not bad.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	It's a state of mind.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	It is a state of mind. I don't feel old until I just look at me, or when I can't get up out of the chair or something, I feel a little bit old then.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	What do you do to stay active?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, I go to the Y twice a week for exercises, and then for the Silver Sneakers program. Then I do yoga twice a week when my daughter teaches yoga. I don't go to her class there, but we do have a class at our home in Nick's basement, and that's once a week. So I go four times a week to do some kind of exercise.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	How about your brain activity?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, I keep busy. I do all my book work, I do my own income taxes, and I do Sudoku all the time and I enjoy it very, very much. If I don't have something to do in my hands, I'll go to sleep watching television or something. But if I have that little gadget to work with, or I like to do crafts stuff, I crochet a lot and I knit. In my days, I don't knit now but I used to do a lot more of that sort. I make cards for everybody and in fact, I've made 160 of them just now to take to the women's retreat.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Thank you for that. One last question. Do you want to go to lunch sometime soon and continue this conversation?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I'm ready, did you say go? I'm ready.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Thank you so much for spending the time to just tell us about yourself and your life.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I'm happy to be a part of it.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Thank you for being my mother, and for all the love and joy that you've given me and my family.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Thank you. Thank you so much for those kind words. I really appreciate it too.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	I love you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	I love you very much.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	God bless you.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Namaste.FEMALE_1:	Do you mind if I ask a couple of questions? First of all, you said you didn't speak English until you went to school, is that right?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	Were you speaking in Spanish?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Spanish.FEMALE_1:	Was that a difficult transition?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Well, it didn't seem so at the time. No, it didn't seem to be difficult at the time because everybody was in the same boat. I mean, they call that class of primary class like past-start, what is it?Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Headstart?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Headstart is today in order for us to learn enough English that we could start in the first grade. Then we never were allowed to speak Spanish in school anywhere during recess. Once you went to school, you spoke English only and that's what made us learn to speak it.FEMALE_1:	Did you have friends that were in the same boat that you weren't allowed to speaking Spanish?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Probably maybe so. I don't know. Once we got there, though we all were speaking English, probably there were some that were in the same boat. I don't know. Who would they be? They all spoke Spanish, so they probably came from the same situation.FEMALE_1:	Then did you continue speaking English at home with your siblings?Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	Yes. We spoke. In fact, my mother learned a few things in English when we'd be talking to each other, the siblings, and we would be talking about let's go, let's go, let's go, and my mother would say no go, no go. Then the other thing that she learned in English is, shut the door. So that was the extent of her English. But my dad, bless his heart, had learned French and Spanish and now was learning English. I would help him with English as we were growing up. He would help us with homework and whatever. But it was just very difficult for him to write anything in English because he didn't know. He made the grocery list and I can remember [00:40:00] pan would be for bread, which was Spanish, and he'd write it all down. But then when he was doing a bid, he was a building contractor. So when he was bidding on that, he would say, so many dors, D-O-R, dors, Vindos, V-I-N-D-O, and that's a way that he learned. Then I would do it a little bit better for him in the English that I knew as I was growing up. So I helped him from the time that I could read.Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	Tell us about the bill, for dad that time. How he wrote it, how Nono wrote it.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	He could not say -- my husband's name was Cy Anschutz and he could not say that very well. So he'd say, ""Minnie Capelli's husband.""Cynthia Lee Anschutz Stenicka:	It's in the bill too.Dominica Capelli Anschutz:	So he was working on fixing up a cabin for us up in the mountains and then they said, ""How do you want this bill, Joe?"" He says, ""Oh just say Minnie Capelli's husband."" That's the way the bill would come all the time, Minnie Capelli's husband. Bless his heart, but he did pretty well. He raised all of us and he was a wonderful, wonderful father. I never will forget him, ever.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
MBY005844,"Denise Ricks: [00:00:00] Okay. I'm Denise Ricks. I'm 29. Today is October 14th, 2009 and we're in Colorado Springs and I am here with my dad, Dennis.Dennis Gonzalez: Dennis Gonzalez. I'm 56 years old, it is October 14th, 2009, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Here with my eldest daughter, Denise.Denise Ricks: Okay. So I guess we're going to talk about what your ethnic background is.Dennis Gonzalez: My background; I consider myself Mexican American. My dad's family was from Mexico. My mom's family was here from Colorado, but I'm not so sure what she was an American Indian. Her background is not clear if she was American. I know she was never Spanish-speaking. She only spoke Spanish later through the years with my dad and his mom. His mom spoke primarily Spanish. But as I grew up, probably through age 14, I was always probably considered Mexican by the white people who I grew up with to all the Anglos I grew up with, I was a Mexican, though I had no idea because I didn't speak Spanish. As I got a little older, maybe 14 years old, through maybe when I was 19, we had what they called the Chicano movement. We were following guys like Corky Gonzales and [inaudible 00:01:41] in the East Side of Pueblo, and we called ourself Chicanos because that's what we tried to identify ourselves with at that time. Later on through life, I guess, the US government changed what we were from Mexican Americans to Latin Americans to Chicanos, to I think we're called Hispanics today. No, I think the word is now Latino. What is it? It's Latino or Hispanic Americans.Denise Ricks: Latino, I think.Dennis Gonzalez: Right. That's the mostly part of my background.Denise Ricks: Was your dad originally from Mexico? Did they immigrate here?Dennis Gonzalez: No. My dad was born here in Pueblo, and he was born in what they call the barrio of Salt Creek, and his dad was from Mexico. No, his dad was originally born in Mexico, came to this country to work the fields out there in the Arkansas River Valley from Salt Creek all the way out to probably Avondale. My dad, as young a man, worked in the fields with him. My dad later in life went to the military and served in the Army during World War II, spent time in India, I guess it would be India, that area, that theater, as an auto mechanic. When he came back to Pueblo, he continued to be an auto mechanic, got a job at the Pueblo chemical depot as a mechanic, and worked for 30 years out there as a mechanic supervisor. He also had his own garage in town, but he was born an American and served in the military as an American, yeah.Denise Ricks: Do you remember any stories that your family used to tell you when you were younger?Dennis Gonzalez: I remember a lot of stories that we'd go through at that time. The stories that I remember telling our family as we were young kids, we used to hear stories of La Llorona, of the lady who had murdered her kids along the river. In the night, people would see her walk in the river, crying, and the word Llorona is the crying lady. We always heard that story. It was a frightening story, especially when we heard it, and they'd tell us stories in those days to make sure we weren't too far from the house. Don't go by the river, you might see La Llorona. My mom and dad and my uncle and aunts were out, and they were partying, having a good time and they decide to leave us at this lady's house. I'm not sure if this lady was my cousin's aunt, I'm not sure who she was, but we all stayed there. In them days, families were eight kids, seven kids. So there must have been probably 21 kids running around, and our parents, they left us with this lady and she must have been, I would guess, probably 65 maybe. In those days, a 65-year-old woman [00:05:00] looked like an old lady, they dressed in black, and they were widows so they dressed like a widow. We were all running around, it got to be dark, and we were running around the neighborhood. There was a ditch running behind the back of her house, the Bessemer ditch. So we were going and she'd call us, ""Come closer. Come on."" Talked to us in Spanish. ""Ven pa'ca."" We wouldn't listen. So all of a sudden, she went and got this, what I'd call a shawl, put it over her head and got into her front porch, and started rocking it and crying, wailing. As we started hearing that, the thing that came to our mind was La Llorona. I bet within five minutes, kids, and I had teenage brothers probably at the time, we were all sitting in the porch and today we still laugh about it. That lady, she knew exactly what she was doing. What she was doing was getting us all to sit on the front porch. I'll tell you what, we never went back to that house again.Denise Ricks: Then you grew up your whole life in Pueblo?Dennis Gonzalez: I did. I grew up on the lower east side of Pueblo. It's got a bad reputation today, but in those days, it was a neighborhood of Hispanics, Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Caucasians, Anglo people, and Italians. There was a lot of Italian Americans and Italian immigrants at that time who had come to Pueblo to work the CFNI and the coal mines. So it was a pretty good neighborhood. There weren't real nice houses in part of them neighborhoods at real lower east side. The roads are still dirt roads. The street I was born on, in fact, I was born in the house that I lived for 18 years, I wasn't born in a hospital, was paved. It was part of a highway. It was part of Highway 96 that ran through Pueblo, and I grew up in that neighborhood. Born there and I grew up with my brothers. I had two brothers, five sisters, and a two-bedroom house. So you know what that was like. I slept on the floor. I still believe I slept on the floor half my life, in a corner. It wasn't bad. Everybody did it in those days. The neighborhood was a pretty nice neighborhood. At that time, you could leave your doors open. We didn't have anything so no one wanted to come in there. All they could probably take was a kid and no one wanted kids. There were too many of them in the neighborhood. But I grew up there and I grew up working for the neighbors. Like I said, most of my neighbors were Italian Americans and as they got older, I worked for a lot of them and I always had money in my pocket. I was a lucky guy in that sense. But the east side was a good place. We ran around, we played ball. I started delivering papers when I was 14 years old out to this area called Goat Hill, it was part of Pueblo where probably majority were Italian Americans and by the time that I was delivering papers, the were all older people, I'd say in their sixties and seventies. Like I said, in these days a 70 year-old person looked like 85 person year does now or older. They were real tight with their money. I remember the price of newspaper was a buck 50 a month and they would pay me $0.75 every two weeks. They just wouldn't pull out a buck 50 and pay me. I guess they figured maybe they're going to die and they were going to loose $0.75 out of the deal. So there I was. I'd have to go twice a month. I spent a lot of time on that Goat Hill collecting. The part I remember about that is they sent me across to a trader park on Santa Fe and getting there, I had to go under the highway along railroad tracks to take the shortcut. There was always bums down there and there was a big wall there, and they'd sleep along that wall and they'd have this cardboard, and have fires there. I'd creep along there silently, walk as quiet as I could, and I was probably pretty quiet. But they'd see me and they say, hey, call me. Every time they call me, I'd start running and they never chased me. They weren't about to chase me, but I don't know what they ever wanted. But I didn't stick around long enough to find out.Denise Ricks: So do you remember what your parents were like when you were younger?Dennis Gonzalez: Well, my mom was a, I guess they call stay-at-home mom now. With eight kids, she had to be at home. My older sister -- she had her first set of twins when she was young, when my dad was in the war. She lost [00:10:00] her first set of twins. In fact, their names were -- she named them and one was Dennis and one was Donus. I guess she liked that name because later on, she named me Dennis. But she had the two older and then my five sisters, and my mom used to drive. There were a lot of women driving in those days. But like I said, my dad had his own garage and he always had cars available to him because he'd work on people's cars and he'd take stuff in in exchange for his mechanical work. He'd maybe get an old car from them or something. But he didn't really have old cars because he drove nice cars. He drove what you'd call hot rods today. They're pretty nice and my mom always had one. She'd take the kids to the school all the time. I remember her taking us to school on cold days and there weren't a lot of kids that were doing that. But she'd work, she'd get up, and mostly, for breakfast, she'd get Bertie to make my dad's lunch, I remember that. Because we'd get up, she'd be making -- the smell of tortillas, she'd be cooking some tortillas for my dad's at lunch. We'd all get up maybe and we'd snatch a tortilla up off the stack and slathered it with butter and salt. That was probably the best thing we used to do in them days. My dad would go to work, he worked every day. I don't remember him missing his work very often, I think he could, maybe didn't want to with eight kids around, and he'd get home at 4:30 every day. I remember running out and getting his lunchbox. I'm not sure why, because there wasn't much in it when he went to work. But supper will be ready, it'd be tortillas. Most of the time, tortillas, beans, potatoes, some chili, and if it wasn't that, we'd eating some macaroni with hamburger. What else? Something called vermicelli at that time, they call them fideo now I think. They call it fideo. We'd have that locked. But there was always plenty of food. Always plenty of food. My mom was always cooking, except on the weekends. When it was weekend time, her and my dad would dress up. Man, they dressed up nice and they'd go dancing. They loved to dance, so we'd be at home. My older sister, she was always the babysitter. She'd have to stick around and do the baby sitting. I knew she had to hate it because there was a couple of us who weren't really the most easy to get along with, and I was one of them. I was the one that wanted my way and I knew I was right. I knew I was right, but they were always wrong. My sisters and brothers were always wrong, and I thought I was right. So they had a tough time dealing with me. But she'd stick around. My sister Barbara would cook for us if they were gone, and my brother Kenny, he's six years older than me. So when I was eight, he was 14. When I was 10, he was 16. He was doing a lot of cooking too. I remember we'd want something sweet to eat and he'd break out the deep fryer. He'd make us donuts. Where'd this little kid learn how to make doughnuts, but he knew how. He was something else. It was pretty good at the time growing up.Denise Ricks: So do you feel cheated that your dad died early?Dennis Gonzalez: My dad died when he was 55 years old, I guess he was. He had retired one year from the depot. No, I don't feel cheated. I think he lived a pretty good life and I had a good time with him from the time my brother Larry went in the Air Force, I was 14 and we spent from 14 to 18 together. Spent a lot of time working around the house and I enjoyed it. The last year before he passed away, him and my mom, and me and your mom, we went on a vacation and we had bought new trucks. So we were up in the mountains fishing for a couple of weeks. We weren't even much fishermen, but we were camping and just had a great time. No, I don't feel cheated. I think the only thing I would wish that my grandkids would have a chance to to deal with him. My kids would have had a chance to spend time with him because he was a pretty awesome guy.Denise Ricks: So is that why you joined the Air Force, because your dad was a military man and your brothers were?Dennis Gonzalez: Well, my brother Kenny was drafted during Vietnam war, probably in 1966, and he went down and he was going to go to the army. The army drafted him and he went down and took a test for the Air Force, and he score pretty high in the mechanical, he was pretty sharp that way, and he was pretty lucky to get into the Air Force. At that time, he was married and had a little boy. [00:15:00] He didn't want to go into the army because he knew immediately, he'd be going straight to Vietnam, top of the war, peak of the war at that time, lot of people dying. We saw that on TV everyday of deaths. It's different than how you see the war now. But at that time, they would show them loading corpses, dead young soldiers who were 18 years old onto helicopters and taking them into... They'd show body counts. It was strange. The body count today for the Viet Cong and for the United States soldiers, and you'd say, wow, is there a balance going on? But we're losing people all the time. Anyway, he went into the Air Force about the same time my brother Larry joined the Air Force and they put their four years in, and I turned 18 in 1971. That time it was a different type of situation. They had a, what they called as the draft lottery. So what they'd do is in January of '72 for everyone who turned 18 in '71, they would draw names, birth dates. On January 1st through December 31st. They'd put that date in there and then pull your number the first guy. August 7th, number 1. They got to me, I was August. I did join prior to it but I was the luckiest ever close to a lottery. I was number 7. I would have been drafted number 7 and probably went in the army and probably went to Vietnam. But knowing that in November that year, I went down and pre-tested for the Air Force. Both my brothers at the Air Force. My dad was Army Air Corps. So that was the natural place for me to go, and I went down and signed up and didn't go right away, wait around until... I was waiting to get into college and I couldn't get the money. I couldn't get no money to go to college, so I stuck around the house, worked a few jobs. The low-fee job at that time was a 7-Eleven quick way. By that time, I guess I'm 18 years old. I'm thinking I'm a man but I'm still living in my dad's house. He tightened up the rules on me and I said, ""Well, you know what? I'm not 15 anymore. I'm 18. I'm going,"" He said, ""Hey, enjoy it. "" So I did. I joined up, and went in the military in January 17th of 1972 and went to basic training there in San Antonio, Texas. Probably one of the most things that I remember about going to the Air Force is the first day we got there, I went up to Denver and it's a shock. I didn't want my -- I guess I'm sentimental, so I didn't want my mom to take me up to Denver and cry when I'm getting on the bus. So I told her and my dad, ""You could drop me off down at the bus station in Pueblo and I'll take the bus up to Denver."" Told them, ""it'll be tomorrow and I'm gone."" So he agreed to that. My dad agreed to that. He thought it was a good idea. So he took me up to the bus depot down on, I think it was on 5th Court at that time. I remember waving to them goodbye and then going up to Denver. I was maybe a mile from the hotel we're going to stay at is the Oxford. It's a top of the line place up in Denver now. I mean, I couldn't afford to spend the night there now, but at that time, it was a rundown place and they had an elevator man. So you had to get in the elevator and go on up to your room. I remember them giving me some vouchers to eat because it was late when I got there. So I walked across the street and it's the Bowery in Denver. Well it's around Coors Field now, so it's not so bad now. But then it was the Bowery and there's bums sleeping on the streets. I remember walking into it was a restaurant, bar, and grill that I was supposed to take my voucher. I walked in this bar and I says,""You know what? I can't eat in this place."" This looks grubby to me, so I went back to the hotel. I ran into people who, we're all being inducted. We're all young guys, some going in Marines, some going in the Navy, myself and others in the Air Force, and we spent the night out drinking. Going out to bars and getting a little rowdy. Cops took us back. They didn't take us back, they directed us back to the hotel. I didn't sleep that night. People were in the room and they partied on. So I remember I was so tired when I got to Texas that day. I remember them. We got there, these guys running outside [00:20:00] of their barracks with just their underwear on. I said, ""What's going on? Why are these guys running in their underwear?"" Guy tells us, ""Don't worry, you'll be doing that."" They did. They would have you have fire drills, or if you did something, you didn't do the fire drill good at night, the middle of the afternoon, you'd go in there and you'd lay in bed and, ""Fire drill! "" You'd get up. So I remember them letting you run outside in your underwear in middle winter, of course, Texas wasn't that cold, but that's one of the things I remember.Denise Ricks: So do you remember your time in the military? What were your strongest memories of being where you were stationed?Dennis Gonzalez: I went to a tech school in Texas also and I went for an intercept analyst as a Russian intercept analyst. But it wasn't that I was going to learn to speak Russian. We had linguists for that. What we would do is a linguist would, what they do is they fly an airplane along a periphery of Russia and they have listening posts in Turkey at that time. We'd get information, and then it was my job to read and see what was going on. If there's anything that was of any intelligence that we could gather from that. Well, that's what I went to school for was German intercept. But when I got to, I went to NSA in Washington and I became a watch operator with the guy who just took in the information that came off the teletype, intelligence off the teletype. I did that for a few months and I got involved with the reconnaissance shop. At that time, they were flying the U-2 and the SR-71 over Vietnam, and U-2 we flew in a lot of other places. It was so exciting that I would just spend my time helping out guys. They took me over right away and first-time a position came open, they took me in there. I became a shop leader right away, because I loved it. I just loved to make them kind of decisions and follow that plane. SR-71 was going on top thing in reconnaissance at that time. I was a crew leader for that as far as reporting intelligence on it, so it was exciting going to work every day. I was 19 years old, so top of the world at that time.Denise Ricks: So did you learn any lessons from being in the military that you carried on with you in your life?Dennis Gonzalez: Oh, I don't think so. I still fold my socks the same way they taught me. I fold my underwear the way they taught me. That's the things you carry with you. That which you learned in the first six weeks of school it stays with you forever. Actually, I spent an extra week in basic training because I was set back. Not because I couldn't do it, because like I said, I told you I had a little trouble following authority at that time, and I'd get hungry at night. So I snack down and got me a candy bar and they caught me and they set me back a week, and I was fine. They had to wait for me to start my class anyway.Denise Ricks: That's how you well, not met mom, but got to know mom, right? Being in the military?Dennis Gonzalez: Actually, I was in Washington DC at the time I first got there. I waited about a month and I called a friend of mine, her name was Shirley. Shirley was excited that I got there and called me and says, ""Stay where you're at, I'll go get you."" So she did and we followed her down to her apartment and we went out to dinner. In fact, she had invited me over for Thanksgiving dinner and I said, ""I got to work. I can't make it."" She said, ""Well, don't worry. Come over Saturday and we'll go."" I said, ""Okay."" So Saturday I went over for Thanksgiving dinner, she cooked the turkey, and she was a nice lady, it was just good. But I went back about two or three weeks later, I guess, I went back and knocked on her door and she had moved and she hadn't left the address. So I went downstairs. I knew that a friend of mine also lived there, Linda, your mom's sister, your aunt Linda. So I knocked on the door to see if Linda may have known where Shirley had moved to. At that time, your mom -- someone answered the door and this is your mamma sitting there. She says, ""Come on in."" I went in there. The apartment was shared by three girls, your mommy, Aunt Linda, and another girl the time. I went in there and I saw your mom sitting there on the chair. She's sitting on her knees and she's crocheting. I remember she's crocheting, and she had long hair down to her waist at that time. I knew her from high school, but we just weren't friends, didn't care much for her in high school. Just that I knew her. Anyway, her waist-long hair was rolled up with these tomato paste cans. At that [00:25:00] time, I guess instead of getting big rollers, her hair was so long she'd get these tomato cans. I went in there, big smile on her face, and they were cooking. I remember somebody's cooking. I tell the story that I say, ""You know what? This is it."" This lady, you don't need to spend no money on hair. She does her hair with tomato cans. She cooks. She crochets. I say, ""She probably sews."" I says, ""Man, this is it."" She told us, ""Stick around."" I was with a friend and, ""Stick around. We're going out today and we can go out to Georgetown. We're going dancing."" I did not dance, but I said, ""Sure."" So we went and well, first off, a guy showed up to pick her up. I guess she was going on a date. I didn't realize it. But she had asked us come to along and at that time, I was driving a '73 Dodge Charger. Nice car. So I said, ""We'll go in my car."" The guy said, ""No, we'll go in my car."" He had him a Starsky and Hutch Torino. Pretty nice car, but we went in his car anyway. I think I can remember that because I said, ""Well, I want to drive my car."" But we went in his car and we got to this place in Georgetown, and I remember walking to it. What was it called then, I don't remember what it was called, but we walked there, and it was probably a dollar each, maybe two dollars each to get in at that time. Your mom's date took out pay for two and your mom says, ""Oh, no, no, no."" She goes, ""I'll pay for my own."" At that time, I thought, ""Well, this is no date. He didn't pay for her to get in."" So I took the opportunity to dance with her and I think from then on, we've been together since. That was in, wow, 1973, something like that. So yes, in '73. We didn't get married right away. It took us a few years. In fact, it took us five years before I... in fact, it took six years. I married her in '79, and a year and three months later, you were born. So yeah, that's the best part of my military service, I guess, was meeting your mom up there.Denise Ricks: Do you remember, because I was your oldest, so do you remember me being born and what was that were like?Dennis Gonzalez: Yeah, it was crazy. It was crazy. That time, we had bought a house. In 1978, we bought a house and we got married a couple of months later. Your mom became pregnant in a few months after that. I remember I was working this job out-of-town for a while. I was working for a phone company at the time as an electronic equipment installer. I was on the road and I called her from my motel room and I says, ""You know, I've been on the road so long that I want to come home."" She said, ""Quit the job, quit it tomorrow."" So I said, ""Okay."" The next day I called and I quit the job, and I got a job at the army depot when I got back as a guard. The day that you were born as I was getting ready to go to work, I remember in my uniform, I was getting ready to go to work, and she says, ""You can't go to work. I'm going to have the baby."" I said, ""No."" She said, ""Yeah."" I threw her in the car. We got you in the car and drove the car in a hospital. I remember, right away they says, ""You have to wait here,"" and she says, ""I can't wait."" So we got up there and we weren't there, maybe an hour and you were born. It was that easy. Like, wow, that's easy. With the other three sisters, it got harder and harder seeing, especially when we got Angela. But yeah, I remember that day. The day I do remember is when Angela was born and me taking... I remember taking you to the hospital one day dressed up as Raggedy Ann.Denise Ricks: It had to have been when Teresa was born.Dennis Gonzalez: Yeah, when Teresa was born.Denise Ricks: On Halloween.Dennis Gonzalez: Yeah. There you go. Teresa was born on Halloween, and that's when I took you. But I also remember taking you to the hospital when Teresa was born and I spent half an hour getting you dressed. It took a long time. I don't know what I did, but I went downstairs to find my clothes, I guess, and when I came back up to get you, you had decided to climb back in the tub, and you're soaking wet. So here I was starting all over again. I do remember that. I do remember when the songs that I have with four daughters, I remember most of it. I remember all of them because me and your mom would go alone to the hospital. We wouldn't call her mom and dad or anybody till they were born because I wanted to be there with her. I wanted to share that with her. But as Sarah grew up and I remember singing a newer song when I was little. When you were little and you were the oldest, I used to sing... How does the song go? It goes something like, ""I have a little girl. Her name is Teresa Marie. I've got another little daughter, I call her [00:30:00] Stephanie. I got another daughter, I call her boom, boom, boom. I got another daughter, but the song don't have no room,"" and you'd cry, you'd really cry. You must have been four years old, already five years old, maybe older than that, but you would just cry and cry.Denise Ricks: So do you remember me being trouble as a child? Was I a trouble maker?Dennis Gonzalez: You were the easiest kid. No trouble, easy to get along with, everything that I would suggest that you did, most of the time you did. I'd run, you wanted to be a runner. I remember the races you ran in. I remember, you tried to win, it's a turkey for Thanksgiving one year. I don't think you won.Denise Ricks: I don't think so either.Dennis Gonzalez: But you'd continue to win after that. I remember that through high school. Probably the hardest thing I ever had with you, as I recall, remembering is, is when you were deciding that I'm going to be on my own. I'm going to find my own man now. That was hard on me. It's hard, but it has worked out. I'm happy for you now. I've no problems.Denise Ricks: So do you have any regrets now about your life or anything that you'd change?Dennis Gonzalez: I kind of regret that I didn't -- I don't have regrets that I didn't do it because my life would had been different if I would have stayed in the Air Force. They wanted me to go to several places overseas at that time and do a couple of different things, and I decided that wasn't for me. They've even brought me in and talked to me and I said, ""Well, I want to go to college."" They says, ""You know, right now where you're going, you might be better off than going to college."" I says, ""No, my goal is college."" But I never made it back to college. I spent probably -- I'm saying, I didn't make it back. I never graduated. I didn't make it to go to school, but it was always a part-time basis because I had probably the ability to go to college. I just didn't have that drive that I want to spend time in school. Life was nice to go out and shoot a game of pool, play game, basketball, play softball, ride my bike. A lot of times I say, ""Well, maybe if I'd been more goal-oriented, maybe I would have got my degree and be in a different situation,"" but no regrets. I lived in a pretty good life. I've always had -- I've never been broke. I've always been able to get by and have a pretty good life, take my kids to the mountains, take them on vacations, help them with their education, and no, no regrets whatsoever. Now, with grandkids, they're the greatest because now I have boys again. I mean, boys now that I never had, and even though I would consider you the most tomboyish of them all. I mean, I taught you to drive my pickups. You worked with me on the yards when I was doing yard work and stuff. So no, I have no regrets, no.Denise Ricks: Is there a certain way that you want your family to remember you or stories that you want them to pass down about you?Dennis Gonzalez: Probably, I have no certain way I want to be remembered, especially the people that are friends and acquaintances. They know what I am, they know how I am. A lot of them likes talk to me and I enjoy talk with people. But how my kids remember me as, I'm not so sure. I just hope they have their own personal way of remembering me. I hope it's not all the same way they'd remember me. I hope they'll have their own personal way to say, ""Hey, I love papa because of this,"" or, ""I love papa because of that,"" or my grandkids the same way. Other than that, I hope my wife, and we didn't really talk a lot about. But Yolanda, she's been the greatest thing for me ever in my life. I mean, my greatest. I didn't have any other goals, but all I knew is that I wanted to have a nice place for her to live. I provided that. She worked all along too. She never complained. She's never complained about it, not for the lack of anything, and I think that's what I love. I hope she has. If I go before her, hope she has a great life after that, and hope her daughters remember her. Some of the great times now I still think about is when I see you and your sisters there at the house when she's doing things, or sitting around, just talking and having breakfast. I mean, I think that's great. But how I want to be remembered, I just hope each and every one of my girls and my grandkids have their own memory, and I hope it's a good memory.Denise Ricks: Is there anything about me that you've always wanted to ask, but you never have?Dennis Gonzalez: [00:35:00] No. I think I probably knew you better than I knew the rest of the girls. You kind of did the direction we asked you to go into, you didn't give us too many problems that I can recall. You drove that Ford Escort like it was a Corvette, but it was nice. Anything I want to ask you? No, I was happy that you brought Malachi and Kyla back into Pueblo and they're close to me. Other than that, I just hope you live a great life.Denise Ricks: Is there anything that I haven't done that you thought I would or that you always thought I would do?Dennis Gonzalez: No. I think it's taking you too long to get that degree. I honestly think that you could done that a couple of years ago, but you raised your kids. Your kids are in school now so now's a good time to... And your goal is set right now. So yeah, I'm glad for you, Denise.Denise Ricks: Well, I'm happy you came.Dennis Gonzalez: Thanks for asking me. I didn't think I could sit here and talk for 35 minutes.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
MBY005884,"Heidi Christine Johnson: [00:00:00] Hi. My name is Heidi Christine Johnson. I'm 38 years old. Today is October 25th, 2009. I'm here in Wichita, Kansas with my friend and employer, Randolph Cabral.Randolph Cabral: Hi. My name is Randolph Cabral. I'm 54 years old. Today is October 25th, 2009, here in Wichita, Kansas. I am the founder and president of the Kansas Braille Transcription Institute. I'm here with Heidi Christine Johnson, who is more than just my employee, she's my best friend and I wanted her here today.Heidi Christine Johnson: Okay. Who or what inspired your interest in Braille and led you to found KBTI and create the American Braille flag?Randolph Cabral: That's my father, my dad Jesus Sanchez, Chuy Cabral. Dad and I have always been really close and we worked together, he was in the construction atmosphere. Later in life, he started losing his sight, he developed glaucoma and as his sight started diminishing the family started looking at ways to help dad out. I decided to give up my career, I'd been an engineer in construction and highway mostly and thought I'm going to learn all I can about braille and sight loss. I entered a program with the Laser Library Service to learn braille transcription and started learning braille and about the industry to the blind and started giving that information to the rest of my family members to help dad out. It was very instructional and it helped a lot with getting him into the reading program where the libraries had books on tape. Dad was an avid reader, though he couldn't read print anymore and he did not learn Braille, he was still able to appreciate literature by listening to it.Heidi Christine Johnson: Now, your father was not born in America. Tell us a little about your father and what his life was like prior to and after he came to America.Randolph Cabral: Well, my dad came to this country at about the age of two. He was born I think in 1916. He was born in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. At that time there was a revolutionary war going on, Civil War. It was a rather long lasting war, one of the last long series of the Mexican-Indian wars and that was from 1910-1920. My grandfather was somewhat of land bearer, he had a lot of land there in Zacatecas. The war was over, much of the land and my grandfather decided he was not going to leave and give up his land, so my grandfather told my grandmother, ""take the kids, go to the United States and once this is over we'll send for you and you'll comeback."" Unfortunately, my grandfather didn't survive the war, he was killed. My grandmother and my aunts and uncles, my father made it to Chicago and they started fresh in Chicago.Heidi Christine Johnson: When your father came to his adopted country, he was barely two years of age, like you'd said. What if any effect do you recall this had on him and how did his growing up in America affect you?Randolph Cabral: I think my dad had some, I don't know if ambivalence is the right word but my dad, he always seemed to be a little bit confused about his cultural identity. Even though when in Chicago, though my grandmother and my aunts and uncles and my dad came here together, it was somewhat of a wave. I mean, there were a lot of Mexican families that left because of the war and migrated to the United States. My dad came here, of course, growing up to love his adopted country, but it was maybe a question of, ""am I Mexican or am I American? Where are my loyalties?"" It was very obvious in getting to known my father as I grew up with him that America had become his home and he considered himself an American. Even though he was here illegally, the whole family was, this was his country. This is the country that he fled to with his family, saved him from maybe the same consequences my grandfather experienced then, this is home for him.Heidi Christine Johnson: Now, you said your father worked on the railroad. Why did your father choose to work on the railroad?[5:00]Randolph Cabral: Well, I think initially [00:05:00] the railroad was how they managed to get to Chicago. The weren't a lot of lines back then, railroad lines but I think a lot of the migrants what they did is they'd hop these boxcars and that's how they made it from one point to another point then. Because there was a high concentration of Mexicans going to Chicago because of the railroad, Union Pacific, Santa Fe and other railroads that customarily they decided to work on the railroad. My dad did the same, he worked on the railroad as he was growing up in Chicago and that was kind of how he got his start. Most of the Mexicans were working there. You have to remember too, War World II World War I was going on at the same time here in the United States, so there was a shortage of laborers. You had these Mexican immigrants who were here illegally, probably couldn't have actually joined the war, my father would have been a little too young at that point anyway. The railroad was hiring and so my dad did, he and my uncles they went to work for the railroad.Heidi Christine Johnson: You said that your father entered the war. What prompted your father to enter the war?Randolph Cabral: There was a combination of things. One thing is, now this is World War II, at that time my understanding of American history at that time was, it wasn't so much a matter of do you want to enlist. As much as it was, they had a draft going on. Naturally, to you feeling very patriotic, I mean here's a country that he came to, he was now secure in and he felt a sense of loyalty to America an obligation and a duty to enter the war. Now, there were some promises as well, that if you were in this country illegally or otherwise, and you fought for America, if you were illegal at the end of the war, if you survived it, you'd be given your passage to citizenship. There was quite a lot of things that prompted him, one he was a young man, he was starting to come to know kind of who he was, where he was and this war going on, he audited the country to go out and fight and of course, he wanted to be an American citizen.Heidi Christine Johnson: Did your father appear to feel more like an American after serving in the armed forces?Randolph Cabral: I think in many respects he did. I think there was a certain sense of pride, though he didn't talk about the war a lot, maybe just in general. I think it did make him feel more like, I did not just migrate here. I stayed here, I've made a home here, I have fought to preserve everything America stands for. So it makes him feel a little bit more American because I fought for this country. But at the same time after the war, one thing that occurred was my dad did not get his right to citizenship, it was denied, him and many other illegal immigrants, not just from Mexico, but other parts of the world. There was a lot of discrimination against Hispanic Americans or Mexicans, which is really interesting because even when my dad followed the railroad lines to Hutchinson, where I was born, and he went to school, my father's English was poor. He did not get the best of education in Chicago because he was working. Even when he was a young boy, he was working. So he went to school at an older age, even in Hutchinson. He wanted to get a high school diploma. He thought that was another thing that you needed to have as an American. But schools were segregated. African Americans and European Americans went to schools together but Mexicans, they had their own school and it was behind the big school. Even after my father had fought in the war and came back, Mexicans were still somewhat segregated from other nationalities and Americans. You lived in a different part of town, when you entered stores or went anywhere, you went through the back door, you didn't go through the front door. Again, African Americans could go through the front door, but Mexicans couldn't. I'm not really sure why that was, but I do remember my mom telling me once that my dad had gotten fed up with that. There was a big sign on the front of this grocery store window that said, ""Mexicans, remember to use the back door,"" and my dad went through the front door. He went in and got a few groceries and put his money down and the guy at the counter told him, ""You're not going to get this. I'm not taking your money because you did not come through the back door."" My dad stomped out, pulled the sign off the front of the window, went to sheriff's department, and he knew the sheriff fairly well, and he told him, ""Look, I fought in this country. I have every right to be considered an American [00:10:00] and I'm not going to put up with being treated this way."" So the sheriff went with my dad back to this little grocery store and he told the grocery store owner, he said, ""If it wasn't for men like Mr. Cabral, you wouldn't even have a grocery store and it's only good for you to have that sign there and I don't ever want to see it there again and there'll be no more Mexicans coming through the back door."" So I think in some ways my dad stood up and he wanted, again, to be recognized as a full-fledged American, he wasn't going to be discriminated against that way. So I think he was fighting to prove that he was an American. I think he did that his entire life and that bled over into us kids as well. We had to speak English real well, we had to get a good education, we had to have a good work ethic. Like him, we had to enter the military service and we had to be proud of being Americans and I think that he may have felt too, if everybody sees that my kids are good Americans, then they'll know that I am too and that their mother is too. It just always seemed to be so important to him.Heidi Christine Johnson: Did your father retire from the railroad?Randolph Cabral: No. Actually, he left the railroad. What had happened to part of the migration with many of the Mexicans leaving Chicago was if you've worked on the railroad tracks and you agreed that if they was got to put a railroad depot somewhere in any particular part of the country, if you agreed to travel to that location and stay there and work, the railroad would help you acquire land. Well, that's how my dad ended up in Hutchinson and the land that he got and he built a house on. But when the railroad said, okay, we're moving to another location and I don't know where. Does anybody want to come along? My dad was stopped and told, ""We'd like you to go to whatever part of the country they were going to put in their next depot."" He said, ""No, I've made my roots here, not just in Kansas, and I'm going to stay here."" So he had the option, either go or finding another job. He decided that he was going to try his hand in the construction atmosphere, and that's what he ended up doing. He joined the Union, AFL-CIO, and started doing construction work.Heidi Christine Johnson: Okay. How long did he stay in the construction industry?Randolph Cabral: His whole life. This was shortly after the war. He had gone back to work at the railroad and then returned to Hutchinson. So he was probably in his mid to late 30s or early 30s probably. So about 40 years he worked in the construction business. He even started a small construction business of his own. He subcontracted with bigger businesses and had a buddy that he worked with sheet rocking, bricklaying, blocklaying, masonry work, something he taught all of us kids as well, all of us boys, anyway,Heidi Christine Johnson: Yeah, I was curious. How did your father and your mother meet?Randolph Cabral: That's an interesting story because my dad was over in Italy during the war and my mother, her family is from Sicily, on her father's side, my grandfather's side, and my mother was helping in the war effort. My dad caught her eye, they caught each other's eyes and my dad approached her and told her he thought she was attractive and he had an interest in her, could they go out and see each other? My mother explained to him, ""I'm here helping with the war effort."" She'd probably heard that from a lot of GIs and so she brushed him off. But then shortly thereafter, my dad ended up in Africa and he was fighting over there in Northern and Eastern Africa, and here my mother was again. She was helping out over there as well and he spotted her and approached her and he told her it was their destiny, they were meant to be together and he wanted to be with her. She said, ""Well, let's wait and see after the war. If we survive it, you get in touch with me, here's how to reach me. We'll go from there."" Ultimately, that's what happened after the war. They had been corresponding and my mother had come back to the States, here in the United States, and they were corresponding and then when the war was over, my dad came back to Hutchinson and he sent for my mother and she came to Hutchinson and they got married.Heidi Christine Johnson: Okay. I know you have a large family of origin. Can you tell me where do you fall in number, and the number of brothers and sisters you have?Randolph Cabral: Well, I have 11 siblings or I did, two of my sisters have since passed and one of my brothers, but I was virtually smack in the middle in many respects. There's set of twins below me and [00:15:00] four other siblings and then I had four older than me, so in the middle. There was 11 of us all together.Heidi Christine Johnson: Okay. Were you a close family?Randolph Cabral: Very close and probably in all manner to speak, close still because we were somewhat of a closed net family. We grew up in what was referred to as Brown Town in Hutchinson, that was predominantly Mexican. I don't like to say Hispanic a lot because we use Hispanic in this country today to describe all so-called Latino Americans or Latinos. To me it takes away from being Mexican as my father was and that part of the city that we lived in was all Hispanic or all Mexican. We stuck to ourselves, the schools were there in our area, everything we did was right there. I had a lot of family members that came from Mexico that also lived in Hutchinson. So we were clannish, everybody would hang around with, did things with family members, relatives, and if they were not direct relatives, our families knew each other. You could go to just about any place within that maybe half mile circumference and you knew each other or your families knew each other. Say you might go spend the night at maybe the Daugherty's house or the Mendoza's house or the Hernandez's house. They had as many kids as we did, if not more. You didn't have to worry about, what am I going to wear to school tomorrow? Because with everybody having so many kids, you could just go into a closet or find something to put on and put it on and go to school. So that's the way I grew up at our immediate family, of course, we're very close, five brothers. We're all a year apart. Everything we did, we did together; sports, going to mass, parochial schools, we did it all. Just very close. We went everywhere together, did everything together.Heidi Christine Johnson: Are you still good friends with your brothers and sisters right now?Randolph Cabral: Yeah. We really haven't separated that much and we don't have any family members that are living outside of Kansas, not immediate, no. I have brothers that live outside of Wichita like I'm here in Wichita. We're from Hutchinson. But we stay in contact with each other, email, phone calls, and then of course, going home. Though dad's not there anymore, we go there see see mom regularly. All the girls live in Hutchinson still and my youngest brother lives in Hutchinson. We still have our family get-togethers and they have their families, of course, and so that takes away a little bit but for the most part, yeah. When there's a need, when something comes up, you can always count on one or the other, brothers or sisters, to be there for you when you need them.Heidi Christine Johnson: Yeah. Who would you say you're the closest to?Randolph Cabral: My brother, Pat. He's a year older than I am and we're always very close. In school, he was this school quarterback and I was the receiver. In baseball, I was the pitcher, he was the catcher. We always practice sports together. Jeff, very athletic too, but he was more in track and field and he broke a lot of records, had a lot of records in high school that I had heard maybe 15 years ago, where one of his long jumps had just finally been broken after all those years, but he was extremely athletic. We were closer then, I was in track and field too, but not to the degree he was. But Pat and I, we could almost be twins. We spend a lot of time talking to each other and visiting with each other and it's just always been that way.Heidi Christine Johnson: What is Pat doing now?Randolph Cabral: He's with the Kansas Corporation Commission. After he got out of the Army, he used the GI Bill, went to school and studied law. Here was going to be a civil rights lawyer, and he had met his wife in South Carolina and he got in one of the marches. He got banged around a little bit in one of the marches, and his wife told him, they weren't married then. She said, ""No, no way."" She calls him Patrick Gail, ""You're not going to be a Civil Rights Attorney, going into to tax law or something else, but you're not going to be doing this."" So he came back to Kansas, went to Washburn University in KU, and got his law degree. Went to work for vocational rehabilitation, representing them in welfare fraud cases. At some point he thought maybe they were being too hard on some of the recipients, so he switched and decided to become a representative for individuals that we're getting State Assistance. Then he saw that maybe they were taking [00:20:00] advantage of the State. So he got a big Winnebago. He got permission from the State, and he filled it up with a bunch of educational materials, started traveling around the State teaching life skills. Then his wife and the kids felt he was away from home too much. So he went back and left VR and went to work doing primarily the same thing, research for the Kansas Corporation Commission, and consulting, and handling disputes with utility companies. That's what he does now.Heidi Christine Johnson: That's good. I just have one more question. What is your mom doing now?Randolph Cabral: Well, mom is mom, she's the matriarch of the family. She was the superglue that always kept us all together, good times and bad. Though she's up in age now and she has health issues. She still have a lot of grandkids, my nephews and nieces, and great grandkids that come around and mom is still there to cook, and clean, and lecture, and tutor, and do all of those things. Life's been a little difficult for her since my sister Judy passed last year. Mom and Judy had been together Judy's entire life. Judy never married, she worked for the Sheriff Department. She never married, and it was just she and mom. Even when mom was taking care of dad before he died. So now she's alone. She does have a little dog and she's always available, but she's doing well.Heidi Christine Johnson: That's good. Your father began experiencing vision problems later in life. What was that like for him?Randolph Cabral: I think it was almost a relation of my dad. My dad was a very visual person, and I think one thing he really enjoyed doing, even after he retired from work in the construction business, he loved to walk around town and see what other new buildings were going up or what buildings were coming down. He'd want to go there and talk to whoever the laborers were, and he'd want to talk about, ""Oh, I worked on this building and that building and who's the contractor? Who's the subcontractor,"" and those kinds of things. But when he lost his sight, he wasn't able to do that anymore. Like I said, he was an avid reader, he loved to read and he'd like to share stories that he read. But when he lost his sight, that really took everything away from him. One of the other things that my dad always did, and I knew this growing up as a kid, my dad always put the American flag out on the front porch, and on special holidays when the flag was to be prominently displayed, you could not leave the front porch, can't even go into the front yard until that flag was put up there. Now, once he want up there saluted it or honored it or whatever, nobody leaves the house without the flag being posted. My mom was telling me one day, she said, ""You know, dad's sight has gotten really bad, he has glaucoma"" that affect about 40 percent of the Hispanics. My dad had grabbed her head scarf and he didn't know that that wasn't the flag. He was trying to figure out where's the stick, who pulled the flag off the stick? My mom was sharing that with me. It was at that point to that, and I don't know why nobody took the time to put the flag out there for him. That was about the last where we really saw the flag out there [inaudible 00:23:30] several years later. But that was one of the standing rules growing up, and when he couldn't see the flag anymore, I think that took a lot away from him too, because again, he lived wanting people to know I'm an American. Putting the flag out there was another way of communicating to passers-by or anyone else, we're Americans, we're American family, and here's our American flag. You'll know that at this home, we're Americans here.Heidi Christine Johnson: Yeah. So that's how you got started in learning about blindness? Can you tell me a little bit about your history on how you learn braille?Randolph Cabral: Yeah, actually, I knew that it was going to be important to learn as much as I cared about blindness for my dad's sake, and to put the rest of the family at ease too because we were all ignorant of what was involved in the blind culture. I had worked in a library as an Assistant Librarian at one point in time and I can recall that one day a big box came in and it was full of braille, and it was the first time that I had ever really seen braille. The Head Librarian explained to me that we'd gotten that accidentally and it needed to be shipped somewhere else. But inside [00:25:00] that box, there was a piece of paper that was in there by the Library of Congress, that reading effect, ""If you're blind or if you know somebody that's blind and you'd like to learn braille, Library of Congress has a free program for learning braille."". So I never forgot that, and when dad had lost his sight completely, I contacted the Library of Congress, and I asked them, ""Can I learn braille, and how do I go about learning braille?"" Well, here in Wichita, Kansas, the American Red Cross had given space to a group of ladies who were braille transcriber, and Von Willer became my proctor, wonderful woman, elderly German woman, very stern, strict teacher. She was my teacher and I became a certified braille transcriber.Heidi Christine Johnson: You also have some degrees?Randolph Cabral: Yeah.Heidi Christine Johnson: You operate the Kansas Braille Transcription Institute here in Wichita, Kansas, but do you have some degrees that have helped you manage business here?Randolph Cabral: Well, I knew that there was going to be many other people like my dad who are blind, and that there would be others that would need this kind of help as well, whether it was educational or advocacy, or actually braille or anything else. So I started doing a lot of independent research to begin with, and a lot of my friends from church, I'd been discussing with them, there's a real need for a transcription service or braille related service in Kansas, because it was not one, not an actual one, so we discussed forming one. Now, I was operating Kansas Braille Transcription Institute out of my place of residence at that time, but it wasn't chartered. So with the church group, I decided we would form a non-profit organization. I knew that if I was going to be running a business, that I needed to get more of a background in business, so that I would be able to do that in a more professional manner. So I went back to school, got an undergraduate in Business and Human Resources, and while attending Friends University in Wichita, I also did a research methodology on what is the need for braille at the post-secondary education level. The research outcomes reflected that there was an overwhelming need for an institute like this, but at the same time, the research also indicated that Kansas wasn't ready, they weren't interested, they wanted to maintain the status quo, and a lot of people that I spoke to suggested that I just stick to doing what I'd been doing and dispense with the idea of establishing an institute. But I went ahead and did it anyway with the board members and we founded it, and Heidi became my Vice President.Heidi Christine Johnson: What did your father think about all of the work that you were doing?Randolph Cabral: My dad was very proud of me in many ways, but at the same time, I don't think he really liked that I left the construction industry, because he needed somebody to talk to about construction work. He would call me, we used to talk and he'd say, ""What projects are they working on here or there, or, how's this coming longer? How's that coming along?"" He had taught me brick and block laying, and plastering, and now I wasn't doing that. Initially, I was an inspector, my job was to inspect contractors for the State, are you mixing the concrete right, the asphalt, are you laying the rebar right, is it the right dimensions, has the ground been suppressed, properly for all these different things. My dad didn't really want to hear about that, he wanted to hear about bricks and blocks going up. Those are the things that he really wanted to talk about. Then of course, when I switched from that completely, I think he was a little disappointed, but my dad and my mom both had always been of the position, follow your heart, do what you want to do, and be good at whatever you're doing. So I think he realized that I was giving up something that was important to me as well, but I was doing it for him and I was doing for others like him. So I think he was proud of me for doing that.Heidi Christine Johnson: Can you describe a little bit what is like to learn braille? Like, how the process.Randolph Cabral: Braille, it takes a person that has a tremendous amount of dedication to be a good transcriber. I don't say that to inflate myself, but braille is a combination of raised dots. There is actually six dots that [00:30:00] form what's referred to as a braille cell. If you could picture a dye with six dots, two rows of three dots, or two columns or three dots, that is a full cell. From those six dots, you make a number of combinations, and from those combinations, you can braille just about any normal language in the world. You can also create illustrations, pictures. We do higher mathematics, scientific notation. Heidi in fact, has always been the braille instructor, she's been with me 10, 11 years probably, and she's been instrumental in teaching. I got many, many people throughout the State in the country. Braille is a form of logic as well. It's very similar to mathematics and music. So you have to have very logical mind, and it requires, like a lot of dedication, a lot of strict proofreading and so many rules that have to be followed. Well, nobody is expected to memorize all of them, you have to know where they're located. So to be a transcriber, it takes a tremendous amount of dedication.Heidi Christine Johnson: Do you remember the first thing that you read in braille?Randolph Cabral: Yeah, actually I do because I wrote it down. I wrote a story about a little boy, who lived with his aunt, and his aunt owned a big house and a small house, and he did not understand, why do we have to live in a small house, why can't we live in the big house? But the big house had ghost in it, and the aunt knew that and she was afraid of that ghost then. But the little boy, he wasn't completely in agreement that there was ghost there to begin with, that there was any reason not to live there. So he went there and he actually ended up scaring the ghost, and the ghost did not want him to tell anybody that he had scared him, and now they made an agreement the ghost to move into the small house and the aunt and the boy would live in the big house. I did that because one of the things that's important is to always read braille, so I wrote this little story and I read it all the time so that I wouldn't forget how to read braille and how to do braille.Heidi Christine Johnson: Your dad died not too long ago and you founded Kansas Braille Transcription Institute in his memory. What things is KBTI noted for?Randolph Cabral: Today advocacy, just like today, in the United States today, you have the H1N1 flu virus, and nobody had thought about putting that in braille, and it took a little bit of arm twisting in mentioning, ofs to civil rights and the Department of Justice to get Kansas the government compliance. But there were so many people calling the institute and wanting this information. So lucky today we do a lot of advocacy, but of course, we do a tremendous amount of braille to colleges, universities from around the country, state and federal agencies, city, private businesses, private individuals, we still train, we have the distance learning program, we created actually the very first distance learning program, real distance learning program in the nation. We had to bring people in from Sri Lanka and India to write the programs. What you'd be familiar with, because you are acquainted with many of them as well. So those are some of the things that we've done that have been very unique, that new food pyramid, it had never been in braille before, and the FDA gave us that contract, and so what pioneers were daily pioneers always doing something new and always wanting to keep the industry moving.Heidi Christine Johnson: Now one thing that you created that is going to be a lasting memory for you as the Braille American flag, how did that come about?Randolph Cabral: Then that started with my mother when she made the comment about my dad taking her head scarf and thinking it was the flag, and then later commenting, you founded the school and dad's memory and everything and he did a for him and you've done all this primarily for him. You know how much he loved the American flag. Why don't you give him a flag he could continue to see? I don't know why didn't it just never occurred to me. So I went online, I started googling and researching Braille American flags, tactile flags, the only flag I really came across was what's called a Braille flag. But it's not actually a Braille flag, is the flag that's used on ships, out at sea when they have planes that come in and land on aircrafts, you see the men out there, women out there with sometimes flashlights or actual flags that are directing the planes and the jets in, that's called a Braille flag, nobody knows why, but that was all there was, and I thought, well, you know what, I'm going to spend some time, I stayed in the office late that night, [00:35:00] and knowing all the rules of braille and having done so many tactile graphics, I formed, recreated the Braille American flag.Heidi Christine Johnson: There's one thing that I would like, because I think this is the neatest thing about the Braille flag, but it's at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington DC, where else can we go to view the Braille American flag?Randolph Cabral: Well, here in Wichita at the Veterans Memorial, there's one placed here into peak, there are two there actually, there's one at the Veterans Memorial into Pico, and then right before Governor Sebelius left to go to Washington DC, we had to go in front of the full senate here in Kansas to the four legislature, just as we did at the US Capital to get it in Arlington, though we're to do that here in Kansas. So now we have a monument of the flag at the state capitol appearing to peaker, Emporia, Kansas being the founding city of Veterans Day, they've five of them, one in their library, two at various memorials in their city building, El Dorado, Kansas, and there's been requesting from around the country are the places that we'd like to have one as well.Heidi Christine Johnson: I know because I heard about it, but President Obama has a Braille flag.Randolph Cabral: Yeah. I met with him and that is interesting, he was campaigning at the time, but I had been asked by the Democratic Party to present him with one behalf of blinded Americans and blinded Veterans. So something I really screwy there, and the gal that was directing me and was supposed to be getting me over to the president, she got lost in the crowd, and here I'm trying to convince Secret Service have to meet with them and to present them with this flag, and I didn't know anything about it. So he was getting ready to walk off and I had to climb up a flight of bleachers, and over and around people I'm on yelling his name, and he turned around on his heels and he came back.Heidi Christine Johnson: He said, ""What do you want?""Randolph Cabral: What do you want? I said, ""Well, I'm here to present you with this Braille American flag on behalf of our nation's blinded veterans and other blind civilians"", and he said, ""Well, let me see it,"" I climbed down and that was going to hand it to him. Secrets service took it from me and they handed it to him of course, and he looked at it. We had it all framed up and we had a bronze plaque put on with his name and everything, and the date then, he started touching the dots and he said, ""A Braille flag? "" and I said, ""Yeah,"" and he said, ""And they can see this?"" and I said, ""They can see it in full color, is what makes it so unique, because of their symbols on it in the designation."" So he dropped a little bit more and he has a very infectious smile and he said, ""Who would imagine more than 200 years of American history and American flag and our blind can see it too,"" and I asked him, ""Can I quote you on that?"" He said, ""Only figured accurately,"" and I said, ""Can I get a picture of you with it?"" Then the Secret Service guys said, ""You want to be in the picture?"" and I said, ""No, I just want a picture of the president with the braille flag,"" and so he took my camera, didn't do a very good job again to picture taken I mean, but I got the picture with them and and I asked him, ""Can I use your picture too?"" and he said, ""Only if you don't put a mustache on it."" So then I later contacted the White House and went out to DC for the celebrations of the installation of the Brown flag or LinkedIn, and then went to the White House and or rather to the state capital, and on the Senate side, they had a big Memorial Day celebration, and they included the Braille flag in that celebration. We brought blinded veterans and blinded civilians to it. They said it was the first time in history that they had a celebration that incorporated the blind civilians and soldiers. So that was special too.Heidi Christine Johnson: Can you describe the Braille flag a little bit?Randolph Cabral: Yeah. The Braille flag it's dimensionally about nine by seven inches, and that's a reason for that. Anytime you do tactile graphics, you have taken a consideration size. If you make it too big, somebody with a small hand would have difficulty discriminating it, if it's too small, somebody with the large end would have difficulty. So it's in full color, red, white, and blue. That was something that was done because sided people wanted to see it in full color. It has the 50 white stars, which are raised as should be in it as the 13 stripes. The white stripes are elevated and grainy, the red stripes are smooth, and that helps to discriminate the stripes at the far right of each stripe is a color symbol. This is unique to the blind, the blind are acquainted with it, but it lets them know also that this is a red stripe, this is a white stripe. Now down at the very bottom of the flag, and this is a requirement that's put out by the Braille Authority of North America. Anytime you do a tactile graphic, you have to include a key. So the key is right below [00:40:00] the flag itself, takes about an inch and a half, and it also educates the blind that the smooth is red, the raised grainy as white, and there's a small star there as well that lets them know that there were 50 whites stars on a blue field. One of the other things that we did or is done with the flag, is that we printed the Pledge of Allegiance onto the stripes, and then we also included the Pledge of Allegiance in Braille, and we did that because we encountered so many blind Americans who did not know the Pledge of Allegiance and really felt that any place the flag goes to pledge should go as well. So we incorporated the two. When we disseminate them and when we travel around the country and we give these out or we'd mail amount on requests, we send a full description, we put a braille alphabet card, which did self person does not know braille, sighted or blind. They can use this Braille alphabet card and they can discern everything that's on there in Braille, and whether they're closing their eyes and looking at it like a lot of teachers use in schools with their job, their students, sighted and blind, they too are able to learn, here is how the blind would see the American flag, and this is how they would read Braille, and this is where Braille looks like. So it gives them a little ideas to how the blind see things.Heidi Christine Johnson: What do you think your father would think about what you have done?Randolph Cabral: I think my dad would say, ""Good job, good job son"". Because those are the words he used a lot with any of us, when we excel on anything, he'd come over, put his hand on our shoulder, on our head and say good job. I think too my dad would probably, if he saw me and then he had he would say, ""You know, you've done one more thing to convince Americans that we are Americans. We don't leave anybody out,"" and I hope it does communicate that because that's what he instilled in me, probably even more than my siblings because I worked alongside my dad from the time I was nine, and every place he went, I went with him and he taught me to love this country. So I think he would see that in the Braille flag that I did not leave anybody out.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
MBY005906,"Sarah Culver: [00:00:00] Hi. Good morning. My name is Sarah Culver. I'm 24 years old. Today's date is October 31st, 2009. It's Halloween. I'm in Wichita, Kansas and I'm here with Larry, who I just met.Larry Garcia: Yes. My name is Larry Garcia, officially known as Lawrence D Garcia. I get that simply because of the various positions that I've held in local government here. But I've been invited to participate in this interview and I look forward to the questions and, hopefully, I can conjure up appropriate responses to everything that you ask.Sarah Culver: Great. Well, I definitely want to talk about your experience serving as a Fire Chief in Wichita for quite a while. But maybe we could rewind a little bit first and maybe you could tell me just a little bit about your childhood.Larry Garcia: Okay. I was born in 1936. So that makes me fairly old, comparatively old, in a very small farming community in Western Kansas. My father was a unclassified immigrant from Mexico and couldn't hardly speak English, and had a family of six boys, one girl. The girl was the oldest. Mother passed away when I was very young. So that was a turning point in my life because I was a little mama's boy, so to speak, at that point. I got everything I thought that I needed. She did everything she could in her limited part of the livelihood that we had with that such a large family. Then the work my father did, he was a railroad laborer. So that was great loss to me.Sarah Culver: How old were you when she passed?Larry Garcia: I was 14, and just on the verge of going into the upper level of schools. I was very active in sports and that kind of thing. She took care of me as long as I had good grades, and I did, as far as the equipment, shoes, and that kind of thing. I was the one that she focused on out of all the boys because they weren't sports-minded. The point is that it was a great loss to all of us. My sister was the oldest and was on the verge of moving because she had graduated that spring before her death. She had to take on the load of taking care of us guys and keeping us out of trouble because my father worked railroad labor and so he couldn't speak English very well. We helped him when he had to check into the immigration service, go to Kansas City and take his papers and make sure that he was still working at that kind of responsibility of a family and sticking to it. He certainly was very proud of being a citizen of this country.Sarah Culver: What was your relationship with your father like?Larry Garcia: It was certainly not what it was with my mother because he couldn't hardly speak English. Of course, he'd speak Spanish. I was one of six boys and I never did really learn how to speak all that well. So I had to defer to my sister or older brothers.Sarah Culver: Where were you in the in the line of [inaudible 00:04:12] ?Larry Garcia: Right was right in the middle of the pack of boys and, frankly, the only one of two of the boys that graduated. My sister graduated and she was the oldest. She was four years older than I am, almost five. So she took on our care.Sarah Culver: So what was that experience like? Because that seems unique to me that you couldn't communicate that well with your father, especially after having your mother pass and speaking different languages.Larry Garcia: I think that, because of the manner in which I conducted myself as far as my schooling, [00:05:00] at one point when you get to be 12, 13, 14, he would take one or the other of us to interpret for him to some degree. He had to maintain information with the immigration department. We'd go up to Kansas City, which is the region, whatever, and help decide for what was being asked of him and make sure that his papers were filled out appropriately. He spoke to us in Spanish and we responded in English. He could understand English fairly well and could read some. It was a self learn thing. He left Mexico when he was 12, 13 years old. It's really a bleak story when you think about it. A youngster that young walking away from home and finding himself all the way up into Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. He bragged about never being a hitchhiker, but he worked the railroads. That's where he started, got a job when he was 17 or 18 as a railroad laborer.Sarah Culver: So when he first came to the States, you said he went to Pittsburgh?Larry Garcia: Yes.Sarah Culver: Then how did he get to Kansas?Larry Garcia: Some word got out that they were building a railroad or extending a railroad in Santa Fe, the Santa Fe, Topeka. I'm saying it backwards, but it was a major railroad. So he found a way to get back here for work and met my mother.Sarah Culver: How did they meet?Larry Garcia: Her family was down in deep Texas. I can't remember exactly the name of the city or the town. But my grandfather was the patriarch of his whole family. He wanted to get his mother, and his sisters, and brothers and bring them to America. That's what he did. He settled in deep Texas. I can't remember the name of the city. Then worked the stoop labor that worked its way up into Kansas. In the Southwest portion of Kansas there was beat fields and that kind of thing. So that's where they found the jobs on the railroad because the railroad was being built through Western Kansas on into Topeka in Kansas City. He got work there and got away from that stooped labor that they were doing and settled in Kansas. Then, of course, my dad did the same thing that he did and met one of his daughters, and here I am. It's quite a story.Sarah Culver: Well, what was family like growing up? You had a lot of siblings. What types of things did you do for fun? What was your household like?Larry Garcia: It was pretty tight. A very small home was, the start of that was a railroad car, big railroad car that they moved off and they were doing a lot of things on a railroad. We lived very close to the railroad in the company housing that they provided for their laborers and my father wanted to get away from that. There was one of the farmers there that would take old railroad cars and make granaries out of them and he'd store their grain, their wheat, maize and other grain, rather than just dump it on the ground, which was a practice. They would put it in those abandoned railroad cars and unserviceable cars. He took a couple of those and put them together and built a real farm. He's very handy with both concrete and wood. So that was a very meager beginning and had a large family. He really instilled a lot of pride in us in terms of the fact that he was an American citizen, and then his Mexican upbringing was a thing that he was very proud of, and instilled some pride in us. We had the opportunity to go to Kansas City every year because he had to go there and check in with [00:10:00] the immigration service and that kind of thing. He wanted to make sure that he had somebody that understood what was being said. So when you became 12, 13, you could understand English fairly well, you could read well, you got your turn and go on to Kansas City with dad, seeing after him in terms of making sure that you got all the papers fixed.Sarah Culver: So you had to go to Kansas City once a year to check in?Larry Garcia: No, I think it was like every two years, three years. The simple thing was that apparently, we viewed it as you had to look him in the eye and tell him what you were doing in the paper. It wasn't every year, they would routinely pull the documents, and if they pulled your document then they would put the thing and get you up there. If you didn't respond in an appropriate way and make that appearance and do your testimony and all that, well, I don't know what the consequences of it was, but as I look back on it, I assume that they would just send you back to Mexico.Sarah Culver: The point of it was to prove that you are working?Larry Garcia: That you had a way to provide for yourself, you had family, and you had children that were born here in America that kind of thing. It seemed that that's what was keeping him here.Sarah Culver: So what was that like for you growing up? I mean, maybe, were you conscious at the time having this American identity and also having the Mexican identity?Larry Garcia: To the extent that we understood and recognized that he had to go to qualify himself if you will, to continue to live in the United States, we understood it to that extent. But to the extent that the consequences of if he didn't carry out all that administrative stuff as I look at it, that there would be some dire consequences on his part. Frankly, if he had to leave the family, well, then, it certainly would not bode well for us in terms of our care, and education and that kind of thing. It wasn't all that apparent at the time.Sarah Culver: So tell me about school. You said you played a lot of sports.Larry Garcia: The only boy of that family that graduated. My sister graduated when I was a freshman in high school. She graduated and the same that summer, mother passed away and she took on the care for us, just kept us together in terms of our schooling and that kind of thing and make lunches. We had neighbors that were just very loving and appreciated us as family so they played their part. It was a very small community, about 1,300 people out in Western Kansas. My mother found her way in at her family doing stoop labor from out of Texas all the way up into Hugoton. That's where my father met her and challenged my grandfather that he was worthy of her hand and so here I am.Sarah Culver: So what happened after graduating?Larry Garcia: I went into the Marine Corps. I was really working on not being a very good citizen.Sarah Culver: How so? What do you mean by that?Larry Garcia: Just chasing around with guys in that small town. Everybody knew us of course that whole County, running here and there chasing after girls who wanted to talk to us or we wanted to talk to. I won't go into any detail, but it was not a very good way to have any real future in it. But graduating was a good thing, and it made my father proud of us. I was the only boy out of six that graduated. My sister graduated four years before me.Sarah Culver: Did you have plans of what you wanted to be?Larry Garcia: Really, no.Sarah Culver: So how did you choose to join [00:15:00] the Marine Corps?Larry Garcia: My brother, one of my older brothers, there were two of them. Jerry went in and about nine months, nearly a year before I graduated. I was really impressed with his turnaround and all the spit and polish. It just made a man out of him and I was impressed with that, and so six months after I got out of school, I went in myself.Sarah Culver: So what was that experience like?Larry Garcia: It was a real turnaround in my life in terms of how I was acting, even though I kept my nose to the grinder during school so that I could play sports come summer and get a job, and just to have money, and keep an old clunker of a car running and that kind of thing, but I wasn't a very good citizen, chasing girls, that's enough said about that, but it just was not going anywhere. My father was very disappointed in my not wanting to go to college and he didn't have the money to send me and mother had passed away. So there was a number of things that drove us to make other plans for ourselves. It's like, you got to, you can't stay here because you're not working or whatever. We had summer jobs working in the harvest and that kind of thing, but when that all came to a halt, [inaudible 00:16:44] any money. So three of us joined the Marine Corps and it was the best thing for all three of us matter of fact in terms of.Sarah Culver: How long were you a part of the Marine Corps?Larry Garcia: Just four years. I went in four years and got out and came to Wichita. My sister had moved.Sarah Culver: What do you remember from those four years? What was that like?Larry Garcia: Initially, it was awfully strict. We came from a strict environment anyway at home, it wasn't brutal or anything, it just demanded respect for our elders and all that good stuff. I mean, a lot of children have that same thing, but my father saw to it that we respected my sister most particularly because of her willingness to stick with us and take care of us to the extent that she should or could in a very fragile time of our life. She did that, so we respected her in every way. But he saw fit to those of us who stayed in school to try to do things for us above and beyond what the rest of them were and there were four of them. Just immediately before my graduating, there were four of them that didn't graduate, almost one year frankly. That really disappointed him and he wasn't very pleasant about it. Two of us went into the Marine Corps and another four just did their thing and finally moved away from home and that kind of stuff. A small community, there's no jobs except in the summertime.Sarah Culver: So then what did you do when you came to Wichita?Larry Garcia: Goofed around and spent all my savings. I saved almost every penny I made when I was in the Marine Corps. I mean, the pay wasn't all that great, but I sent it home and put it in bank. When I got home, I went to St. Louis, stayed a couple of weeks at a time with St. Louis buddies. I still got a buddy there that we write and talk and send pictures of our family and all that stuff. Probably a friendship that I'll always cherish. Then there's a couple of them in Milwaukee, and Chicago, and down in Texas. I've kept track about three or four of them still today.Sarah Culver: So then how long was it? When did you start working for the fire department?Larry Garcia: I joined the fire department in June of '56.Sarah Culver: Was that pretty soon after coming to Wichita?Larry Garcia: That was, I got here in December, I believe or the year before and [00:20:00] just lived off my savings such as they were and pretty much mooched off my sister and finally she said, hey you're going to have to get a job and so I did and that was a fire department job June 1st of 57, 56. I can't remember exactly right.Sarah Culver: Tell me about working for the fire department.Larry Garcia: Well, the manner in which I was attracted to it was, I was coming downtown to where the federal building is on Main and 3rd and there was a fire station in the next block. City haul is there now but there was a fire station there and I was coming into the post office to take a letter clerk or male clerks test because I got extra points for my military service in that kind of thing. So I thought it would be a breeze for me and I was encouraged to, hey, look, it looks like you're okay and you can write and you can speak and all that kind of stuff. So anyway, I all but was offered a job, frankly by the person recruited me and so I can't. I was going to go take a test and got to Central in Washington. There was a lot of fire trucks coming right my face there and they all turned and went North on Washington and lot of black smoke, I mean, heavy smoke. I think it was at 3rd Street which would have been two or a long block South of Central, and so I turned after all those trucks got back. I mean, pulled up as close as I could where I could see where the fire was. There were a number of large two and a half story houses there and big porches around them. Anyway, I got out of the car and pulled over next to the curb and got out a car and walked up close, and we don't allow that anymore, but walked up very close and was just watching the operations and there were cars. Official fire cars come and park in various places. Anyway, there was this little old lady that was living in that house and the fire was in the back, on the back porch, a screened-in porch and there was a porch on the front side, and she was trying to get the screen. There's a little hook and she was trying to get that loose so she could get out and smoke was coming by or just blowing by. When she opened that door, well it did smoke just really just flew by her. She was coughing and spluttering a little bit, and so I could see her hands were shaking and so I thought that the shaking hands just prevented her from getting done what she was trying to do and that is where the little hook where. You know, she was trying to push up on. It was a very tight and so I went up on the porch and kick the screen and said, you know, stand back, I'm going to kick the screen. I'll reach up and try to push that thing loose and I did and she walked out of there. Well, all the smoke was rolling by, there wasn't any heat fortunately. The chief was standing across the corner. Big, tall, slender guy and handsome older man and news media people, newspaper guys and they talked to the lady and she apparently told him, you know, that young man over there helped me out of my house and blah. They were trying to make a big thing out of it. As I look back on it, she wasn't hurting and certainly was. If she just stayed in there, she probably would have had some respiratory stress with that smoke because it's pretty heavy. But anyway, I just walked her down to the sidewalk and told her that she could get sit down in my car or whatever and she didn't want to and said, my daughter's going to be here and so one of the fire officers came and when he saw the news media and you know, come gathering around me and ask questions and [00:25:00] I was making statements, that kind of stuff. The one of the officers came over and said that the chief wanted to seen me, and I said, ""Well, where is he at?"" and he said, ""That gentleman over there."" And so I went over and talked to him and I had my fatigue and they were really impressed and my shoes were spit shine. I mean, it was won of those things I just hadn't gotten out of the Marine Corps stuff and he was very impressed with my parents and my stature and whatever. So he asked me if I wanted to. I told him I was going to go and take a test and I said I'll just have to see if I can get in and that later date because I missed it standing over that fire going. He gave me his card and here I am.Sarah Culver: Was it when you saw the woman struggling with a lock, was it just first instinct to you to go help her or was it sorted of back and fourth?Larry Garcia: I think it was just instinct. Yeah, I tried to recall, I tried to holler at a couple of guys but they were watching the hose and engines they have to keep their eyes on. I learn now I known why they would stay where they were and take care of the business that they were responsible for, and that's pumping lines and making sure that they had pressure and all that kind of thing and so I just went on up there and kick the screen in. There wasn't any heat coming through there. There was a lot of smoke. I don't think at the time that I got there, except that the smoke was starting to cause her a little stress. She certainly wouldn't being threatened by any heat because there wasn't any.Sarah Culver: So how long did you work as a firefighter before becoming the Chief?Larry Garcia: I want to say eight years.Sarah Culver: So tell me about those eight years, were there some,Larry Garcia: It was a lot of fun.Sarah Culver: Memorable stories or?Larry Garcia: Yes, very. You know, the one thing that I think that I need to say is that the department was segregated at the time.They had a one station and had all the members of color, and I think that there wasn't any Hispanics except that in their maintenance shop that took care of the buildings and the fire trucks and that kind of stuff. There wasn't any Hispanics except him. Matter of fact, I think he passed away last week, but I'm trying to chase down and the name is appropriate, but I'm not sure that I'm, got the right guy, but we called him Joe, and he had just gotten out of the service himself. He was a Korean War veteran, and I was identified as same way, but I wasn't in there when the shoot was on, and so I didn't seen combat and he had, but getting to the point, the chief when we had our discussion and he new that I missed out on taking a test for a job while he reached in his pocket and said,""Hey, I'd like to be a firefighter. Take this down to City Hall, which is right here,"" just round the corner there was a city building at the time and go in and on the second floor. I think it was I can't remember for sure, and that's personnel and show him this card and tell him I said, we're not recruiting and we're not hiring write now. But you tell them I sent you, and on the back of that card I remember that he said possible fire recruit or something to that effect. So I gave him that card, I never did see that card, I wished I had it now, but that's I handed it to the person that greeted me at the personnel office, and so they said, ""Well, we don't know when we're going to be testing, but fill this thing out and we'll put you on the call list when they test,"" and so that's what they did. It was about oh, I don't know, I think about six weeks, because my sister was sick and tired of taking care of me, she really wasn't. But she was ready for me to get a job and get a place of my own. That kind of thing. And I was ready for [00:30:00] it too and here I am. So that was back in oh, wow, June of 56,57 I think, June of 57.Sarah Culver: So talk a little bit more that you said that the department was segregated.Larry Garcia: Segregated to the extent that any firefighter that was a sworn employee of color, they were all in one station. We had two shifts. We have three shifts now. They had two shifts and it was all African-American, and they were all at that one station. They were not assigned to any other station, and I worked 12 stations when I came on, there were 12 stations, there are like 22, 23, 24 now. But they all worked in one station, two shifts, and now there are three ships and the whole department is integrated to the extent that they...Sarah Culver: What were the differences between the two, between the stations for the people of color?Larry Garcia: At that time the difference was that they had just built a new station and these black fire, these African-American firefighters had moved in to that station, brand new station, 18th and market, two story, just beautiful and was state of the art at that time, and that's where they were. There were some people that I met, playing softball that had relatives that were firefighters and the firefighters, the black firefighters, had a softball team that was really exceptional, and so we played against them and they, there's camaraderie amongst the softball players and so I got to known a couple of them and won of them was the brother of a mortician here who still exists, and he said, ""Man, we can put it in a good word for you and probably get you at this station."" But that didn't happen. Chief, the assistant chiefs said, "" Hey, chief is going to break this segregation up, and you're going to be the point person, "" it went through a long line of discussions with both the chief and the assistant chief whose brainstorm was, that we're ready to desegregate our department.Sarah Culver: So you came in to the fire department, right as it was being desegregated, you being integrated?Larry Garcia: [inaudible 00:33:05] this didn't happen. I came on in 56, I believe June and I hate to say, but we can give you, June of 56 or 57, and it was segregated at that time, and they segregated it two years later, I think 59, oh it's in 59. Integrated. I'm sorry.Sarah Culver: What were they asking you to do? What was your role?Larry Garcia: Asking me to, I was taken in, went through six weeks training, eight weeks training, and assigned to an all white station.Sarah Culver: What was that like when that first integrated?Larry Garcia: Quite frankly, just coming out of the Marine Corps, and they were, had been for years integrated. The camaraderie was great. Supervisors have supervised. I'm talking about the rank even including the Commissioned Officers was integrated. I mean, so it was [inaudible 00:34:11] frankly, no one had a large organization like the Marine Corps. I had a lot of experiences, difficulty with people, people from all over the United States and some of them coming from states that were segregated in the had their lifestyles, their thought processes were much different than what little old Kansas boy would have experienced with, and so I thought it was a good fit. I think that's part of what the Chief at that time was looking at as well. Because rather than being assigned to this all black station, I don't know, maybe a month before [00:35:00] we graduated, I was called into the deputy chief, and he said, ""Now here's the plan. We're going to integrate and may not happen for a year or two, three, whatever, "" he said, ""Chief is going to be leaving here in another year or so, and so he wants to be around when we do this with you. We're going to assign you to an all white station, to district station,"" and there were three of them. I mean, no, the larger ones, and that's where the chief officers that were on duty on a given day would be housed. We had two shifts, 12 stations. They put me at station 2, which is just down here at Lewis in Topeka and that building is still there and-Sarah Culver: Did you ever face any discrimination?Larry Garcia: I'd tell you, there were people that had a terrible tongue. Coming out of the Marine Corps, I had a terrible tongue and it wasn't my upbringing. We were always treated like everybody else in my hometown and school, and we'd go and sleep overnight at guys' places, football player, basketball or whatever, and the same way they'd come to us and we'd go hunting in the winter and played on softball teams and all that stuff. So I had not experienced that kind of thing that we'd get in a city the size of Wichita, Kansas City, whatever. So it was foreign to me, but I was aware of it, acutely aware. There were two or three officers that I had initially that would use the ""N"" word and just be ugly with it. It wasn't directed at me by any means but, obviously, but there were the two shifts of black firefighters that they might be referring to in their jokes and that kind of stuff. But the guys that were at my level except for years in service, they just come out of the service in particular, were very supportive, very observant in terms of how, because we're a pretty transient department, if we had an officer that would be sick today, we'd call from another station and they would send one of their wannabes that had taken the test and did everything, he's just waiting for a promotion, that's the way they do this. They'd send him over there and let him take on that empty slot for that officer that was ill or whatever wouldn't be able to come to do. There were things that happened. On my shift, I never was treated ill in any way as it relates to race, but there were officers and some men that, in my presence, even would talk about some of the-Sarah Culver: Right.Larry Garcia: -firefighters that were black and say things about whatever.Sarah Culver: We're almost out of time and-Larry Garcia: Okay.Sarah Culver: -I was just wondering maybe you could talk just for the last couple of minutes. Just what the experience was like being the chief for 22 years? What did that mean to you? What impact did it have on your life?Larry Garcia: Well, obviously, it certainly met the highest goal that any firefighter would set for themselves, and I was fortunate to have been a part of this so-called integration, if you will. That was very meaningful, not so much, I couldn't grasp ever the reality of what was happening and the prospects of all kinds of things happening because of racial differences. But I didn't experience any of that except in just guys... you had beds that you were assigned to. On the opposite shift, there was somebody that was assigned to that same bed and we kept our own bedding. There would be times when the guy opposite of me would use my pillow, [00:40:00] because I'd left it on the stool or whatever that was next to our bed, and he just used that pillow because it was a big, nice, big, old, fluffy pillow and then he used it, and I could see that, I mean, they'd go out on fires, you get all that smoke and there's a lot of times you just didn't get it all from behind your ears or whatever, or maybe there'll be some soot on the back of your hair but I would know that somebody used my pillow. So I would question him about it. There were a couple of guys that really took exception to that. Now, whether it was racial or not, I don't know. I didn't anticipate that it was and so I didn't react to it as if it was. The discussions that came about never alluded to any racial kinds of differences or anything like that. I didn't experience it. I'm very fortunate, really very fortunate not to have gone through that because two years later, two-and-a-half, maybe three years in '59 when we segregated, I'd been called in and said hey, here's part of what we hired you for and that's why you went to that station. You didn't get that new one and you've done a great job and you're well-liked and went just on and on and on. Of course, building me up for this thing in terms of what he was ready to do and that is to desegregate. We had right at two years of my experience and making that happen. But there's a difference between Hispanics and African-American and it was vividly manifested when that segregation took place because there were some that just couldn't work with that in their mind. There was discussion when that thing went down and they planned it all out. I had meetings with the chief and shared with him a number of my experiences as I listened and watched and wrestled with what I saw was going on and what I felt about some of the comments that would be made. Particularly when they said, hey, we're gonna do this.Sarah Culver: RightLarry Garcia: There were some changes that took place, but it wasn't drastic. It wasn't embarrassing to me except that here's a guy that I thought the world of and he treated me like I was a brother. That would express his-self the way that they did. He never demonstrated or manifested any kind of feeling that way. It was maybe and that would have been '59, after about two whole years that I'd worked with him. That was very disconcerting, I guess-.Sarah Culver: Right.Larry Garcia: -probably is old.Sarah Culver: Well, we're about out of time, but it's been a pleasure speaking with you and hearing about your experiences working for the fire department here in Wichita.Larry Garcia: I appreciate the opportunity.Sarah Culver: Thank you.Larry Garcia: Sure.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
MBY006024,"Christie Astrada: [00:00:00] My name is Christie Astrada. I'm 13. Today is December 5th, 2009. I'm in Houston, Texas and this is my teacher.Veronica Stark: My name is Veronica Stark. I'm 35. Today is December 5th, 2009. Our location is Houston, Texas. My relationship to Christie is she is a former student. Hello, Christie.Christie Astrada: How did you get involved in teaching?Veronica Stark: Well that happened, let's see, in 1999, I was working for Latina Magazine in New York, right down in Times Square. The magazine industry took a nosedive when I had just moved from the advertising department to the editorial department and I got to write a few articles. Then all of a sudden our company changed hands and they released a few of us from our jobs. It was a very sad moment in my life because I thought I was just starting anew, but I probably was out of work. I would say at least three or four months and then my mom and I were having one of those life changing conversations about what should be my next step. She said, ""You should try teaching, I think you would enjoy it and then somewhere down the line, when you have children, you can have the summers off with your kids."" The next fall was 2001? No, when did September 11 happen. Was it 2001?Christie Astrada: I think it was.Veronica Stark: Yes, yes. That was the very first year I started teaching in a school in Newark, New Jersey and I really loved the school. That was a great opportunity and that's why I've been teaching ever since I had such a great opportunity and experience, and I'm so glad my mom suggested it to me.Christie Astrada: How do you move from New Jersey all the way down to Houston, Texas?Veronica Stark: Well, after September 11th, my then fiance at the time decided that we were looking to start a family and we were about to get married and we decided that we wanted to be really far from where the devastation happened. There was an opportunity with his company, JPMorgan Chase, that had him starting a new technology office with a few others and that's the story. I mean, we just knew that after something like that horrific tragedy, we wanted to just start fresh somewhere else and away from New York City. I've enjoyed it ever since, especially when I've had such wonderful students like yourself, Christie, I couldn't have asked for a more charming student.Christie Astrada: Thank you.Veronica Stark: You're welcome.Christie Astrada: I consider myself very charming.Veronica Stark: You are.Christie Astrada: Thank you.MALE_1: Can I actually ask one quick question?Veronica Stark: Yeah.MALE_1: What did you do in those three to four months? How did you feel when you got laid off? What was that like for you?Veronica Stark: It was really emotional for me. I knew that it was hard to find a job and I even did find another job in a magazine spot, in an editorial spot. Then as soon as I got that job, that magazine folded. It was like a teen Hispanic magazine and I can't even remember the name of it, but it also folded like many other magazines that were new and breakthrough at the time. I just remember calling my mom a lot and I recall that I saved up all my unemployment money and got myself a laptop, so that I could just be entertained while I was at home. But it was hard, it was hard. That's why I'd have these like, life-changing conversations with my mom. I'm like, what do I do? I've been interviewing. I was interviewing all over New York City for different opportunities in the editorial teams of InStyle Magazine I had an interview at. I went to a couple of other small interviews with book publishing industry, just helping book like Random House, I think I had an interview at and nothing was coming to fruition. That's where I was at rock bottom. I just called my mom up one day and I said, ""I don't know what to do."" She said, ""Well, try substituting."" I enjoyed working with students with substituting, and that's what started me going. It just so happened that this academy I found with monster.com. I noticed that there was a teaching job at this small academy in Newark, New Jersey. [00:05:00] It was perfect. I had a small group of 15 students. It was a private school and I loved it. It was a group of fourth graders and I believe that they graduated last year if I'm not mistaken. What do you want to do, Christie, as far as you are not too far away from graduation, you have, four years seems like a long time, but it goes by quick. What are your plans?Christie Astrada: Well, I was planning to try to see if I could get a scholarship at Texas A&M to become a vet and I at least want to get it like I want to go to school year round instead of just taking the summers off and see if I can finish my six years in at least four.Veronica Stark: That's wonderful. That's wonderful. I find that there'll be no doubt that you'll do that, Christie, because you seem to do everything with a gusto when I see you walking around the school. You've always got a smile on your face and you're always in the best of moods. That was one thing I really enjoyed when you were in my class, that you would always make me smile.Christie Astrada: Can't take life too seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyways.Veronica Stark: Exactly. Yeah. There's going to be a few cuts and bruises as we go along.Christie Astrada: How did you become interested in teaching Texas history?Veronica Stark: Well, I went to the University of Wisconsin and one of my minors was history. I've always just loved stories and reading and finding out about different cultures. It just seemed like a perfect match. My mom taught history and said that that was a really exciting subject. Currently, my brother, who is five years younger than myself, is also a history teacher. He teaches high school in Wisconsin, and it's just a long line of teachers. My mother's sister is also a teacher and I think it's just in our blood. Would you ever consider teaching if it...?Christie Astrada: No, I'm not patient enough to teach kids stuff. I can barely teach Knock to do certain things in writing.Veronica Stark: I think you'd probably be pretty good at it. You're very...  I think you're patient, I think you're patient.Christie Astrada: I don't consider myself very patient at all.Veronica Stark: No?Christie Astrada: No.Veronica Stark: Well, you might consider it down the line maybe.Christie Astrada: If you're lucky, if you're lucky.Veronica Stark: If I'm lucky, then you can come back to me and say, I guess it isn't that bad.MALE_1: Christie, do you think that's one of the main characteristics you need to be a teacher?Christie Astrada: Yes, actually, because everybody doesn't work at the same pace as other people. Some people are less quick and others are, they catch on pretty fast. I would want everybody to go at the same pace instead of just having to take it one by one.Veronica Stark: Right. Well, veterinary school is something that I considered myself but I'm just not that I remember, that was my dream. That's when I went to the University of Wisconsin, I know they had a really great veterinary school, but I just was wimpy when it came to seeing animals in bad situations, for example, if a bird hit a window. I just didn't have the stomach. I think that people would bring their pets into me and I'd be crying along with them. I don't think that would be very successful to have as a quality as a vet. A crying veterinarian might be rough. Well, what are some other things that you might consider doing, if you change your mind, is there any, I know you are very passionate with a lot of different things that you do. What else would you consider doing?Christie Astrada: Well, my mom was a nurse and my brother is a doctor. That's something else I'm interested in helping people with their medical problems. Because it's cool because my brother bring along his medical books and I just flip through it and see all the different stuff that can go wrong.Veronica Stark: Right.Christie Astrada: It's something I want to get into, like helping find cures for stuff like cancer and leukemia and stuff like that.Veronica Stark: I can see you being involved in that kind of work. I don't know. The first day you walked into my room, I knew that you were a sparkling personality. I just was so glad to have you in my class.Christie Astrada: Your class was fun. I got to work a lot on history fair, which I've never really done before. I've done history projects but never gone on to like district and regionals.Veronica Stark: Yeah.Christie Astrada: It was a new experience and it was really cool to see what goes on.Veronica Stark: Behind the scenes.Christie Astrada: Behind the scenes, yeah.Veronica Stark: Yeah.Christie Astrada: It was cool to work on a technology project for a while.Veronica Stark: Yeah. I was excited to start seeing some students move on. I think previous to your class, there was not very many of my students were moving on and I was thinking to myself, was it me? Did I not inspire [00:10:00] them enough, but I just think it takes a lot of work and you and Knock put a lot of work into it. I'm just so glad you guys got to move on. It was just so hard for us at the end when we found out we weren't moving on to state. I know you guys were brokenhearted, but I know that --Christie Astrada: We were so close.Veronica Stark: You were so close.Christie Astrada: Third place.Veronica Stark: Yes, but then that just made you work even harder this year.Christie Astrada: I wanted it so bad to go on to state. This year we're going to try to make it.Veronica Stark: Yes.Christie Astrada: That's our goal is state.Veronica Stark: Yeah.Christie Astrada: Not nationals, but just state.Veronica Stark: Yeah, exactly. I believe that every student that's gone from our school has had a fabulous time. It's just a neat experience when you really put your heart into a project like that. It's such a great opportunity to see what competition is out there across the state of Texas because we are such a huge state that does participate in history fair.Christie Astrada: I know whenever I got third place, I was devastated. I didn't even want to go up there and get the medal. They were like, ""Oh, you got third."" And I was like, ""Ugh."" Because it was so hard, working on it for weeks and weeks and then just hearing that devastation was like, ""Oh my God, are you serious?""Veronica Stark: Yes and every year I deal with that because my kids always go pretty far these past couple of years and then just to see the look in their eyes when they find out they're third. That happened with Justin too and it was tough. He was really brokenhearted.Christie Astrada: Yes. So this year our goal is to make it to state and if we're lucky enough, we'll go to nationals, but we're not too worried about that right now. What do you think about this year's topic?Veronica Stark: Innovators and innovation, I thought it was kind of an exciting topic because we've had a lot of revolutionary, innovative people, with Martin Luther King and Che Guevara, and even now with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, there's just so many people that are marking milestones lately. It was kind of a fun topic because I think the last couple of topics they were pick one side or another, this was just find an innovative invention or an innovative thinker, and I thought you guys had a really great topic. How about you?Christie Astrada: Our topic for this year or last year?Veronica Stark: Well, in general, how did you feel about the...?Christie Astrada: I liked topic this year a lot more than I did last year's because it actually expanded how many things you could pick. You could do, let me see, like fingerprints and you could focus on the forensic development as well. So you could ad-lib to your project along with your main topic.Veronica Stark: Exactly. Yeah. That one really caught my eye too. I like that project. Like you say, you could run with the project. Innovation has been since man first stepped on the Earth, so you really did have a wide array of things to choose from.Christie Astrada: Yes and they added a new section, websites. What did you think about that?Veronica Stark: I was a little nervous about the websites, but I actually think that it might be the way to go because there's a lot less people in that particular arena. So I think that it would just have been easier for someone to just take it right to state because of less competitions. Everyone seems to love boards or the idea of boards and everyone wants to do that exhibit. Then when they finally turn it in and I see them, I just think, well, maybe you should have done a website because you probably could have gotten your point across maybe a little easier than just finding pictures.Christie Astrada: Just printing out papers and stuff.Veronica Stark: Exactly. Pulling things from Wikipedia.Christie Astrada: That's why it's a lot harder to do a website or a PowerPoint presentation, because it's not just like printing out little pieces of paper. You have to actually do the research. You have to try to find facts that are true to put in it. Then you have to record your voices if you're doing a PowerPoint presentation and you have to make sure you information sounds good and it makes sense and then you have to match the pictures with what you're saying. It takes a really long time just to create a little PowerPoint that's maybe three minutes long.Veronica Stark: I know. It does take a lot of effort. Yeah. That's one great thing about Stovall is that we do participate in history fair because some of the districts around us don't and somewhere down the line, if I end up moving to another district, if they don't have history fair, I don't know what I'll do as the big history buff that I consider myself.Christie Astrada: Actually, last year we did it and I really liked it because [00:15:00] it was a lot of fun and I get to hang out with my friend and we got to do this cool project and stuff. Then this year I was so excited because I wanted to move on to state. I know I'm going to be obsessed with doing it until I actually get there.Veronica Stark: Yes. Like I said, you've got some time ahead of you, so if it doesn't work out this year, you've got a few more years, and then you're off to college. That's like a whole year of history fair. A lot of research. You'll be researching in a lot of different subjects.Christie Astrada: Did you teach any other subjects while you were a teacher?Veronica Stark: I did. I have taught kindergarten which was wonderful because once you teach a child how to read, it's wow, it's an amazing feeling. This little girl I had one year, her name was Jacqueline. She was the sweetest little thing in the world. I was reading to her at the table and she was reading along with me and she was just staring at me, so I am thinking all along, ""Oh, she's just listening and she's having a good time hearing the story, "" and she just stopped me like the little Southern belle that she was and she tapped my shoulder and she whispered into my ear, ""You're just such a beautiful teacher."" That is just one moment that I think got me hooked. She was such a great student and I knew that if I could make a difference and teach someone how to read, that educating students was just my cup of tea.MALE_1: Do you remember your first classroom ever like your first day as a teacher?Veronica Stark: Yes. Oh, yeah. It was it was scary because like I said, I was in a totally different field and it felt like the first day of school for me literally. I had all these little kids just waiting on anything that I was going to say. It was a self-contained class, so I saw these kids all day. I pretty much taught them every subject. It was interesting. I remember the room. I remember that our school was right by a little park in Newark and we would just take the kids out to the park. We didn't have a really big school, so there's a little park right in front of the school and the kids ran around this public park and you have people feeding the squirrels in the park and trying to keep the kids out of the street. It was interesting, but another time that I had a really great time my first year was taking my students across to a museum where they had this really big courtyard and reading that book to them, ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" and thinking to myself, this is kind of a sad book and it's above their reading level, but I tell you what, those kids were just so interested in that story because they were so far removed. They were inner city children and just hearing about this little country boy mail-ordering dogs, they loved it. That still to this day is my favorite movie -- or my favorite book. Yeah.MALE_1: What grade were the kids through your first class?Veronica Stark: The first group of kids I had were fourth graders. Yeah. They were 15 little fourth graders and they were just amazing. I recall at the end of the year, it was just great to be near them. We went on a camping trip somewhere in the mountains in New York, I believe. We got on a bus with them and went on this trip and it was called... I can't even remember what the name of the place was, but it was this beautiful camping ground in the mountains and a lot of their parents came and my husband. I encouraged him to be a chaperone with the little boys and it was just so funny. He said, at night when they were all trying to sleep in this little cabin on all these little bunk beds, they were just giggling and they just had such a great time. We took so many pictures and they just were so full of energy. These little city kids just being out in the mountain air. It was a trip I will never forget. Frost Valley. That's what's the name of the area that we went to, was called Frost Valley. So we had a great time and the kids were doing all sorts of icebreaker type games and trust fall and going through a web with a group of 15 without touching the ropes and falling back into somebody's arms. It was really a fun time and then having their dads with them when their dads normally worked full time and just being with the kids and their fathers and the moms. It was just so neat to be in nature with these kids because they just didn't get out to nature that often, well, in the city park, but that was pretty much it.Christie Astrada: Do you think you would like to do that with some of the kids from our school?Veronica Stark: Oh my goodness. Taking a trip with middle school students. [00:20:00] Yeah. I recall when I took a trip as a seventh grader and we went camping in a bat cave. I don't remember what part of Wisconsin, but it was really great experience. We went spelunking and traveled throughout the cave, crawling through tunnels and whatnot, but I can only imagine what kind of craziness would go on if I tried to bring some of our students into a cave where it was cool. We got to sleep overnight. I just don't know that the kids these days, they've changed since I was seventh grader. I mean, they're fun and very vivacious and really excitable, but I don't know. Some of the kids probably might be lost if we couldn't get a cellphone signal.Christie Astrada: I have a very bad sense of direction, so I would probably get lost without my cellphone.Veronica Stark: I know me too. I just use it all the time even when you called me if I was on my way earlier, I was like, okay, well, this is what you need to do, just exact directions. I'm so glad that they came out with that navigation system on phones because I would be lost. I kind of laugh because I do teach geography with my husband. I recall when I used to live in New York, I'd call him and I'd be in the city and you have these big, towering buildings all around you and you're like the size of an ant. I'd be calling him, he'd be in the middle of a meeting or I'd call them like three or four times and he'd say, ""What do you need and okay, get on MapQuest. I'm here located between this street and this street,"" I mean, I don't know. They say women and directions, it's always been something that's hard for people, but I don't know. Sometimes I can't find my way out of a paper bag, but thank God for my GPS and my phone because I maybe I wouldn't be here right now.Christie Astrada: So you think it's not only kids that have been like becoming more dependent on technology, but it's like adults too.Veronica Stark: Exactly. I think the whole thing of being in a big city and you don't know your way around, it can be kind of scary. Even at my age now, just being somewhere and not knowing my surroundings. It's interesting, but yeah, I do rely on my phone quite a bit. I'll be somewhere and even as I was coming in, I took a wrong turn, but luckily, I edited wherever I was, and it got me to the right spot. So I think, yeah, I think definitely because when I was in seventh grade, I can't even imagine what it would have been like with a cell phone and texting and oh, my goodness.Christie Astrada: Having to go through metal detectors every morning.Veronica Stark: Yeah. I don't know that. Yeah, we didn't have metal detectors that's for sure. But I was in the inner city too, so it is weird to see how time has changed.Christie Astrada: But after a while you get used to it, like, ""Okay, I'm coming in through the bus ramp, I've got to open my backpack and ready for them to search me.""Veronica Stark: Yeah.Christie Astrada: Then you walk through metal detector, and even if it goes off, they have to pull out the little wand, and they got to search you.Veronica Stark: Well, this is a question for you. Do you feel safe at our school? You do go through the metal detectors, so technically, you should feel really safe.Christie Astrada: Well, it depends on the situation. It depends on the kind of person I'm with. If I'm around a more daring person, I wouldn't feel as safe as if I'm with a more quiet and nervous person because it's dangerous.Veronica Stark: There is danger lurking around most schools, I would say in big cities. But I think that we're a pretty secure school.Christie Astrada: We don't have really good metal detectors either. I could sneak my cell phone in and walk through the metal detectors at the same time.Veronica Stark: Yeah.Christie Astrada: If I don't want to stick it in my backpack, I'll just stick it in my pocket and the metal detectors won't go off.Veronica Stark: Yes, sometimes cell phones don't go off. But the only reason we have that rule is so that you guys are not texting while you should be --Christie Astrada: Totally focused on what you're teaching.Veronica Stark: Exactly. I know that even without phones, there are many students that cannot keep on task. So I can only imagine what it would be like if we could have cell phones in the classroom.Christie Astrada: Yeah, that would be atrocious.Veronica Stark: Especially during testing week. My goodness, I can just see all of a sudden, everyone texting, ""What did you get for number...?""Christie Astrada: That's never happened. I've never actually known anybody to text on testing days.Veronica Stark: Yeah. But on testing days. You do text maybe then regular days, which are more than testing days.Christie Astrada: We are not that bad.Veronica Stark: That's true. I haven't really ever caught anyone texting. I have caught phones going off, but I usually do what I have to do and take them away. Of course, then I have a student that's mad at me for about 24 hours [00:25:00] and they'll get over it.MALE_1: I'm really curious about how you two first met. You had mentioned about seeing Christie for the first time. But what do you remember about seeing Veronica for the first time?Christie Astrada: I remember walking in and thinking she was going to speak half in Spanish, half in English, and I was not going to understand anything, and I was going to fail all her assignments, and I was freaking out. Then she came and she was like, ""Hi. I'm Ms. Stark,"" and I was like, ""Thank God.""MALE_1: Why did you think that?Christie Astrada: Because of her skin tone, the way she looks.Veronica Stark: I get that all the time. I go to places and they're just expecting me -- they're talking to me in Spanish and I'm just like, ""Can you help me? Hablas Ingles?"" I always surprise people, especially when the parents come in and they're like, tell me all about my son, and I can understand pretty well. We talked about that earlier this morning, I can understand pretty well. But then when it comes to responding, I feel more comfortable in English. Either we need a translator or I always look to the kid and say, tell your mother this. But most of the time, I can get my way through Spanglish pretty okay.MALE_1: What grade were you in?Christie Astrada: Seventh grade, I was in the seventh grade. It was a brand new school to me and it was two stories, so I was freaking out because I have a bad directional sense. Yeah. It was a lot of fun though. I had a lot of fun in seventh grade, especially in your class because of history fair.Veronica Stark: Yeah. Well, that's good to know, that you had fun.Christie Astrada: Then we got to watch a lot of movies about San Antonio and stuff like that.Veronica Stark: Texas history, the Alamo. Yeah.Christie Astrada: We don't get to do that in US History, not at all.Veronica Stark: Really? Well, you will.Christie Astrada: It's all PowerPoints and notes. By the end of the class, my hand is cramping.Veronica Stark: Get ready for college because that's what it's like. Well, it seems like though when I see people on, say, 60 Minutes or the news, I see a lot of people with laptops in college.Christie Astrada: Yeah.Veronica Stark: They're just typing away, typing away, and that seems so cool because I never ever learned how to type, ever. Because my elective, I only took orchestra, so I never had time to learn how to type. So sometimes when teachers or students are behind me and I'm at my computer, and I'm pecking away, they're like, ""You don't know how to type, do you?"" Well, not really.Christie Astrada: That's what happened last year. We were trying to get our forms in for history day and you were just typing so slow, it was like one word per minute, and it was like, ""Oh my God, Ms. Stark, move."" We had to take over and it was like, phew, finished.Veronica Stark: Yes.Christie Astrada: So it's really nice to know how to type because it opens up a lot of job opportunities.Veronica Stark: That is true. But I seem to have done okay faking my way through. So how are you going to feel at the end of May? Are you going to be sad? Are you going to be excited?Christie Astrada: I don't want to leave Stovall. I like that school. It's like homey. Everybody knows everybody and everybody knows what's happening with all the teachers. You see one of your teachers in the hallway, hi.Veronica Stark: Right.Christie Astrada: It's really cool to be in that school and it's two stories. So if you want to go see your old teachers, you know where to find them, they're upstairs.Veronica Stark: Right.Christie Astrada: It's really nice. I'm worried about going to the Ninth Grade Center next year.Veronica Stark: Well, with every year that you age, especially when you're going on to high school, there's always so many responsibilities. You need to cherish your next few years and just know that you just try your best, do the best that you can, work hard, because life only gets tougher. As I sit here, and I have car payments and a mortgage, you just look back to your high school years and say, ""Wow, I just had it easy back then.""Christie Astrada: But lately, I've been worried because my parents have been telling now colleges looking at your eighth grade year and I'm like, ""Oh my God, I don't want them to see all my failing grades, no."" So lately, I've been trying to work as hard as I can, concentrating on school, not on any after-school activities.Veronica Stark: Well, that's good. That's good.Christie Astrada: Yeah.Veronica Stark: I think you'll do fine, Christie. You're a hard worker. I do recall that you give everything your all, even if it's not so thrilling. I remember those vocabulary cards I used to make you guys do.Christie Astrada: Yeah, I hated those.Veronica Stark: But you guys always did so well on the exams. I think they they worked for me.Christie Astrada: I fell asleep during one of the exams. I was like on question 40 and everybody was on like question 10. I was like, ""You know what? I'm just going to take a little nap."" I went to sleep [00:30:00] and when I woke up it was like five minutes before school was over and I was like, ""Oh, no."" Everybody was still on question 30 and I was, ""Yes, thank you so much.""Veronica Stark: Yeah. Wow. You must have been feeling sick that day.Christie Astrada: No, I was just tired.Veronica Stark: Yeah. Well, this has been a lot of fun, Christie. It's been nice to spend the day chatting with you, especially about school. I thought maybe we would talk about a few other things. But I think we're school girls for the rest of our days, always learning.Christie Astrada: I loved school actually. People are like, oh, my God, I have to get up early in the morning and it's like, stop complaining. You know you love it.Veronica Stark: I know. Well, the funniest thing is I have children that always e-mail me, even when we're on vacation. I had one little boy. I think it was Saturday morning. I got an e-mail from a student just saying, how is everything? I'm like, okay. We're on vacation now and you're e-mailing your teacher. Is there something wrong with this picture? You all look forward to it and then I've got someone who's like, how are you doing? I said I just saw you yesterday.Christie Astrada: But the entire Christmas vacation, we have nothing to do. Like, okay, Christmas day, yes. Presents but we opened them the first day and we're like, yeah, this is cool. Then the next day, we're all bored. It's like, what do we do for the next couple of days? So we get on the computer and we find our teachers on MySpace or Facebook, and we start e-mailing them and chatting with them. So it's really cool to see what teachers do whenever they're not at school.Veronica Stark: I know. I remember when I was working with the little kids, it was so weird to see them out in public because they thought I lived at the school and what was I doing in jeans. It's always interesting to run into your -- even I had one little girl last year who said to me, I saw you at the mall, but I ran into a store because I just didn't know what to do. That was a seventh grader. I was like, ""well, if I see guys out, I'll say hi.""Christie Astrada: It's weird to see your teachers in public.Veronica Stark: It is weird. Don't be afraid to say hello though. We're people too.Christie Astrada: We think outside of school, you guys have no lives.Veronica Stark: If you only knew, sweetie. If you only knew.Christie Astrada: We know you have family and stuff, but we think that after you leave school, you're basically like nobody. You're just a person in the background. That's how we think about it. Then we'll see you in public with your families and we are like, ""oh my God, what do we do?"" Then we panic and we hide.Veronica Stark: Yeah, that's what I think happens. There's that moment of panic.Christie Astrada: If it's your current teacher, it's a lot weirder than if it's your past teacher, because it's your current teacher, you have to see that person maybe the next day or two days from then.Veronica Stark: Right. Well, I do recall being in the grocery store with my mother and I think she taught for 33 years. But while I was in the same school district as her, everywhere we went, every time we turned a corner, either with someone that was a co-worker or a student at the grocery store, and they'd hold us up, talking and talking. It was usually parents that were talking and talking, but the kids would look at me like, ""oh my goodness, she has children?"" It's always so funny.Christie Astrada: Yeah, it is. Because usually, you see teachers and they're in work uniforms and with their ID badge. Then you see them outside of school and they're in jeans or in a dress or something. It's like, ""oh my God, you have normal clothes.""Veronica Stark: Yes. Then I'll see you guys outside on the street 10 minutes after school is over and you're wearing the jeans you want to wear, you got your iPod on, and you've got your little fancy shirts on, and stuff you cannot wear to school. But it's interesting to see you guys on open house nights.Christie Astrada: Yeah, because we all go home and change, and we bring our technology with us. But sometimes none of us go home. We just have our stuff with us. We'll wear pants or shorts underneath our uniform clothes just to slip them off later.Veronica Stark: It's always what I hear when I catch someone out of their dress code. ""I've got stuff in my backpack."" ""Go put it on.""Christie Astrada: Yeah.MALE_1: Christie, I'm curious, what's a typical day of your eighth year? What does a teenager in school do?Christie Astrada: Well, I'm in media product, which means I do the announcements in the morning and we're on this little TV thing and it's called KSMS, which I don't know what the K stands for, but SMS stands for Stovall Middle School. We do the announcements in the morning, which is like the word of the day or the vocabulary, and announcements for teachers and students alike, and maybe words of wisdom.Veronica Stark: I always love the words of wisdom. Meanwhile, the kids are talking and I'm trying to hush them up.Christie Astrada: The words of wisdom. After a while, you start to memorize them because we have this little book full of them. If you are bored in media product, you would just flip through the book and be like, this is nice words of wisdom.Veronica Stark: We'll use that tomorrow.Christie Astrada: Yeah. Then it'll like, this is for [00:35:00] Wednesdays, Thursdays, and then after media product, I go to first period because as soon as we finish doing announcements is time for everybody to get to first period, and I have to walk all the way to a different hallway, down to the end of it, and then all the way back for second period. Then for third period, I go not too far from my second period class and then I have lunch, which I don't really eat lunch at school because I don't really like it that much. The rest of the day is pretty much a drag.Veronica Stark: It's downhill. That just makes me feel even better when I have kids at the end of the day, that's probably what they're thinking. ""Oh, goodness, now I have to go to history class.""Christie Astrada: Because we're so exhausted.Veronica Stark: I can tell at the end of the day when you all are tired.Christie Astrada: Because I had you for last period last year and every time, I was exhausted.Veronica Stark: We had fun though making foldables or doing that play. You guys loved that play.Christie Astrada: I was awesome. I kicked butt as a pirate.Veronica Stark: Yes, you was Jean Lafitte, a Texas history person.Christie Astrada: Arg.Veronica Stark: Yeah. I remember for a while, you were saying ""arg"" with your little hooked finger.Christie Astrada: It was really fun. I liked last year. Last year was a breeze. This year, it's so much stress because I have a lot more tests. So hopefully, I pass.Veronica Stark: You'll do fine. I have no worries for you.Christie Astrada: This was fun.Veronica Stark: It was fun.Christie Astrada: Great experience.Veronica Stark: It was. I'm glad that you could make it on a Saturday. I was thinking, ""I'm going to go hang out with the student"" and then I thought, ""well, at least it's Christie."" I thought for a moment it'd be like school, but no, it's been a really nice time. It's like we're at a coffee shop or something. It's great.Christie Astrada: Yeah. I don't like to have a negative attitude. It's not good.Veronica Stark: Yeah. I thought you would enjoy this. You are in broadcast, so I figured, this would be cool to do. I hear the stories on the radio as I drive home from work and it is just neat to hear a little snippet of people's lives. It's like you're eavesdropping.Christie Astrada: Yes. This would be a great experience to tell my kids or if I have become a teacher, maybe my students would be like, ""I did this. I'm in the National Library of Congress.""Veronica Stark: You can use me as a primary resource.Christie Astrada: Right here. This is cool.Veronica Stark: Cool.MALE_1: I do have one final question. How has your life been different as far as how you pictured it before since you were in advertising and magazine? Can you reflect on that?Veronica Stark: Yeah. My life hasn't changed. I've always just rolled with the punches. It was a dark moment for me when I did lose my job in that field because I really was loving my opportunities to write for a magazine, especially Latino magazine. It was great to be with people that shared the same cultures with me. I have that now at school with a lot of the Mexican American students I work with, a lot of the South American students that I work with, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Maybe someday when my daughters are older, I would write children's stories because it seems like -- I'm in the book club at Stovall Middle and kids eat up books. They love to read. So I think maybe I would become, down the road, an author of some junior high books because I just loved to read and I don't think I would have it any other way. It's fun and it's nice to be able to spend the time with my family during the summer. It's nice to be with my daughters. But every year, I get a whole new 150 crop of kids. Every year, the eighth graders ask me, how were your kids this semester? Are they different? Are they meaner? Are they worse? I just told Christie today, they're always the same, just different faces and different antics. A day in the life of a Stovall Middle School student. There's always some fun in the day, something crazy going on.Christie Astrada: Yeah. Your class was fun last year. A lot of laughs and a lot of learning.Veronica Stark: Yeah. I like to make my history class fun and then by the whole second semester, you guys are just new, older, little kid. I just love it. You guys think you're all adult, but you're just still little kids in my eyes and I love it to see your growth. It's great.Christie Astrada: Awesome.Veronica Stark: Yeah.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
MBY006030,"Lucinda Garces:	[00:00:00] My name is Lucinda Garces. I am 40 years old. Today's date is December the 8th, 2009. We are at Houston, Texas and the person I'm with today is my mother.Mary J. Garces:	My name is Mary J. Garces. I am 75 years old. Today's date is December the 8th, 2009, located in Houston, Texas. My partner is my daughter.Lucinda Garces:	The first question I have for you, mom, in reference to this project is, why did your family immigrate from Mexico?Mary J. Garces:	My grandparents came across from Mexico because it was during the revolution, Pancho Villa revolution. So, everybody -- So many people were leaving at that time. Yes.Lucinda Garces:	How did they -- How did they travel?Mary J. Garces:	Okay. They could have come by train because it was very inexpensive to come by train. But so many ugly things were happening on the train, so my grandfather decided they were going to cross the river. And they had my mother and my uncle. And that's the reason they came. They swam across. But later, not too much later, they had their paperwork done.Lucinda Garces:	How how old was -- How old was your mother when she came?Mary J. Garces:	She was two years old.Lucinda Garces:	And what was the philosophy of the family once they arrived?Mary J. Garces:	Well, since my grandfather's money was stolen when he -- after he crossed the border, so he had to start from scratch. He worked hard, a lot of times cleaning brush, moving on a farm to work, do farm work. And then he started selling off of his truck, fruit, food, clothing, because all the Becerra's are business people. And he succeeded. He did very well.Lucinda Garces:	And that was the family's maiden name when they first came over, Becerra?Mary J. Garces:	Becerra, yes. And he opened his store in 1928, his first store.Lucinda Garces:	What did he sell at the store?Mary J. Garces:	It was a grocery store.Lucinda Garces:	Ok, okay.Mary J. Garces:	And he had a gas -- He did gas also for the cars. Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	And so, how did that affect your life as a young individual?Mary J. Garces:	It affected my life a whole lot because I had older uncles -- maybe ten, twelve years older than me -- and since they had the store, they spoke English all the time because they had all of the different languages. And so, they spoke English. And so, when we went to school, we knew how to speak English very well. So, we did not have to be in this little frame building at the back of the school to learn English before we started regular classes. And on through my lifetime, it's like -- We always had a car. We got to go a lot of places that a lot of kids didn't have a chance to. We had -- We didn't have any needs. We didn't have to work like so many kids. But the thing that happened, also, that we had a good life was with the other Mexican people, they didn't want to associate with us. I mean, they came to the store, they did all their business at the store because my grandfather and my uncles would do all their paperwork, read everything for them because there were a lot of black, white, and Mexicans that could not read or write. They would just do an X on the paper for a signature from that era. And the Mexican people didn't want to associate with us because we had our rules and they felt like -- They didn't want anything to do with us. [00:05:00] Then we had a Spanish Catholic school with a church, but they didn't send us to that school, they sent us to a public school. And then at that time, the discrimination, the white folk didn't want us either. So, I've always felt like we were there in a void where we didn't belong there. We didn't belong there.Lucinda Garces:	You've always referred to when you're talking about your family as a tribe?Mary J. Garces:	Oh, yes.Lucinda Garces:	And is that stem from that same feeling?Mary J. Garces:	Well, I don't know. We just stayed together. We had our rules. Of course, they -- We knew everybody in town. We greeted everybody and talked very little to everybody, but we could not visit. We didn't do visiting. We did not -- We had to stay in our home. We went to church, we went to socials, but we didn't visit friends, we didn't spend night at other people's houses. That's how it was for us.Lucinda Garces:	Well, I know one question that Mimi had was that how the Great Depression affected you. You mentioned earlier that you were just a little after that.Mary J. Garces:	Yes. Like, my parents went through the Depression, of course, but they did not suffer because we were very close to the grandparents and live very close, so we all shared. And then when my parents had a liquor store in the '40s, I was twelve years old, more or less. And their parents didn't trust the banks, so they had all this money in the house, and they didn't speak all that much English. So, I was the one that had to walk to the post office with over a $1,000, $2,000 to send the payments for the liquor. [laughs] Now I think about it, it's like: ""Oh my God, I had all that money in my pocket."" [laughs] Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	So, this leads to one of the other questions I had about what you wish you had then that you have now.Mary J. Garces:	Okay. May I go back and add to what we just have? Well, it's like when my father got his license for the liquor store, the family had an attorney, and when the attorney handed my father the license to the liquor store, he said, ""I have something I have to tell you."" He said, ""All these businessmen in Rosenberg did not want a Mexican to have a business."" But since he was the attorney, he said, ""I decided that you were going to have a liquor store,"" and that's how my father got the liquor store license because Mexicans didn't have business. My grandfather had a business and he was accepted, but my grandfather was Spanish. They didn't look at him as a Mexican because he was -- of his color, and he didn't look Mexican at all. Okay. Get back to what you --Lucinda Garces:	Well, one of the things you've mentioned that what you wish you had then that you've had now, what the difference was or what it was?Mary J. Garces:	I wish I had freedom. Because yes, we went to school. We did not miss school at all, and we did not stay home to take care of the other children like so many families did, or to go to work. We were free to go to school. But other than that, it's like we had rules. Nobody got after us, there were just set of rules and since all the uncles and aunts who had children had the same rules. We followed rules, we went places, we went lots of places. I knew all of Houston when I was young because we came to Houston, often to Galveston, and San Antonio, and to the border. My grandparents went to visit the relatives in Mexico. So, I had lot's going on, but freedom to like go live in apartment, no. If I didn't want to work, I didn't have to go work, but I did want to go work.Lucinda Garces:	And how did that change? When you started looking for a job, what job did you have?Mary J. Garces:	Well, a cashier. [00:10:00] I worked at Woolworth a while because it opened there in town and it was convenient. And then I worked at Battelstein's. That was a very prestigious store, like -- Equivalent of like Macy's and [inaudible 00:10:21] in that time of [inaudible 00:10:22] . And a lot of discrimination blood. Because yes, the manager who hired me was very quiet, but he hired me and I got to release the switchboard. And then the manager that we had more contact with, well, he was very nice. And when I quit, he says, ""Mary, you can come and hang your hat here whenever you want to,"" because he was at -- from Boyden. And then -- But the people who worked there, the salespeople, it's like I walked by them and it's like I was a ghost. They did not want to communicate with me. There was a lady in the office when I cashiered in the office, very nice, so nice, so sweet. Really, there were only about two people in that big store. And then there was this guy, a younger guy, that he liked to tease me and talk some. In such a big store with so many people, those are the only ones that talk to me. That's how it was everywhere I worked. I was the only Mexican and it's like they didn't want me. They didn't want me there, okay? So, that's how it was.Lucinda Garces:	But you did really well there because you got to the point to handle the money.Mary J. Garces:	Oh, yes. I was handling money. Yes, I was a cashier in the office. Yes.Lucinda Garces:	So you dealt with like, lots -- Thousands and thousands of dollars on a regular basis?Mary J. Garces:	Thousands, yes. I don't remember what the amount was. If someone wrote a check for over a certain amount, they would call the bank wherever. Whatever state, whatever country. They would call the bank before they released it because they had those tubes, you send everything up. Okay.Lucinda Garces:	Interesting. Well, I want to kind of bring in some of your past elements and the future, or the more current, elements. And one question that Mimi had was, ""Who is your favorite actress or actor, and music?"" You have two for each because you have your younger years and now the current years.Mary J. Garces:	Clark Gable was the idol. And -- What else?Lucinda Garces:	Richard Gere was the current one.Mary J. Garces:	Richard Gere, yeah, was the current one, yes. And the singers was it? Or the music?Lucinda Garces:	The music.Mary J. Garces:	Oh, I loved Glen Miller and all the big bands from that time. The new one is I love to hear Blondie sing. Something about her voice just fascinates me. I don't know what it is exactly.Lucinda Garces:	Yeah. We all thought that was very interesting that you like Blondie [laughs], but that's great. If you could go anywhere now -- Because, I mean, you've had lots of experiences as a young person, but now if you could go anywhere, where would you go? Where would it be?Mary J. Garces:	Italy. For some reason, it fascinates me. The wineries, all the shrubbery, all the flowers, all the old buildings. It's just such an ancient city that it just fascinates me, the idea of what it is.Lucinda Garces:	When -- You also had lots of challenges when you were growing up, also, like a lot of people do. And I know that your children have meant a lot to you, mom. Can you describe in one sentence or a short phrase of what each child means to you or what they've contributed to your life. Start with Adrian and go in order.Mary J. Garces:	Adrian, of course, is my first child, and [00:15:00] he was teasing me and he would always tickle me and then say, ""Mom, you're fat."" Then he would always tease me. He was always teasing me. He'd tell me all these stories, all these comments, and I'd say, ""Adrian"" and he says, ""Oh, mom,"" and he started laughing. He loves to tease, he still does, and he can talk and talk. We can talk for the longest. [laughs] Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	And he's the one that ended up at HSPVA?Mary J. Garces:	Yes.Lucinda Garces:	And then he got into Otis-Parson School of Design in LA?Mary J. Garces:	Yes.Lucinda Garces:	And was doing really well for himself, so.Mary J. Garces:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he was --Lucinda Garces:	Very creative.Mary J. Garces:	He was my first child. And when he told me he wanted to study that, and he told me the different places where they had one, and Dominican Republic was one of them. And he says he had choices, and I said, ""Adrian, I don't call these choices. These are perverted cities!"" [laughs] And the Dominican Republic,  always fighting the revolutions. I was there like, ""Choices? I don't think so."" [laughs] But he decided to go to California and I was okay with it.Lucinda Garces:	What did -- What did John -- How did John affect you?Mary J. Garces:	Well, John was very quiet. And he was always caring, but very quiet and very independent. The first day of school he said, ""Mom, I know what I'm doing, you can go home."" [laughs] And that's John for you. And he didn't say what he's doing, but he's a lover. It's like [inaudible 00:16:48] the way he loves. He's there for all of y'all. He's very good, a hard worker like all of y'all. Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	And your next kid was me.Mary J. Garces:	Cindy! [Lucinda laughs] I finally got the girl I always wanted. My little angel. And it's like, ""Oh, I wasn't all my Cindy because my Cindy was a beautiful little angel."" And you're so determined and a hard worker and I'm so glad you finally got your degree. Yes.Lucinda Garces:	Yes. Thanks, mom. And Mimi?Mary J. Garces:	Mimi? Oh my God, I kept telling Mimi, ""Mimi, you're the one that's going to keep me going, keep me young"" but now I wonder what I -- if I should have said that, because I'm already 75 and she's still hollering ""mom!"" [laughs]Lucinda Garces:	How old were you when you had Mimi?Mary J. Garces:	Forty-two. So, yes.Lucinda Garces:	Forty-two. But it was a good reasoning that you told her that she was going to keep you young.Mary J. Garces:	Yes, yes. Yeah, and keeps me happy all the time. She's a hard worker and she's loving and all of you were so loving. And I loved and remember those holidays when all of you at y'all's time would come with one cookie and divided in how many pieces? Then we all had the most delicious crumb of whatever cookie y'all brought home. Yes. There's lots of love in the family, mi mija.Lucinda Garces:	That's good.Mary J. Garces:	Yes.Lucinda Garces:	Well, was there anything specific that you wanted to that I didn't ask you questions on, but you wanted to talk about?Mary J. Garces:	It's like the discrimination affected be so much. It's still -- I still get this little -- At Bowman's because my friends are white people, my close friends. And yet, it's like that discrimination is there for me because I did not -- I did not pass it on to y'all. I never did, or I try not to, but I have it. It's like we were -- Oh, we'd go to a business place and we could be in line and it's like, well, we had to wait longer than the ones that were behind us sometimes. And it's like, ""This is the most ridiculous thing."" But that one time I went with my friend, white friend, a few years ago to this something at the fairgrounds. And there were a lot of businesses and they were handing out different things and I enjoy that. Then I went through all the booths. Then we get to this booth, where they're giving oranges -- Oranges or apples, I don't remember. And my friend grabbed one and I said, ""Oh, [00:20:00] I don't want one."" And she said, ""Well Mary, why don't you want one?"" I said, ""I just don't want one."" She says, ""I can go get it."" I said, ""No, no, I don't want one"". And then after we walked away from there, I was telling her, ""You must think how silly I am. It's ridiculous. But when I got to the booth and I saw this white --"" I don't know. It was a man and a woman. When I saw them, something just clicked and I said, ""I don't want anything from them."" And see, I was already in my 60s and it's like I want to get rid of it. And I discuss it with y'all, about giving this up. But I still have that little like, ""Am I going to be accepted here or not?"" And although I've had the education that these white people have, and I still feel like -- It's hard to explain. It's just in here. Yes.Lucinda Garces:	It doesn't quite go away.Mary J. Garces:	But I had a wonderful life. We struggled, you know, my children and I. We struggled for y'all to go to school. It was very difficult. And all of y'all have studied something that y'all wanted to study Yes. That is the greatest thing, my children.Lucinda Garces:	Well, I remember that growing up, even though we didn't have a lot of funds, at least you did every -- If something was that important, everything was done to get that, whatever it was. And -- And, you know, I know it was Adrian got a piano. Because, you know, we all got something different out of that.Mary J. Garces:	Yes, yes.Lucinda Garces:	And -- And in reference to the racial aspect, it's very true, but we were raised very American.Mary J. Garces:	Oh, yes. I was raised American, too. Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	But it's interesting because even the questionnaire that we were just filling out for this project --Mary J. Garces:	Yeah. You see how I feel?Lucinda Garces:	Is that I don't --  Trying to clarify, you know, how I feel about what I consider my demographics. And I think that it is -- It has nothing to do with colors of race. It's just being an American, which is very interesting because that is really hard to separate for people to say you're American, but you also have this race connection with it. And I'm glad to say that I'm raised to be able to make that division.Mary J. Garces:	Yeah. Well, see, like -- We were raised very American because my uncles played football and the girls would hang on to them. And they were good. And they were short, two short ones. [Lucinda laughs] And then, it's like at the park, our park, at the city park when I was a kid, they always had some bands playing on the platform they had. We always went to that, we went to the 4th of July, we celebrated. We lived an American life, but then we didn't belong with the white folks. I mean, they tolerated us, but you didn't feel comfortable. Well, we went because that's how we felt. Okay? There, we didn't stay home because they all didn't want us there, but we went and we were Americans. That's what we were, and that's how we were raised. Yes.Lucinda Garces:	Well, mom, I want to say thank you so much for agreeing to do the story for our project. Because sometimes we don't always understand people's experiences or why people react to different situations in different ways. Like the orange story you're talking about, about saying no, you didn't want anything. But it makes it a little more clear on why, you know, you had that feeling, and why you were so strong about that feeling.Mary J. Garces:	Yes, Cindy. Like when I get a form that I have to check what I am, it just like it irks me because when I was in school, they said, ""check white, [00:25:00] check Caucasian."" So, the longest -- For so many years that's what it was. I had to check white and Caucasian. Then is somewhere along the way Mexican came in, and then after a while it's Latino. And it's like, the white have always been white, but we have never been white, you know, on paper. We have never been the same all our life. And it's --Lucinda Garces:	It bothers you.Mary J. Garces:	It still bothers me. Like right now, it's like, I hate to. [Lucina laughs[Lucinda Garces:	Yeah.Mary J. Garces:	Yes. Like when Adrian went to school, and he says, ""Mom, what do I check?"" I said, ""Oh, check white."" So what happens? Because it was PVA and so many of each race and counties and all that. And I said, ""Well, just check off white."" And he said -- And then when they went over his paperwork, they told him that they couldn't take him in as a white person. But since he had a Mexican last name, he could come in as a Mexican. So, it's like, ahh! [Lucinda and Mary laugh] Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	The contradiction of things and the irony of it. But on all our birth certificates, the only thing that's marked is white.Mary J. Garces:	Yes.Lucinda Garces:	Yes. So it makes it a little more challenging.Mary J. Garces:	Yes, yes.Lucinda Garces:	Well, Mom --Speaker 1:	Can you talk a little bit more -- Sorry, I interrupted you.Lucinda Garces:	No. Go ahead.Speaker 1:	Can you talk a little bit more about what it means to be raised American? Like what does that mean?Mary J. Garces:	Well, you know, my grandparents came from Mexico. Okay. They had their Mexican heritage, their customs, their clothing, their everything, their food, and they came over here. They had to eat bread, and it's like my grandfather wanted corn tortillas. So my grandmother had a grinder and they would get the corn, and she would have to go through the whole process of making the corn, the masa, to make corn tortillas everyday. And then it's like we had to get adjusted to, or they did, to the clothing. The -- At first, there was no Mexican Catholic church. We had to go to the white folks Catholic church. It was not a very comfortable feeling till the missionaries came from Canada to start the Mexican Catholic churches. We still have Mexican Catholic churches. There were so few Mexican people, that they were really not enough people to do the Mexican thing, the festivals and all that. So, it was all American. It's not -- It's -- There was not anything Mexican. It was all American, and that's how we were raised.Lucinda Garces:	You meant --Mary J. Garces:	I feel American, I don't feel Mexican, but I know I'm Mexican and that's there. And I don't want to erase it, because it's there.Lucinda Garces:	Right, right.Mary J. Garces:	And I don't want to be moved to a different category because I'm a Mexican. But I'm American, because we went to school and all those things that are American. Yeah.Lucinda Garces:	So, you even mentioned the celebrating Fourth of July and -- Mary J. Garces:	Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.Lucinda Garces:	Those kind of involvements.Mary J. Garces:	Oh, yeah. And my aunts being in business, my grandfather -- Well, you know that, they had a very good meat market section, and a lot of these people that had their own restaurants would come buy their meat from my grandfather. So, donations to whatever in the American way. They always were donating something or other for the American way. Okay? And we had to have -- We did have our own attorney. The family had an attorney, because then, it was the idea that they were Mexicans and they had to have an attorney to -- for them to, um -- go to what was [00:30:00] the right thing to do different things. Okay? Yeah. That's how it was.Lucinda Garces:	American to me means that you do for others without thought to black, white, Asian, and you do it for a good reason.Mary J. Garces:	Yes. Many years ago, I was at the doctor's office with my mom, and this little black old man comes up to us and he tells mom, that he remembers grandpa. That he needed money to buy seeds to plant, and the bank did not lend Mexican and black people money. Okay? My grandparent was in a totally different position. So, this little black guy was telling us, he says he remembers -- Tears were rolling down his eyes. He said, ""I went to Mr. Joe and I said, 'Mr. Joe, will you lend me some money and I'll pay you as soon as I can?'"" He says,""Oh, Mr. Joe came out and he says, 'Oh, yes, here's the money and you pay me when you can'."" And my grandfather did a lot of social work, a lot of -- Yes. Helped lots of people; white, black and -- White, black, and Mexican. All of them. They did not discriminate, because you'd be surprised how many white people did not know how to read and fill a form. Like, there were forms, all the time. There's always been forms, yeah, to fill. My grandfather was always ready to give, always.Speaker 1:	What was your grandfather's name? What were your grandparents' names?Mary J. Garces:	Jose Maria Brecerra, and my grandmother was Severa Galvan. My grandmother was very Indian. My grandfather was Spanish. He was 100 percent Spanish. He had blue eyes and rosy complexion. A short guy, yeah.Lucinda Garces:	Well, thanks again, mom, for spending time in doing this with me and I promise I won't tell your job what you skipped work for. [Lucinda and Mary laugh]Mary J. Garces:	Yeah.",1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
MBY006038,"Jose Luis Gonzalez: [00:00:00] Jose Luis Gonzalez, I'm 60 years old. Today's December 10th, 2009, and we're located in Houston, Texas.Johnny Marino: My name is Johnny Marino, age 90. Today's date, December 10th, 2009. Houston, Texas.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Tío, I'm glad you came that we were able to get together. With life being so busy, we don't get to see much of each other.Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So it's a privilege that I am here with you. So the first thing I'd like to ask you is, where were you born?Johnny Marino: I was born in a little town in West Texas, Colorado City, Texas. June 24th, 1919.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Did you grow up there in Colorado or did you move over to Houston right away?Johnny Marino: My father was a railroad man and we moved around quite a bit. I don't recall really all the little towns that we stayed when I was growing up. The last town I remember is Crosby, Texas. He had left the railroad job and started farming.Jose Luis Gonzalez: You were telling me that he started with the railroad. Can you tell me a little bit about your dad, where he was born, how did he make it over to the United States?Johnny Marino: My father was born in Chihuahua, Mexico. When he was a young man, he joined the Francisco Villa troops that were fighting against the Mexican government. I believe after the, I don't know if you call it civil war, he decided to move into Texas and he crossed the river paying, he told me five cents he paid to cross the river. That's when he started working for the railroad, Southern Pacific Railroad.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So how did he meet your mom?Johnny Marino: Mom, I remember her. I believe I was probably nearing my fourth year, age four, that I remember my mother, and to this day I can still remember her face. I didn't really know my mom too much, because I remember she passed away in 1928. So I was really about four years old or six, or something like that. But I remember her. We lived on a farm at the time when she passed away. She passed away here in Houston. I remember where she was buried. To this day I know the cemetery where she was buried, and I've never forgotten that.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Where was she born?Johnny Marino: My mom came from Spain. She was born in Valencia, Spain. Her dad was Italian and he met, I guess my grandma on my mother's side in Spain, they married, my mom born there. Then later years they came to Mexico and somehow she met my father and they eventually married, and then they eventually moved [00:05:00] to the Texas.Jose Luis Gonzalez: How many brothers and sisters? How many siblings?Johnny Marino: We were three boys and one girl. My oldest brother Emanuel, my sister Esther, myself, and my younger brother Santos. They all have passed away. Both my parents passed away when I was fairly young. I had just started elementary, you might say, when mother passed away and my father passed away when I was 18 years old. I was already in the service, military service, when he passed away. So they were really very young when they passed away. My father remarried though, two times, and the stepmothers who are the ones that brought us up. My first stepmom was from Mexico. She had two sons. Then she passed away, and of course, by that time, I was already a teenager and my dad brought us together and told us that he would never remarry. So he promised us that he would never remarry.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right.Johnny Marino: But he was a young man still, you know. And to our surprise, we found out, during a church announcement...Jose Luis Gonzalez: (laughter) That's a good one.Johnny Marino: ... That there would be a wedding between my dad and this other lady that eventually became my stepmom. We had known this lady for many years and she actually was the one that helped us until I joined the military. That was the reason I joined military. Because when they announced that my dad had remarried again, that really put me in a state of, I guess I would say, shock.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So when you decided to join the military, that's the Army, right?Johnny Marino: Yes.Jose Luis Gonzalez: That was what year and what -- Do you remember the year?Johnny Marino: That was in January of 1941.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So that was way before Pearl Harbor.Johnny Marino: Oh, yes. That was 11 months before Pearl Harbor.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So you joined but you were still a teenager, you said.Johnny Marino: I was 18. Actually 18, according to my mom's birthday record. You see, according to the Army record, I was 21. That's the reason I could join.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So the Army says, ""Come on over, we need you.""Johnny Marino: Right. But my actual age was 18.Jose Luis Gonzalez: And in January, we were having trouble, Germany was already having trouble.Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Oh, okay.Johnny Marino: Hitler was already taking over most of Europe and that really was the cause, because if you know your history, the United States had been going through some rough years like the 1930s during the Depression.Jose Luis Gonzalez: The Depression, right.Johnny Marino: During the Depression, I didn't finished high school. So President Roosevelt came up with a program for young boys that hadn't finished high school. They had a program that you could go to a university, that university would teach courses that you could learn like electricity, carpentry, and stuff like that.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So they would teach [00:10:00] all the young people a trade.Johnny Marino: Yes. Plus you could become what they call a sub-student. In other words, you went to the University classes and took basic courses like, English, typing, and stuff like that for half a day, and then half-day you went and study the course you was taking, try to learn.Jose Luis Gonzalez: What did you all have to do to do that? That's why you had to join the army?Johnny Marino: No, you volunteer for that. Then during the Christmas holiday, the universities they let their students go for a few weeks. So during that time, President Roosevelt issued another order that anyone that was 18, could volunteer for the Army, Navy, Air Force, any of those groups. You could volunteer for one year. You stay there a year, and then you will be discharged and you wouldn't have to bother with military anymore.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So in January, you joined?Johnny Marino: A group of us guys from the university, Texas A&I University in Kingsville. We came to Houston for holidays and then we decided to go to a recruiting station. We went, of course, I gave my right age, June 24th, 1922, so they wouldn't take me. They say you have to have a release paper signed by your dad. I knew dad wouldn't sign it because he told me he wouldn't. He said as soon as a school starts again in January, you go back. Some wise guy from the group, he says, ""Why don't we just changed our age? Change it to 21.""Jose Luis Gonzalez: (laughter) And then we can go.Johnny Marino: So, we went to another recruiting station here in Texas in, is it Texas in San Jacinto. There's a post office there on the ground floor, they had the recruiting station. We went there and the first thing they asked, your name, where you live, your birth date? I said, ""June 24th, 1919.""Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right away you're 21.Johnny Marino: From that day to this day, all of my records are June 24th, 1919.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Then you were there in January that you join and then Pearl Harbor happened in December.Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: December 7th.Johnny Marino: We were suppose to be discharged in January of '42.Jose Luis Gonzalez: I was going to get to that, so you're going to have your one year, but then the war broke out. So what'd they do? Since you've been training, what'd they do then?Johnny Marino: They took our unit as a training. In other words, our unit then was put in a special place to be trained for combat using the latest equipment the army was putting out. As far as learning how to shoot a rifle, throwing a grenade, hand pat, bayonet fighting all that, we had all of that.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Because already been there 10 months, 11 months. So your one year thing was over.Johnny Marino: They took us to different places to take desert training, winter training, jungle training, different places. The last one they took us to was in Wisconsin and they took us to take winter training.Jose Luis Gonzalez: After all the training and they said, ""Okay, your unit is ready to go to war.""Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Because by then we were in the war?Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Where did y'all go? Where did they dispatch you guys to or whatever they call to in a service?Johnny Marino: From Wisconsin in October of 1943, they told us you're going overseas.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So in '43, huh?Johnny Marino: Yeah, they sent us to New York and we boarded a ship that would take us across Atlantic. [00:15:00] The ship we boarded was one of these ships that were being built like here at the Ship Channel. They built some ships; those were just slapped together. Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right, called taps to shipyard. I remember that when I was growing up.Johnny Marino: It took us 12 days to cross the Atlantic because the German U-boats were sinking a lot of ships. We had to zig-zag. We made it across, but 12 days I was seasick.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Wow, for 12 days.Johnny Marino: I don't know if you have been seasick?Jose Luis Gonzalez: Yes, I have. It's the worst.Johnny Marino: It's terrible.Jose Luis Gonzalez: The worst experience in the whole world.Johnny Marino: It got so bad I just, one night I told the Lord to just take me. I didn't want to suffer that way anymore. Finally, we reached Belfast, Ireland after 12 days. They put my unit in a castle. A castle that was built probably back in the 16th century, I don't know. It's an old castle. Castles all over Europe. We stayed there and trained there. We were being trained for the invasion of Normandy.Jose Luis Gonzalez: The big invasion of Normandy, right? We've all heard of that one. Your unit was one of the units that went in there?Johnny Marino: On D-Day, June 6th.Jose Luis Gonzalez: D-Day, so June 6th, D-Day.Johnny Marino: 1944. We hit the beaches of Normandy and landed on Omaha Beach.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Omaha Beach.Johnny Marino: Yeah, there was five beaches that were -- two of them assigned to American troops and three for the British and Canadian troops. We landed on D-Day and started inland. It took us a long time.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So you recall exactly when they dropped you off right there on the beach, like we see in the movies and people blown to bits?Johnny Marino: June 6th, we hit the shore around 7:00 or 8:00 o'clock in the morning. Lost a lot of my friends that had trained with me in Fort Sam Houston, Fort Hood, Fort Sill Oklahoma. All of the guys that were in the service with me were from what we call the Valley, up around Harlingen.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right, the Valley.Johnny Marino: Edinburg and all those little towns.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So it was puro Mexicano in the whole unit just about?Johnny Marino: Yeah, but most of them were born here in Texas.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right.Johnny Marino: Most of them were born in those -- Their parents probably were from Mexico.Jose Luis Gonzalez: In those days, I don't want to get out of the subject but were we --  Did y'all consider yourself Chicanos? Or y'all were just Latinos?Johnny Marino: No, I never heard the word Latino at all, Latino. To me I don't know what they mean by Latino. I believe if you're from Mexico or South America, that's what I think. I say that if whatever you're born at, you born here in America, you're an American, period.Jose Luis Gonzalez: There you go. Okay.Johnny Marino: My parents, I don't know how to put it, but my mom was Spanish. My dad was Mexican.Jose Luis Gonzalez: But he was Indian, right?Johnny Marino: Yeah. He was a full Indian from Chihuahua.Jose Luis Gonzalez: From Chihuahua, right.Johnny Marino: Because he could speak a dialect that I didn't understand. He used to get mad with us. [LAUGHTER] He was probably calling us all the names under the sun. We didn't know what it was. He'd get mad with the horses or mules. [LAUGHTER] He'd let 'em have it in his language. But I never heard him curse in English or Spanish, never heard him. I never saw my dad with a beer in his hand or cigarette in his mouth or nothing like that.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Chihuahua, right?Johnny Marino: Chihuahua.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So going back to Normandy, the majority of them were all from here, from Texas, from the Valley. From the history that I learned, the majority of the people was a lot of casualties.Johnny Marino: Yes.Jose Luis Gonzalez: To me, [00:20:00] how is it that my uncle Johnny survived a lot of tragedy there.Johnny Marino: There's a few of us that came back. I still have contact with two, three of them. A Guy that lives in California, another one lives in Alabama, another one lives in New Jersey. That's about the only three that I remember out of the whole unit.Jose Luis Gonzalez: When y'all took Normandy, what did your unit do then?Johnny Marino: Each division would be assigned to a different area to capture. After the Normandy invasion, we went through the southern part of France into Belgium. This was in June and July, August. Then in September we were told to go to Brest in France, which is a place like Galveston. Germans were entrenched there. Well, here's Brest and underneath there were the German submarines. All of this area on top of the submarines was built by Spanish labor force: Spaniards that had been fighting General Franco in Spain during the thirties. It was getting too hot for them over there, so they fled across the Pyrenees into France. The Germans took France in the '40s without a fight, and they captured all these Spanish guys prisoners. They were put into forced labor and they built all of the cement things.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So they're like bunkers or something?Johnny Marino: Yeah.Jose Luis Gonzalez: With all the canyons that would protect the deal?Johnny Marino: They built all of these bunkers for the artillery.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Is this what was leading up to Battle of the Bulge?Johnny Marino: That was after the Battle of the Bulge.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So this was after. Did you participate in the battle?Johnny Marino: The Battle of Bulge was in December of 1944.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So you went to Normandy and then after that they said, ""Well now you're pretty good, let's send y'all, your unit, to Battle of the Bulge.""Johnny Marino: Yeah, after September, after Normandy we came back to France. That's where the Battle of the Bulge came in. See Brest was in August and September, and the Battle of the Bulge was in December.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Okay. Then they prepared you for Battle of the Bulge also?Johnny Marino: Yeah.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Wow.Johnny Marino: The reason we were really able to be victorious at Brest was because we met some Spanish guerrilla fighters from Spain that came to us and they told us, well they told me really. This guy did. They told me that they had built all the fortifications for the Germans and they knew where all of these places where. They could show us where they were and if I thought that the American government would give them a release to come to America or some, I guess money to help them build.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right.Johnny Marino: So I said, ""Well, you have to talk to the big man."" I said, ""All I can do is take you to the intelligence people and you tell them you know where this machine gun nest is, where this ack gun is, you known how to get down under where the submarines are,"" and they did. I don't know if they were compensated. I'm sure they were.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So who was in charge of your unit? Were [00:25:00] you under the General Patton?Johnny Marino: At the beginning we were under another general, I don't recall his name, but right after the Battle of the Bulge we were under General Patton.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Then after Battle of the Bulge, what did they do with y'all guys again? Now y'all are even more seasoned veterans.Johnny Marino: Yeah. After the Battle of the Bulge, that was in -- Let's see, the Battle of the Bulge started in December of '44 and it ended in January '45.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Wow.Johnny Marino: Okay, so then Patton, General Patton, he went to have a conference with General Eisenhower. Patton was known for his keen mind as far as military operations was concerned.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right.Johnny Marino: He told Eisenhower that he had a plan that if he would cut Germany right in half. Just keep on going.Jose Luis Gonzalez: He didn't want to stop. Just keep on going.Johnny Marino: So he put troops on this side and troops on this side to take care of all the Germans that were trying to escape. He said, ""You pick the units you want."" So right away he picked our division as a lead division of that prong.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So he did like a spearhead. Y'all were the spearhead. Y'all were the most seasoned veterans.Johnny Marino: Right. We were the point. I drove the first jeeps that were made. The Army had the first jeeps. They were made by Willys Corporation. I got to drive the first jeeps here at Fort Sam Houston and they were great. The only thing was the shift was up here on the wheel and every time you'd shift it, they would break off. So the Army sent them all back to  Willys and they got a contract with Ford. So then we got Ford. Ford shipped us new jeep but they were standard.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right. They were down on the floor.Johnny Marino: Right. We learned how to drive those things and those were the ones we used overseas. So we had jeeps, command cars, and big two and a half ton trucks. They called that operation -- What was the name of it? I don't recall the name of that operation. All the campaigns had names and it was the one that started to break down the German forces.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right. So what Patton had said, split it down the middle was working.Johnny Marino: Right. So our job was to be the spearhead but not engage in combat, just to report whatever we -- If you saw something unusual, you report it back and they would take care of it. But you just kept on going. What we ran into were the concentration camps.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Oh the concentration camps.Johnny Marino: Yeah.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So by the concentration camps you're talking about where they kept all the Jewish people.Johnny Marino: They had all the Jewish prisoners. Not only men and women, but children, teenagers. Not only Jewish people --Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right. So you were there when over this period you were the first ones to come into the concentration camps?Johnny Marino: Right. That was in March of '44. You don't see that on the news whenever they show the liberation of concentration camps. They don't show the initial troops that went in because we didn't have no TV cameras or stuff like that at that time. So for when media came with the rest of the troops, [00:30:00] that's when they start taking pictures.Jose Luis Gonzalez: You recall when your unit first came in? How was that?Johnny Marino: The first breakthrough we had, we got to this huge building sitting up on a hill. As we went in to that area, we came across the piles of human dead, piled up like you pile wood up. They had different piles of naked men, women, young people scattered all around. There were no guards, they had already fled. They had built a ditch about a block long, but maybe 10-15 deep and it was full of dead people, all naked. Of course, that was a shock to us. We didn't know really what it was. Maybe they also knew that there was concentration camps, but we didn't.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Because they didn't let the foot soldier know.Johnny Marino: No, we didn't. As we went in the rest of the way, we came upon the chimneys where there were some of them smoking.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Still smoking?Johnny Marino: They had some people they had burned in there, and as we went through, all this ashes were falling on our uniforms, on our caps and the stench, you could smell the stench was awful. We had put our bandannas over our face. Our jeeps and trucks and half-tracks were covered with this dust like, we didn't know what it was at first. We later found out that it was burning flesh, the flesh that was the ashes were coming down. Of course, our orders were just keep on going, we were just going through. The few people we saw that spoke English, Jewish people, we told them that we didn't have medical supplies or food or anything to give them.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So these people were actually prisoners that were now let go?Johnny Marino: Yes.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Were they like we see it in the newsreel, there was nothing but bones?Johnny Marino: We called 'em the walking dead.Jose Luis Gonzalez: The walking dead.Johnny Marino: Because all you could see was their ribs sticking out, their legs thin.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Puro hueso, right?Johnny Marino: A lot of them would walk up to you and fall down. They didn't have the strength to carry on a conversation. But we told them that there would be other people behind us that would take care of them.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So is this why we, like in the museum we have here in Houston, is that part of that --Johnny Marino: Yes.Jose Luis Gonzalez: ... [inaudible 00:33:38] the job spearheaded there?Johnny Marino: That museum, it has --Jose Luis Gonzalez: The Holocaust museum here in Houston?Johnny Marino: Yes, there's a section in there that I can show you some of the pictures they have that we came across.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So your unit is featured there?Johnny Marino: I don't think they -- They don't feature the units by name, but they have a column that tells you what unit liberated a certain camp or so. I'm a lifetime member of the Holocaust Museum. The Jewish community made all the liberators lifetime members of this museum here in Houston. In fact, before the museum was built, they had a ad in the paper that if any World War II vet had any information about the concentration camps, they would appreciate [00:35:00] if you would come. They give a name to call, and so I said I'm going to call this lady. So I called her, and she set up an appointment at Rice University, and she took my whole story, the one you saw.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Right.Johnny Marino: The whole story is at the Holocaust Museum. Yeah, so I get involved with them because they call me every April. When the future teachers are ready to graduate, they call me over to talk to them.Jose Luis Gonzalez: You're also very involved in elementaries and in any of the organizations that need you to talk about --Johnny Marino: I hesitate sometimes to go to elementaries. I go if it is the highest grade. Because to me it's just too horrible for a young kid, say in first grade or second grade.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So it's better high school?Johnny Marino: Yeah, usually high school. I've gone to several high schools. But elementaries, I go to some, but it's up in the fifth grade usually.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Time's almost running out for us tio. So one of the things that I wanted to ask you was, what are one of the most important lessons that you've learned in life that you would like to pass over to the rest of la familia here.Johnny Marino: Most important lesson. Well, I would say that I've learned throughout my life that you have to be truthful. You really -- You say something, you have to mean it and and tell the truth, because lying won't get you no where. Never. It never does. I've learned in my lifetime that you have to be honest. One thing I've learned is be yourself. Don't try to be something else. You know, I've been married with your tia for, this past October was our 44th year.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Way to go, congratulations.Johnny Marino: I don't think we ever had a spat really. I rather walk out and avoid an argument.Jose Luis Gonzalez: As long as we are truthful to each other, everything should be fine.Johnny Marino: Yes, I believe that. My main thing is trust the Lord. That's what I did when I was in combat, and I had two brothers in combat, and we all came back, all three of us. Of course, one of them has gone already, but I have one living, that lives in California. We are the only two out of the whole family. At one point when my dad married my second stepmom, there was 13 of us guys (laughter), 13 boys.Jose Luis Gonzalez: So then the main thing of everything is for us to trust in the Lord, right?Johnny Marino: Right.Jose Luis Gonzalez: Well, that's good. Tio, to me the main thing is that, the Lord.

MBY006044,"FEMALE_1: [00:00:00] Good afternoon. My name is Nina Pazucchini. I'm 30 years old. Today's date is December 11th, 2009. I'm in Houston, Texas with Octavia who I just met.MALE_1: Hey, my name is Octavio Moreno. I am 28 and today's December 11th, 2009. Here's in Texas with Nina, who I just met.FEMALE_1: Well, welcome. Thank you for coming in today.MALE_1: Thank you for inviting me.FEMALE_1: I'm glad that you're here. Let's just start at the beginning because I don't known you. So where were you born in? Tell me a little bit about that.MALE_1: I was born in Hermosillo, Mexico. Hermosillo is the capital of the state of Sonora, which is the border with Arizona in the United States. That was 28 years ago.  September 14,1981.FEMALE_1: All right. What was it like growing up?MALE_1: My childhood was amazing. I'm so grateful that I had that childhood were there were no video games. It was all playing outside. Playing soccer, playing baseball, basketball, hanging with my neighbors which were around my age. Some of them, a year two years younger and a year two years older. I grew up next to my grandmother on my father's side. I like chichi used to live house next door and my other grandma used to live two blocks from my house. So my parents and my grandparents were real close to me and I grew up with one of my sisters, which is three years younger than me. Then when I was in junior high, we got the surprise that we were going to be brother and sister again. I got my baby sister who is 17 now. She is still my baby sister for me, but she's 17.FEMALE_1: Yeah, well. What was it being seemed all of your family was surrounding where you grew up. So tell me a little bit about your grandparents. I feel it's rare nowadays to be so close to them and tell me about them.MALE_1: Well on my mother's side, I used to hang out with them almost every day when I was in kindergarten. The kindergarten on the way there, it was like two blocks away from my grandparents. So after I got off, my mom and I usually stop by my grandparents one hour two hours at least from Monday through Friday. Sunday, it was definitely going to their house after church. With my other grandparents with my father side, they live next door. Said well, they used to live next door. It was amazing. With my grandfather used to be a farmer and he and his brothers and sisters chipped in to buy a few lamps outside the city. So that they grew their own vegetables and all the things that they can grow in a farm. It was so much fun. We used to go to his farm at least once every 15 days. He was unbelievable being outside of the city, outside of the cars, the smog, all what city has just being in the farm, with the trees, with the nature. It was fabulous. My grandma, well, she was a fantastic person and I think the thing that I miss the most from her is her food.FEMALE_1: First of all, what was her name? If that's okay.MALE_1: My father's mother name is Carmen and his father is Luis. On my mom's side, Socorro my grandma and Jose my grandpa.FEMALE_1: Okay. So tell me about grandma's food.MALE_1: It's amazing. Well, she didn't grow up in the city. She was from a very small town northwest of Hermosillo, which is called San Pedro de la Cueva. There are a lot of San Pedros in the state. That one is called San Pedro de la Cueva because it was under the mountain and in front of the town, there's a cave. That's why it was called San Pedro de la Cueva. So she grew up there and she learned cooking from her mother. Usually, small towns food. It's delicious that she used to cook in a wood oven, it's still in my grandparents house. But my auntie doesn't use it very much. I'm on the believe that the closest you get to cook, according to [00:05:00] nature the taste is better. If you go from wood oven to gas oven and then move to electric oven, it tastes a little bit less, for me at least. Her food was phenomenal. Especially beans. Just plain beans and water that's it. It's amazing and jerky beef, and tamales, menudo...FEMALE_1: Describe more. So what would she make? Would she make a big thing for Christmas and the holidays?MALE_1: Usually, yes. But because we were so close to the United States, usually our Christmas, even though it's Mexico, the food gets to be very Americanized, like Turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread. Very Americanized. On New Year's, we went back to some Mexicanized food. She used to cook there menudo, tamales, beans. What else? Flour tortilla, handmade. It was just amazing. Flour tortilla by her, it was the best.FEMALE_1: That sounds totally tempting me right now. That sounds amazing. So what are some of your other memories of being with your grandmother? Do you remember what she sounded like or any sayings that she would have?MALE_1: For some reason, I cannot remember very much her voice. She hasn't been with us for five years. So I remember her face and I remember the way she behaved, but I don't remember very much her voice. Funny enough, my profession is a singer. I'm a singer. I'm an opera singer. My father tells me that nobody in my family sings or play an instrument. I'm the weirdo. My father says that my grandma used to have a very beautiful voice. I just don't remember her singing ever. Although she died when I was 16. So I only get to be with her for 16 years. When I was born, she was not that old, but she was not that young. So I don't think she used to sing very much when I was growing up. There there's a story that I remember about her, after she died. I don't believe very much in ghosts. But when she died, I was so very depressed. I -- by that point, I used to have my own bedroom. And this one day, two days before -- after she died, I was doing my praying before going to bed and I prayed to God ''please let me see her again. I really want to seen her again.'' That night, I woke up during the night and my bedroom used to have two doors, one that goes into the house and one that goes outside the house. The one that is outside the houses, the old doors that is almost metal, but with some glass on top of it. You could see the moonlight through that window. So that night when I woke up, I saw the silhouette of my grandma through the moonlight. I get so scared and I cover myself with my blanket and I said, ''grandma you scaring me, please just leave.'' I felt something sitting on my bed. The way she used to behave when she wanted to be tender. She slapped on our legs really, really hard, and then she will do how do we call this?FEMALE_1: Rubbing?MALE_1: Rub. Yeah and then rub the leg because they were a little bit tough to show love. I felt that someone hit me on the leg and I said, ""Grandma, really, just I love you, I miss you, but leave."" After that date, it happened two more days. I told that story to my mom and she said, ""Well, just spread some holy water in the room."" I did that the third night after that before going to sleep and it didn't happen anymore. I don't know if it was real. I don't known if I was dreaming. As I told you, I don't believe very much in ghosts, but that's the closest story that I have, the closest memory that I have about my grandma, and she was dead already. Probably it's not true, but I just want to believe that she heard me.FEMALE_1: And she came.MALE_1: Yeah.FEMALE_1: Maybe she's the kernel of the singing that has brought you where you are today.MALE_1: Probably. I definitely know that she's listening to me. Every time I do it. Anywhere I do it. She might be bored because I don't think she would have like opera very [00:10:00] much.FEMALE_1: No?MALE_1: No, I don't think so. She was what we call ""muy ranchera."" She was very closed into just one kind of music and that's it. Everything else is noise, so I'm pretty sure she wouldn't like it.FEMALE_1: Well, I wonder if you can take me from your childhood to you said, that you're a singer and you're an opera singer and how that evolution happened?MALE_1: That was odd, because when I was in high school, first, I wanted to be a physician. Not a doctor, but people who study physics. Is that physician?FEMALE_1: A physicist.MALE_1: Physicist, there you go and I was so deep into physicist, I really enjoyed it. The weird thing is, well, not so weird, I wanted to be a physicist with a specialty in sound. Everything that was soundproof or amplifying the sound, anything that had to be with sound. I was one of those weird kids that liked math. I was so sure that I was going to be a physicist. Also, I wanted to play soccer and we can talk about that a little bit later. So physicist came after wanting to be a soccer player. Then, toward the end of my high school, I decided I wanted to be a poet. I wanted to study Hispanic literature and languages and be a poet. I was then like 1000 percent sure that that's what I was going to be. When I went to sign up and register for college, there were two guys in front of me before registration, talking about a music degree. I overheard their chat and when it was my turn, I stood up with the lady and she said, ""Which career are you pursuing?"" In that five seconds, I changed my mind. I said, ""Music."" So poetry got behind in five seconds.FEMALE_1: What was it that made you decide? Was it just listening to those two guys? Was it impulse?MALE_1: I don't know. When I was in high school, I used to belong to a theater group and I used to do a lot of theater. I learned to play guitar, but I never thought myself about being a professional singer. It was not in my goals, but I don't know. They were talking about it so fervently, so fiery about that degree, that career, that I don't know, it just popped in my head. I want to be a musician. I didn't even know what a musician was. I mean, in a general term. I signed up and I went back home and I'm the oldest in my house. My mom was so excited that she had a son in college and she was like, ""Show me the papers, show me the papers."" So I show her the papers and she said, ""Oh, I see you're studying music too."" I said, ""No, mom. I'm studying music, period."" She was like, ""Yeah, as a hobby, but what are you doing for living? Show me the Hispanic literature and all that papers."" I was like, ""There are no papers mom. This is it. I'm going to study music."" ""Oh, for a hobby?"" ""No mom, no hobby. This is what I'm going to do."" When I went to my first lesson, well, my first week of lessons in the music degree, my voice teacher heard me in the first voice lesson. Well, when I got there, I said, ""Okay, I want to be a Mariachi singer, but a good one, like, the old guys, like Javier Solis, Jorge Negrete. Those good voice."" That's why I decided to keep studying that and my voice teacher heard me and he said, ""You know, you could sing opera."" I said, ""No, I don't want to be screaming all my life."" Because for me back then, opera was just screaming. Anyway, we went back and forth for two months. ""You should sing opera."" ""No, I don't want to scream,"" so on. By the end of middle/late November, I heard another baritone, I am a baritone. I heard another baritone friend of mine who was in third year and he was singing a lot of Largo Al Factotum from the Barber of Seville, which is better known as Figaro. I overheard that outside the classroom and I was talking to my friends, ""Wait a minute, doesn't Bugs Bunny sing this?"" He was like, ""Are you crazy?"" I said, ""No, Bugs Bunny, he does. He sings this."" He was like, ""No, you're crazy. Let's just go back to the conversation."" That Bugs Bunny thing heaved my brain and when he finished, he's less than my other friend. I went in and talked to my teacher and I said, ""Mister, may I have a word with you?"" He said, ""Yeah."" ""I want to sing this."" At that moment he knew, ""oh, I got this guy,"" because [00:15:00] he was very smart in that kind of things. He said, "" Well, if you're going to sing this, you have to sing opera."" I said, ""Okay. I'll sing opera."" In my pursuing Bugs Bunny likewise singing, I got into opera.FEMALE_1: That is an amazing story. My question for you is that first day of your first voice class, were you not scared out of your mind or you were totally confident going in, like this is what I wanted to do?MALE_1: Well, at the end of high school, I was a bit lazy and I used to skip classes and I'm really thankful to God because he made me a bit smart. I could skip two classes and then by the third class if we had a test, I needed to read the book and that's it. I was a bit lucky. My parents didn't like that too much, but I was a bit lucky. Anyway, when I started college, it was the same thing. I had the same high school idea when I got there. The first week, it was skipping classes and I didn't care too much and I only enjoyed voice lessons. But it was something different for me because from my last soccer training to my first voice lesson, it was like a bridge, like three years. Beside that, I never took any training in my body, any training until I'd gotten into voice lessons. So it was a bit different, but I don't think it was scary at all. I don't think I get scared easily unless my grandma shows up.FEMALE_1: Tell me about this soccer career, that you were going to pursue soccer and then you totally 180 and are now an opera singer. So what happened with soccer?MALE_1: Well, my mom saw it. They come from South Mexico and in South Mexico, soccer is a big deal. So all my mom's side family like soccer and some of my uncles used to play. One of them got real close to be a professional to play for the Guadalajara team, not the Chivas, but Tecos. Anyway, I wanted to do the same thing and I started playing on the local league and I made it to the CD team to play at the state competition. We weren't very lucky. We made it to the semifinals, but we didn't win. Anyway, I was not that good technically, but I was that player that runs all the time up and down, and I think that's what got me to the city team, and then on the irregular season, I get a phone call one day from the State Technical Director to see if I can join the tryouts for the State team to play the National, and I said, ""Yes."" That was a Friday and then Sunday.FEMALE_1: Well, what did it feel like to get that call? Because that's a huge deal.MALE_1: It was very exciting, because I saw some of my goals becoming real. I was really excited. Our State team, it's really bad, and it has been bad like forever. Nowadays is getting better. New generations in Northern Mexico are getting more together with soccer. Like 5, 6 years ago it was only baseball, that's it. I was very excited, and when I played that Sunday, two days after, it felt like I was already playing the National Competition, and in that game there was a play that, I used to play mid-field towards attacker. One in that game, our goalkeeper got the ball and saw me that I was alone in the forward field. He passed the ball to me. But for some reason he was really good. But for some reason, that particular play he kicked the ball wrong. The ball landed between me and a defense of the other team, and it was closer to him, but I was a bit faster. When he saw that I was going to win, he slide for the ball. Up until today, I want to think it was a mistake of him and he didn't do it intentionally, but he lift his foot and with the things on the bottom of the soccer shoes.FEMALE_1: Spikes.MALE_1: With the spikes, he hit my knee and broke one of my ligaments. I couldn't make it to the tryouts for the State team.FEMALE_1: What did that feel like? That must been.MALE_1: It was really painful. It hurt a lot, and the first doctor that saw me, he put, how do you call the thing when you break a bone?FEMALE_1: A bandage or cast?MALE_1: A cast, [00:20:00] which the second doctor told me that I didn't need that. It was a waste of time, two months with a cast and it didn't work at all. The second doctor who saw me, he said it's not a big deal if you want to have a regular life, if you're going to play soccer, you need surgery. I was like 12 or 13. So I was afraid of surgery, and probably at that point, even though I loved soccer so much, I don't think the idea of someone cutting in my skin was stronger for me to go and play soccer professionally. I said, ""no. "" He said, ""Well, you can play regularly with a knee holder."" But in the professional soccer environment, you cannot play with those things. The only thing that I could have pursued with my ligament broken was to play in the National Competition, but never professional.FEMALE_1: Well, what was it like then to give up that dream?MALE_1: It was really hard. Even nowadays, five weeks ago, I bought a game for my console, video game, FIFA 2010, and in this new version of the game, you can make your own players. So I made myself to play in Barcelona and every time I play, I'm like, that could have been me for real. Even nowadays, last night I was playing and I was telling my wife that could have been me. As I told you, I was not the best player technically, like Maradonna, Pele, the big players. But I think I was very persistent and fighter. I was a fighter player. I ran up and down all the time for the 90 minutes, but it didn't happen. Probably, I tell this story to some of my friends and they say, ""Well probably it didn't happen because you were going to be a singer."" If that didn't happen, probably I would presume something big. I wouldn't be happy until I got to play in Barcelona. I don't know where would I be if I was playing soccer, definitely not singing.FEMALE_1: You seem like you have this passionate drive, and you're going to do something great no matter what. That's amazing. You mentioned when you want it to be a physicist, that there's something about sound that really captivated you, and I wonder if you could just explain that a little bit more.MALE_1: Well, there was one particular thing that really captivated me when I was a kid. When I heard like an ambulance, you see when you're standing in one spot and you hear an ambulance far, and the sound is very deep, and then when it gets closer to you, it starts getting higher and higher and higher, and then when it moves away from you, it gets deeper again and it's dissonant. But if you stay with an ambulance all time, the sound is always the same. The pitch in the sound never changes, and that always made me think, I remember when I was probably four or five when I was like, why does it do that? When you honked the car horn, it does the same thing every time it moves away from you, even if you have a cellphone and you put it in front of you and you move it side ways, you will hear a very tiny variation of the pitch of the sound, and I remember reading about that when I was 10, so I don't remember exactly what it was, and there's a name. There was a guy who investigated about that died effect, but I don't remember right now. It has to be with the way that sound travels through air. It has to be in the way that every object in movement breaks the path of the airflow and the waves on it. It's a bit complicated and that it was the thing that interests me more back then. Also, my city is close to the beach, we used to go there very often. It's like 40 miles away. We used to go there at least once a month, and when you get one of those shells and put it in your ear, that always anything with sound that it was not natural. Speakers for me were natural. But any of those things that funny enough are more nature things and per say they should be more natural, there were natural for me, and I wanted to know why. Why does it make that sound? Is it because it's on the sea that it makes the sea sound. How about if I take it home and why does it keep making the same thing, is it a recorder, what is inside. All those things really intrigued me very much, but apparently not that much per say.FEMALE_1: Well, [00:25:00] you are now a singer and you deal with sound as a profession in a different way.MALE_1: Yeah.FEMALE_1: Making sound as opposed to analyzing why sound is. How do you think, perhaps that contributed to your singing career. How do you think about sound today?MALE_1: Exactly. Singing opera, the technique that you have to have to sing opera or to approach a level where you can really sing in a theater that holds 2,500-3,000 people without microphones. It seems easy, but when you go deeper and deeper, it's just the same thing like shells, our faces full of cavities that are empty, and you use up those like microphones, sorry, like speakers. The way that you need to make your air flow through your vocal chords to use it all those cavities, if you go physically to study those, it's a lot of things. Human body is amazing. It's an amazing mechanical, biological thing. It's wonderful.FEMALE_1: That's cool. Take me from when you're singing Figaro to what happened next after that?MALE_1: Well, after that chant, middle or late November, 1999, it took me a year-and-a-half to reach my technical capacity to sing that aria.FEMALE_1: So what do you have to do? Explain to someone who has never studied opera, how does it take a year-and-a-half?MALE_1: You have to learn how to control air. Lungs are bigger in the bottom of themselves, and we have muscle that goes through our ribs called diaphragm, and all those intercostal muscles also help to your breathing. You have to have a certain amount of pressure, and it has to be natural, you don't push and you don't lose, it has to be a natural flow of the air. Otherwise, your voice can make the same sound that ambulances do when you're standing in one point and it moves, it's the same thing. The variation on the pitch could be disastrous if you don't control your air. Also, you have to take care of you vocal chords because they work with muscles that are like -- all your throat can fit it in the top part of your thumb. So it's five centimeters. It's very tiny. So in there, we have approximately 12 muscles, so imagine the size of the muscles. So if you lift a supermarket bag full of groceries, with your bicep, you do that much strength in very big muscle. Now imagine 11 muscles in five centimeters, how much care do you have to take of those? Also, get to know all your cavities in your face, in your head. So you need to get to know your body with breathing exercises, with vocal warming exercises, and with different vowels, with different sounds, and all that takes a lot of time for your brain to register a correct way. When you're a baby, if you pay attention to a baby when he's sleeping, babies breath in the correct form. They breathe in their stomach, it always lifts and opens. When we start growing up, and start talking, the human need of talking faster for communications brings your breathing higher. So sometimes, if you work in a radio station or a TV program, usually the people has to have breathing lessons so that they can be talking during the whole day, because your breathing has to be deeper down in the bottom of the lungs. The higher it is, it creates tension in your throat.FEMALE_1: So that whole year, you're learning how to breathe deeper, to use your diaphragm, and not necessarily how to sing, but really how to breathe?MALE_1: Exactly. With that technique, even people that say, ""No, I will never sing,"" you can get to sing. If you don't have a pitch problem in your ear that is physical, you can sing. It doesn't mean necessarily that you can be a professional singer, but if you get lessons, you definitely can sing. It's just a matter of knowing your body.FEMALE_1: So was there any frustrating moments throughout that first year?MALE_1: Oh, even nowadays. Two months ago, I was singing with the Houston [00:30:00] Grand Opera, which is one of the top five in the United States, and when I was on stage, I was like, ""Oh, wait a minute. What am I doing?"" So it's like any career, you never stop learning, and if you want to be a good one in whatever you do, you always try to improve yourself a bit every day, every month, every year. So it is frustrating sometimes especially when you're starting, and especially when you're a lower voice like a baritone like myself or even a bass who's even lower than me. Lower voices develop when you get older. A tenor, which is the highest voice, can debut 22, 23 to even 20. If you're a baritone, it's more likely you're going to debut somewhere 29, 30. If you're a bass, sometimes it gets to be up to early 40s when you start making money.FEMALE_1: That's wonderful in one way because it means your career is just that much longer.MALE_1: That's the pro. Yeah, basses can leave singing up to 90.FEMALE_1: Wow.MALE_1: There was a recording, a friend of mine has a recording with the Russian bass. He was 98 and he was still singing. He walked on stage like he was devastated, like he couldn't walk anymore. But then he stand up on the point he was supposed to be, and the directors started conducting the orchestra, and his voice was like angels, and he was 98.FEMALE_1: Wow. So tell me what it felt like to work that hard for one year, and then finally sing.MALE_1: Every day during that year, I was like, ""Why don't you let me sing that now?"" He was like, ""On its time,"" my teacher. Then next week, ""But I want to do it now?"" ""No, on its time."" It was almost every week, the same conversation. When I finally reached the point when he said, ""Okay, next week you are going to sing that for me."" On the middle of the song, I stopped and I said, ""I'm sorry, can I start over? "" Because it was so demanding, and he said, ""That's what I meant every week when you said I want to sing it now, that's what I meant. You need to be ready. It's not just meaning of that you can sing the pitch and you have the air. It's a physical level that you need to approach."" I trusted him from the beginning, but at that point, he got all my trust. So I know what he's doing, he's a smart guy and he deserves all my trust. Sometimes it was even depressing during that year, because I wanted it so bad, and he was taking care of me. I thought he was punishing me because I said, ""No, I don't want to scream,"" at the beginning. But it happens to be that he was taking care of me, and he was amazing.FEMALE_1: Do you remember when you sang it through the first time?MALE_1: I don't remember the exact date when I rehearsed it through the first time, but it was September 19th, 2001, when I sang it for the first time in public. It was like a birthday present. My birthday is September 13th, and two days before he said, ""We have this show."" I already knew we had the show, but I didn't know what I was going to sing and that day, September, the 12th, he said, ""You're going to sing Largo al factotum, the 19th."" It was like a dream.FEMALE_1: You got on stage and the lights are on you.MALE_1: I had something weird. I can be very worried, but once I'm on stage and the lights are on, it's like I forget everything. Nothing's happening. Stage is mine. I have a saying that I always tell to my friends that are starting or my friends that are with me, ""After the four bar, public is mine."" So once the music starts, I give myself four bars to panic, to be nervous, to be whatever I want to be, after the fourth one, public is mine.FEMALE_1: You sang it and you were great. How did it feel?MALE_1: People clapped. So I think I was okay.FEMALE_1: So we have a few minutes left, and I wonder if I could put you on the spot. I know you're not warmed up, but I wonder if you could sing maybe a couple of bars of that song for us. Can I put you on the spot?MALE_1: Sure. Why not?FEMALE_1: Yes.MALE_1: Let me see, what is my favorite part? [00:35:00] I can't think of my favorite part, but I can do the last part. It goes something like this. I don't have perfect pitch so probably I won't sing on the correct...FEMALE_1: Oh, you'll impress me. Don't worry.MALE_1: Anyway. ♪ Ah, bravo Figaro! Bravo, bravissimo. Ah, bravo Figaro!

MBY006052,"GEORGINA: [00:00:00] Hi, my name's Georgina Baeza, and I'm 27 years old. Today is December 13th, 2009. We are in Houston Texas, and I'm here to interview my good sister Gabby.GABRIELA: My name is Gabriela Baeza Ventura. I'm 39 years old. Today is December the 13th, 2009. We're in Houston Texas, and I am here with my little sister Georgina.GEORGINA: Gabby, do you have any favorite stories from your childhood?GABRIELA: I have way too many stories, but one of my favorite ones was when we were growing up. We were originally from Juarez, and when we came over to the United States, just learning how to speak English. I remember that one of the, maybe it wasn't a really good story, but it was one of those stories that really emphasized who I was going to be, and what I was going to do in English, and just learning strategies, because when we came to the United States, and I had to translate a lot for mom and dad. I remember that as I was learning English one time when other kids in the class, when we were doing math homework, that's basically the only subject that I was able to participate in my all English classes. When we had to give back the answers to the teachers, I said something, I don't remember what the answer was, but part of the answer was half. When I replied to the teacher, when I gave them the answer I said, ""Something,"" and then I said, ""half."" Oh my God, those kids in class were just so rude. This one kid was ugly as ever. I remember his name. I know I shouldn't say it, but we used to call him M&M and he was such a little pain in the neck. He started calling me halfer. I was a halfer for the rest of the year because I said half. So that's one of the stories that I remember from coming to the United States. But I have lots of stories from us growing up.GEORGINA: As a child, what did you think your life was going to be like when you got older?GABRIELA: Well, one of the things that I knew I didn't want to do, that was one thing that I always told my mom. Mom used to clean houses for a living, and I've always felt like this necessity to or the need to always help her. I felt so responsible that I didn't want her to just do all the work by herself. She was getting paid $20 a day, and whenever we would go shopping, I always saw how much she had to work at stretching those dollars, and it was just hard. So when I started going to help her because I just felt bad, and what was I going to do on the weekends? Just sit back and watch TV while she went to work? On one of those times that we went to work, to clean at this lady's house, this damn Mexican lady as well, just Mexican like we were. She told her after we finish, she finished two hours earlier. The lady told her, ""Well, since you brought your daughter, you guys should go ahead and also clean the windows."" I was so angry with mom, I told her, ""Ya vámonos, ¿qué está haciendo aquí?"" And then she was like, ""No, no, cállate. Nos vamos a esperar. Tengo que seguir trabajando porque la señora me puede quitar el trabajo."" I was infuriated. When we left, and later on I realized that was the hardest thing I could have said to her. I told her, ""I'm never ever going to be a maid. That's the one thing I'm never going to be."" Afterwards I said, ""That's it. I'm going to go to school."" I just always had so much respect for my teachers. Maybe it's something that mom taught us, from the very beginning I always value the work that teachers do from any level. When I started going to school, I figured that if I could go as far as possible in teaching, in the education field, I was going to do it.GEORGINA: What are you the most proudest of in your life?GABRIELA: Well, I'm proud of, I don't know, I have a lot of things that physically I'm proud of. I'm a 39 years old that is pretty healthy, that has done pretty well for herself economically, as a Latina. Maybe one of the things that really stands out is that we came from, we weren't very poor, we weren't like people that suffered things, where we didn't lack food or anything like that. But we had some pretty hard conditions. That's maybe the things that I feel I'm the proudest for. That I'm able to [00:05:00] look back at some of these things that we all went through as a family, and things that I went through in my childhood that I was able to overcome on my own. I think with dad being an alcoholic, with us going from being pretty well-off to not having anything at all and just being able to find the value in education and learning really early on. Learning early on that I wanted to learn how to read, that I wanted to be empowered by knowledge, that I wanted to have the power of just learning on my own. That to me makes me very proud. When I succeed in doing something by myself.GEORGINA: It's funny you say that because that's the thing that makes me most proud of about you too.GABRIELA: Yeah?GEORGINA: What are some of your best memories from school? Either from grade school, or high school, or college, or post graduate school.GABRIELA: One of my best memories is probably when I was getting my masters. When I had that long, long list of books that I had to read. I don't remember how many books were on that list, maybe 170, I don't remember. Plus my classes and I think that's one thing that I remember the most that I had. When you came to visit and we had those piles of books on top of my desk, and I was just going through one right after the other. It wasn't just that I was just reading them because I was in a hurry to finish them, but it was that I was finishing them, and I was understanding, and I was learning, and I was enjoying every single one of them, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one. That's one of the best experiences I think. Plus just being in the classroom and laughing that was fun.GEORGINA: I think that's also when I started to like literature because I was there with you experiencing all those things. Then everybody coming to your office to get your books from you, and then you taking that class on Don Quixote, and you were so excited. Then you took me to that class, and that was just wow.GABRIELA: You got to meet one of the most important professors on Don Quixote. You saw how he was himself. He had been studying Don Quixote for the past what? 50 years?GEORGINA: Yeah, he was a modern-day Quixote.GABRIELA: He still found many things on it that we know that if you read it, you think ""oh, well there's nothing else on this book,"" but he made it so valuable for me. I still keep that notebook, and I passed it on to some of my students, and to other people, so that they know exactly what they're reading.GEORGINA: Do they have to sign a contract to give it back to you?GABRIELA: Almost.GEORGINA: All right. Was there a teacher, or teachers who had a particularly strong influence on your life?GABRIELA: Yeah. I think when we came to a El Paso, of course, Mr. Gutierrez. We tortured that poor man. He was just a fantastic person. I don't think I've ever told him. After this, I'm going to have to go and tell him, or write him a letter, or something. He was just fantastic. He was so patient with us as we were learning English, and he took on this cold group of students that didn't really want to be with him, they thought because he was young, they could do all crazy things to him, and he endured all that. He encouraged us to learn, and to become better students. Then of course, in my graduate work, of course Dr. Diana Rebolledo, she is one of the best female professors there is, and she encouraged us to do so many things for ourselves and to learn so much. I remember when I took her class on feminism, she looked at us, each one straight in the eyes, and she said, ""After this class you're never ever going to be the same."" It was true. In my last years of study of Dr. Canelos. He has laid the foundation for all the work that I do, and without him, I think a lot of us that are in the field of US-Latino literature would be nothing.GEORGINA: Yeah. Do you want to tell people what your job is?GABRIELA: Yeah. I'm a specialist in US-Latino literature in a Spanish department which is a difficult thing to do, or at least in 2009, still it's pretty difficult to do. There's still a lot of marginalization, and criticism, and... ¿Cuáles son las palabras que me faltan?  Mistreatment, not mistreatment, but [00:10:00] misconceptions, and there's still a lot of lack of recognition of Latino literature as part of curriculum in just general literature of the United States, as well as Latin American literature. It's that bastard child that nobody wants to recognize. It's the literature that is written in English and in Spanish or mixed. The characters, they're people just like anybody else who comes to the United States. There's all different areas that are covered, different characters that are covered in this type of literature that is just left out and marginalized because the different mainstream literatures don't want to recognize it. Especially, in a Spanish department, that's even worse because we have a lot of hierarchies and we have a lot of disrespect for anything that is not proper Castilian literature. That's been a little bit difficult. That's what I do. I'm a specialist in US Latino literature in a Spanish department where I teach. I am not teaching my graduate students and my undergraduate students that US Latino literature has existed in the US just before the US was created as a country. Those Latinos were writing in the US since before the US was considered a country. A lot of students come out of these classes and they wonder, ""Why didn't I read about this? Why didn't I know about all this stuff that was going on? Why didn't I know about all these literature? I really wish I would've known that."" That's one of the things that I do and then I'm also the executive editor at Arte Publico Press.GEORGINA: Do you have any favorite stories from your work life?GABRIELA: From my experience as a professor, there's a lot of always really good stories from students. The very rewarding stories about students that didn't really know what was going on. They're learning about this new literature and it's just opening their eyes. What is wonderful is a lot of them can extrapolate some of the stories that we're reading and the characters to some of the work that they've already seen and so that's always very rewarding. As an editor, there's a lot of stories about the crazy authors. Like for example, this is not a crazy author, but the time when we were working on a book by Isabel Allende was a biography, a children's biography that somebody from California had written about Isabel Allende, so we decided to publish it. I figured if Isabel Allende is still alive I might as well contact her and see if I can maybe even get her to look at the manuscript and see if she approves of it or if she has any changes. Well, I was able to contact her. We had published another author who had also worked on some of her essays. I mean on her work, but she had written essays on her work. She put me in contact with Isabel Allende and this was during the first few years that I was an editor. All of a sudden I get this call and I had sent her the manuscript. I get this call at my office and then I say, ""Hello."" Then she says, ""Gabriela."" I said, ""Yes."" She says, ""This is Isabel Allende."" I said, ""No."" She says, ""Yes, this is Isabel Allende."" Then I said ""No, you're kidding, right?"" She said ""No, this is Isabel Allende."" She was already getting upset with me. I froze. I just didn't known what to say. My finger is shaking. I have all my notes from that time. I still have it because I was so nervous talking to her. She was very, very nice. Just recently, we are going to publish a book by Ann Rockefeller, a book on the Arts of Mexico that her father collected. The book was previously published but we're going to reissue the book in English and in Spanish. This is the first time that it's going to be done in Spanish which was Rockefeller industry. When I got to speak to her a couple of weeks ago, I was just as nervous too, but she is a very nice lady. We started talking about the arts and about her father. I was very excited. I was nervous but I wasn't as nervous as when I talk to Isabel Allende. [00:15:00] But it's hard to tell these people about mistakes that they've made or repetitions that they made on their work. When Ann Rockefeller first called me, she said, ""Well, I want to talk about all the corrections that you have for my foreword. I was very nervous.GEORGINA: That's pretty funny. What are the most important lessons you've learned in life?GABRIELA: Maybe not to take things too seriously and just to let go of some things, just to figure out a way to make yourself healthy, not keep things on your head and let them bother you. If something doesn't go the way you want it to go, because I'm a very much of a control freak, if something doesn't go the way I want it to go, things are going to be fine. I think with this whole thing working in the US Latino field, I find that it's coming around. I feel that there's a lot of struggle that's been going on. Many of us have always been saying, respect Latinos for who they are. Let us value our language. When we were little and we were learning English, we were always very concerned about not losing our Spanish, and about keeping our Spanish intact, and about being proud of who we were even though people around us, in the communities around us really, really tried to repress that. We always kept it, even though it might have been hidden, we still kept it. I think that's what's going to happen if you just not worry so much about and not worry about fighting for every single minute and not being very reactive to whenever somebody doesn't like you or doesn't like something about what you're saying. They'll come around. They'll see the point of it.GEORGINA: How has your life been different than what you imagined?GABRIELA: It's been very different because I imagined that I was going to become a professional anyway because I was going to fight for it regardless, even if it it took me $20,000, $40,000 of loans, even though it didn't, thank God. It's just different in that things don't always work out the way you imagine that they're going to work out. You feel that you are going to do things by a certain age, and they don't happen. So when they do happen, you just have to be patient so that they happen when they're supposed to happen. But I think I've pretty much achieved what I said I was going to do professionally. So at one point I said, ""Okay, so what is next? What do I have to do now?"" So I have to go back now and start all over and set out a new set of goals because I then don't want to just sit back and relax and say, ""Okay, I did what I said I was going to do, and now I have to go back."" So I'm learning that I have to keep myself refreshed and and keep on, not just sit back and continue working.GEORGINA: So what does your future hold for you?GABRIELA: I think I have to definitely do a lot more research. I have to go back. I did an anthology about US Latino literature where I discovered that the maker of US Latino authors was in El Paso. So I need to go back and then start looking at that a little bit more. I've already valued who and what El Paso is for me in my life, and I think I need to go back and maybe start thinking a little more about it as part of a research project. So that's something that's in the future, and who knows, I will fully, eventually, one of these days become a full professor. That would be nice, and hopefully, see you graduate from graduate school with a Creative Writing degree, hint, hint.GEORGINA: Who has been the biggest influence all your life? What lessons have been taught you?GABRIELA: Probably, the biggest influence has been my little sister. When you were born, it was like this whole wonderful thing opened in all of our lives and in our families. We were going through a lot of hard times, and I think it was a way to solidify all of our goals. At that time, we moved to the United States. You [00:20:00] were just a year old, and I remember just thinking, she's now going to have all of these wonderful experiences that I had growing up in Juarez because we had so much fun. Our parents were totally different than from what you experienced when you were 10. By the time you were 10, our parents were a complete dysfunctional family. But when I was 10, we had a blast. So I knew all of these things were going to be changing. When we moved to El Paso, just having to take care of you being probably like the people there were always around you having to take care of you, having to teach you all these new things, you just became a reason to do better. So that's something that I value as a very strong influence because influencers, they're not necessarily pasts that are laid out so that you follow them, they're laid out there so that they inspire you to do better things. I think it made me become more responsible person, a better person, I think. Then when I saw you, you become now that you are a teacher, now that you're a successful teacher, and now also a successful writer, I think that can only inspire me to do better because if you're a successful writer, then I have to become a successful critic in academics then I can work on your books.GEORGINA: So we have a good cycle going on here.GABRIELA: That's right.GEORGINA: Because you inspire me and I inspire you. So are there any words of wisdom that you would like to pass on either to me or to your daughter, or to those students who are in your class and don't really ever listen, but would maybe hear this one day?GABRIELA: Yeah. That to always keep on reading, to always be curious, to never let that curiosity die down. The minute that we become these people that are not curious about what's going on, we don't care to watch the news, we don't care to know what's going on outside of our immediate world, if we lose that, then we become just machines that are going through the regular mechanisms of life. I think if you're curious, you're going to want to do many more things. You're going to want to read, you're going to want to explore other worlds, you're going to explore other things, even if you love to watch TV, one day switch a channel. If you're used to watching every Sunday you watch Desperate Housewives, when Desperate Housewives is not there, watch something else, watch another show that you would have never watched, and then you're going to start exploring other worlds that are beyond you. You have to start with little steps. But of course, the most important thing is to just be curious, and hopefully, that will lead you to reading. I don't know how, but it should.GEORGINA: Let's see. So is there any other stories you want to share, maybe about George or any other sibling?GABRIELA: Yes. I know which story you're digging for. Well, this was probably the one of the best stories I have ever, and I think that I didn't want to necessarily share it because I think you'll really see my inner workings. But when we were growing up, my youngest brother and I were very, very close. We were so close. We're only a year and a half apart. He is very sweet and loving. He's a wonderful, wonderful boy who was a very much of a mama's boy, and loved us dearly. So he and I would do a lot of things together. There's one day my parents had left us alone, and they had gone grocery shopping; and my brother and I, we had to do chores. I don't remember. But I'm washing the dishes and all of a sudden my brother comes in, and he's like, ""Gabby, look at my foot, I don't know what's going on with me."" Then I looked at the back of is foot at the chamorro. How do you say that in English?GEORGINA: The calf.GABRIELA: The calf, and I remember that we had been bike riding, and somebody had let us borrow bike, and it was one of those old bikes that the chain would fall apart, and so the pedals would hit you. So I know that he got hit on the back and scraped him. So I looked at him and I said, ""Oh, what's going on?"" Then he said, ""Yeah, I know, I don't know what's going on."" He had a bunch of little dots, and I said, [00:25:00] ""I think maybe you have gangrene. Oh, my God, my poor brother."" Well, I should paraphrase this by saying that in El Paso and in Ciudad Juarez they used to have this show called...GEORGINA: Cabada.GABRIELA: Yeah, with Armando Cabada where people in Juarez go to him and ask him for anything that they needed, for food, somebody who was missing in your family. It was like a public service work community type of thing where people would go and ask him for help, and then the community would come in and get donate money or a wheelchair or whatever. So needless to say, they always had a the case where somebody had gangrene and their foot have fallen off, and they would even show it, the camera would focus on him. So here's my brother. I tell him that I think he has gangrene. He starts crying. He must have been like 13 or 14. He cried and cried and cried. I couldn't make him stop crying, and then I told him, ""I'm sorry, I'm just kidding you. I was just lying. I don't think it's gangrene. Remember that you hit yourself with the pedal? It's probably, just the scars."" Then he would just cry and cry. He couldn't stop crying. So my parents get home, and he's still crying. This is like 30 minutes later he said, ""I'm just going to die, and I'm going to die."" Nothing made him stop crying. I even told him that I was sorry, that I had lied to him, that it wasn't true; and then he would say he told his reply was ""It's just that you loved me so much, and you don't want me to die, and you're usually you're lying to me, and I know I'm going to die"". Anyway, my parents came home and I got in so much trouble. I went outside as soon as they drove up, and I started helping them with the groceries so that they wouldn't get suspicious and my mom said, ""Call your brother to come and help."" Then right there, I told her, ""I don't know what's wrong with him, he won't stop crying."" So they went in and found out what I had told him. They just couldn't believe it. Finally, I think my dad convinced him that he didn't have got gangrene by telling him to go outside and help.GEORGINA: You did get in trouble for it?GABRIELA: Yes. I got in a lot of trouble. He still remembers and he hates me for it, but that was our life.GEORGINA: Well, I just wanted to thank you for coming here with me, and I really want to interview you because you're the person that I think has helped guide me so much in life.GABRIELA: I'm glad I got to do this with you because I don't think I would have done it with anybody else. You provide me with a lot of inspiration and focus in my life, and I'm very grateful that you are my little sister.GEORGINA: I'm grateful you're my big sister, my good sister.",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
MBY006068,"Bolivar Moyano Fraga: [00:00:00] My name is Bolivar Moyano Fraga. I'm 35-years-old. Today is December 17th, 2009. We're in Houston, Texas and I'm with my parents, Nelly and Felix Fraga.Felix Fraga: My name is Felix Fraga, 80-years-old. Today is December 17th, 2009, and we're located in Houston, Texas.Nelly Moyano Fraga: My name is Nelly Moyano Fraga and my age is 66-years-old. Today is December 17, 2009, and it's Friday, not Thursday. Location, Houston, Texas.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: So Dad, we just celebrated your 80th birthday back in October. So I'd like to start out by asking how do you feel to be 80?Felix Fraga: It's a good feeling. I don't feel I mean, I don't know how you're supposed to feel when you're 80, but I don't seem to remember feeling any different than last year, year before last or ever. It just seems a natural thing to just continue to become older I guess. It's harder for me to get around. My legs are weaker, I get tired. If it wasn't for my legs, I wouldn't know I was 80.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: So we had a pretty big celebration for you at the community center where you worked for many, many years, Ripley House, which is part of Neighborhood Centers Incorporated, NCI, where you've been for 63 years total and you're still there, on the payroll. We had this great celebration there with Archbishop Fiorenza being there and so many different elected officials, public officials, and just a great turnout from the community. But what was that like for you Dad?Felix Fraga: Probably one of the greater days in my life other than when I married your mother. But it was a great event, greatest joy where to see that the other people were happy to be there, which I don't know whether I say I didn't expect that, but it's good to see that they're happy at being at somebody's birthday. It was great to see people that have known all my life just about and people that I think highly of. I was glad to become aware that they think highly of me also. That was great.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Mom, what was like for you there celebrating Dad's 80th birthday there at Ripley House. Carlos, my older brother, came in with Amanda, our niece.Nelly Moyano Fraga: It was a great day for me. I didn't expect there really to see my two sons celebrating his Dad's 80-years-old, and to have our granddaughter dancing, performing the classical ballet. It is a great feeling and to see all the people that Felix has helped through the years and listen, so many of them thanking him because of his leadership. Their life has been improved. It has changed, they're doing better. Especially thank you, God because he was at the opportunity for my husband, for Felix to hear that. Thank you now and to see all the demonstration of love. Now that he's alive, it really is something that we really have to thank you God for that opportunity.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Mother reminds me that this 80th year for Dad, 2009, that another great honor reflecting the fact that you've had such a positive impact here in Houston is that the new Houston Community College campus or building, right? The new building that's part of the Houston community southeast region of Houston, who's named in your honor. The groundbreaking was back in March, and then just the ribbon-cutting ceremony was earlier this month of December. I definitely see that as another highlight in your 80th year here. So what was that like for you, Dad?Felix Fraga: I think I've mentioned there that I was great that I have lived as long as I have to see this day when the college was being built, because we worked on a hard to try to get that area, that property be used for a college building and to see that building, what we call our Neighborhood Second Ward. I never thought I would see a college building or even high school build in Second Ward. So that was [00:05:00] a great feeling and to see the joy that was given other people was even a greater feeling.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Mom, I remember that at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the Chancellor of HCC recognized you as well as being Dad's partner, not only in the marriage but in the work. I felt that she was recognizing what you've done also in the community. What was that like for you?Nelly Moyano Fraga: It's another very emotional feeling to be mentioned and be part of my husband life, that he has been dedicated to the community. In my case, it has been great. I had the opportunity to be working with the community too, and especially with the children and youth and that they had been participating in cultural programs, keeping our roots alive and not the only one, the one that we bring from different countries. But accept in and learning the one from where we are right now in Houston. So we are learning some western dances and something related to the Texas culture. So to know that the people thank you and they recognize you for that, it's really very nice to know that. Thank you again for the opportunity to be recognized.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: When you talk about the culture, referring specifically to the folk dance group Ambassadors International Ballet Folklorico here in Houston that you founded with three other women, two other women, excuse me. Three of you total, three moms that founded back in 1979, which has been housed at Ripley House. So when I was working on putting together the birthday celebration, I thought about this partnership with two of you, which I think is a very beautiful thing. I love the fact that the two of you have a great partnership besides just being married. Dad, when you were saying just a bit ago about the HCC building there in our neighborhood, that the property that it's on used to be a bus barn, right?Felix Fraga: Yes.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: When you said that we worked on it, I know the we is a larger group of community people but also very much you and mom, right?Felix Fraga: Yes.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: I just remember for the longest time that property was a bus barn and there were issues with environmental cleanup because of just from the vehicles that were under the buses and the oil.Felix Fraga: The batteries and everything, the whole water table was contaminated. That was making any kind of develop there impossible. But it finally got clean enough to where they would let you put a college building on there and the high school building.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Anyway, we're so sad in a way. We were so much for having a nice neighborhood there.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You wanted a house. I remember we talking about we wanted to have a house in there.Nelly Moyano Fraga: There were housing and even we haven't contacted the community for the name for that area, for the community, new community is wanting to be Lavilla des Las Flores, a lady from Pasadena. One of the students from Rice University came to do his studies, part of his-Bolivar Moyano Fraga: His thesis.Nelly Moyano Fraga: - thesis. It was in wayside that it was not that, because we were hard for it but in ways turn out great. Anyway, now we're having this educational building, which is wonderful for the entire community.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: All right.Felix Fraga: In fact, the streets were all put in for housing. There we're going to be 59.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Housing units?Felix Fraga: Yes, 59 affordable housing units. That would have been a great use of the property. But this is even as great I think. Maybe in the long run, we're going to benefit more from this and from anything else that you could have put on that property.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: All right. I'm happy to hear that. So when you think about your partnership and again, there's a connection with the community and specifically Ripley House. So I want to go back to when the two of you met. If you could think back and take a quick second or two to think about what is your first memory of each other? Whoever is ready can go first. But what's your first memory dad of mom, and mom of dad?Nelly Moyano Fraga: When I came down from the airplane. It was Harvey airport. It's not like it's now the international.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yes, only Harvey was there.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes. Only Harvey, and we had to walk. There was no cover.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: There was no jet way.Nelly Moyano Fraga: I saw your father right there waiting with another gentleman. He was from Venezuela. [00:10:00] He came to study some housing projects. Here we are, this girl from India, Giovanna and myself we came down from the airplane and I saw your father right there. I mean, this gentleman Philis [inaudible 00:10:16] was waiting for us. I felt great in a way because we had two person that were waiting for us. We didn't know who was going to be there. So to know that are friendly people, people that is from the organization that we hear they want to receive us. He was nice, he has a nice smile. He was smiling at us and right way he spoke to me in Spanish, which was no, well, not too good for me because I was learning and practicing English.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yes. I remember you.Nelly Moyano Fraga: But it was nice to hear in Spanish the welcoming that he did to me.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: I remember you always saying that the best English you spoke is when you first came here in '66, right?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You were with a host family in Cleveland?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Cleveland, Ohio.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Right.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes. I live with three families over there in Ohio.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: All right. Dad, what's your first memory of mom?Felix Fraga: It was two good people coming to do field work in Houston and at our agency, I felt an honor for the agency and I didn't get a chance to think too much beyond that.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: So can you just tell us, mum since you were in the program, tell us a little about that program, you came in 1966.Nelly Moyano Fraga: [inaudible 00:11:36] international plan for social workers and youth leaders. I won that scholarship in [inaudible 00:11:43] after I finished my graduate school of social work. So I got the degree and I was working over there in Planned Parenthood in foster parent plan. I won the scholarship, I came to New York first where were a 180 from all over the world, we met there and then we went to Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. For my field work, I asked community work and neighborhood center ones, Houston was the best organization to have this program. So Giovanna from India and I, they told us that were going to be coming to Houston.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: That was the summer of '60-.Nelly Moyano Fraga: The summer of '66.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: June, July and August that you were here?Nelly Moyano Fraga: The first week of June and I met your father and he was always nice, inviting us different places and we saw the beautiful city that it was. It was small town really, Houston, it was not like it is now I can't believe it how much it grow, but it was very interesting and the program that they have, I was assigned to go to Clayton Homes.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: A housing project.Nelly Moyano Fraga: A housing project and it was very interesting, I thought when I saw some black people there, I thought they were the black people from Ecuador so I spoke to them in Spanish. They looked at me and said, ""I don't understand you. "" I said, ""Oh yeah, they don't speak Spanish."" I said to myself. So I started practicing my English with them and I found one family from Ecuador that was living there and there were many from Mexican descent, majority.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: All right.Nelly Moyano Fraga: So it was very interesting to work in the beautification.Felix Fraga: Beautification.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Program and we were in charge of helping them to clean up the area to look beautiful, and with the kids program, the educational program, and the mothers. Yeah, it was very interesting learning all these projects.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: That's interesting I do remember you said the perception of the idea that coming from Ecuador that when you think of America and who speaks English, that's the gringo right?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yeah.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: The blond and the blue eyed person. So '66 you were working at Ripley House then, right?Felix Fraga: Yes son.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: So you were assigned to go pick up mom and the social worker from India?Felix Fraga: Yes, son.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Can you tell us a little bit of that? You said, how long had the program been going on?Felix Fraga: For 10 years and this happen to be the last year of the program, I think because of funded limitations. But what I remember about the program was that there was these two of them and the lady from India was an administrator from her country. She'd been in social work for many years and your mother was just getting started.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yeah she was 23, young.Felix Fraga: [00:15:00] The other lady must have been in her maybe 40s even or late 30s. Anyway, she was really interested in finding out about administration and many things since she had a lot of questions. At some point, I forget when it was, your mother I don't say complained, but she mentioned to somebody or I heard somewhere that I was giving more attention to the other lady than to her. It was only because I was thinking about the agency and that this lady wanted more information and so I wanted to see if we could satisfy her need for information and question that she wanted, but I wasn't personally giving one more attention than the other.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You think mom was a little jealous?Felix Fraga: No.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Maybe, I don't know.Felix Fraga: It wasn't that kind of attention I was giving. I was just trying to answer her questions and information she needed.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: That was only three months that you were here in Houston.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes.Felix Fraga: I think it was three months, was it two and a half?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes, three months.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Three months. As the years would go by it becomes in a way more amazing how the two of you ended up getting married. Because the way I understand it, after the program was over the two of you didn't consider that you were even dating, right?Nelly Moyano Fraga: No, I don't know it's something very special really the relationship that we have brought. I didn't really want to fall in love with him because I had to go back to Ecuador, my parents and everybody was there.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You had feelings for him and that?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yeah, he likes me.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: There was an attraction?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes, and he was so nice with me and a gentleman always and be ready for me, but as I was going back to Guano, want to see him no more. I was not going to stay because I couldn't stay without the blessing of my parents, so I had to go back to Ecuador I never thought that he will be going there, I didn't see him that way. So what about you?Felix Fraga: Didn't your father wondered if there was anything between us and I had to get a lawyer to write a letter to say that I'd never-Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Oh really? I never heard of this before, this is interesting.Felix Fraga: Yeah.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yeah we were with friends I was saved, but you know how parents are. I was by myself over here.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Your dad asked?Nelly Moyano Fraga: No, he didn't ask but I don't know why he understood that way.Felix Fraga: Somebody asked me to get a letter to your dad.Nelly Moyano Fraga: I read it that everything was fine here, that I learned, all the program was great for everybody and all that, it was very interesting.Felix Fraga: Anyway I had sent letter to say that I had no personal or any kind of interests other than professional.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Okay. Were you attracted to mum though?Felix Fraga: I must have been.Nelly Moyano Fraga: What did you say the other day about the program that Mr. Herbert was saying?Felix Fraga: I have been working there for 15, 20 years and I wasn't married.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You were how old?Nelly Moyano Fraga: You were 37.Felix Fraga: Yeah, already that's right. Anyway, this program that we had vest in social workers and back then and even today most of the social workers are females. Every summer for two and a half months, we would have these feasts in social works usually but a group of about eight to 10 and they were usually all females. They would send the workers from the South American countries there, because we had a neighborhood where a lot of the recipients spoke Spanish.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Right, the East end.Felix Fraga: Some were limited in their English, so they would send them there and I was the only staff person that was bilingual at the time, I was given the assignment to chaperone these workers around. For two months I would walk around the agency or the neighborhoods surrounded by these visiting social workers sometimes all women, he used to tell the board members at the meetings that this was the find Felix a wife program, never knowing that it was going to work out.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: It was actually going to happen. When he would say that, how did you receive that?Felix Fraga: I just brushed it off.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Like it was just a joke.Felix Fraga: Yeah, the program wasn't for that.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: [00:20:00] Are you sure?Felix Fraga: Not really. I think he would just probably wonder when I was going to get married. I don't know.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yeah.Felix Fraga: The fact that I was always surrounded by women. That's what he said. That the point that it's a white program and she was in the last group.Nelly Moyano Fraga: That was the reason the last group. No, really. But it's something is special because my father passed away in January.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Of '67.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Sixty seven.Felix Fraga: Sixty eight.Nelly Moyano Fraga: No '67.Felix Fraga: Sixty seven.Nelly Moyano Fraga: I dream my father with Felix. Felix, you remember you told me that you dream with your mother with me?Felix Fraga: Yeah.Nelly Moyano Fraga: That was to me something special. I just met him almost three months and I dream with my father with him. It's like he accepted him, because my father saw his pictures in Ecuador when I took them.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: So if you were here in the Summer of '66 and your dad, my grandfather, died January '67.Nelly Moyano Fraga: January 1st.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Then you had that dream.Nelly Moyano Fraga: A couple of maybe in five or six months after he passed away, one day I dream with Felix with my father.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Well, so maybe 7-8 months after you met dad.Nelly Moyano Fraga: So to me was something special. Then he went to visit me, and that's when we got engaged. My friends in Ecuador said ""Oh, you're going to get married."" I say, ""How can you say that? He's coming to visit us."" People here, you told me, they were telling him that you are going to get married. He said the same thing, ""How?"" He doesn't know my answer and he didn't know me that much. But when he got here on October.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: October 1968.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Sixty eight. We decided to have a party because he was going to his birthday in New York. So we had a preparation for having his birthday party. At the end it was our engagement because a day before he asked me to marry him, he didn't know about his party so he asked me to marry him. So I accepted it, of course I don't know why but I was happy. I accepted to marry him. We had this celebration, the priest, Father Gaetano came to our home and blessed the rings and we said we're going to get married in January. He said he going to be there. I said, ""Okay. January 25th."" We got married in '69, and it has been 40 great years. Wonderful. I have learned my love for you Gary has been growing little by little. You must know there's love that you see each other every day, and go dating all the time. So it's something special.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yeah.Nelly Moyano Fraga: We are 40 years in marriage. We're going 41 this coming January.Felix Fraga: That's right.Nelly Moyano Fraga: So it has been wonderful and I love this country so much because it gave me this good opportunity to have my husband and to have my three kids. Two sons alive and doing a lot of something that I love here in Houston. To do my social work in the community. To me I haven't left Ecuador because I always live in area where it is mainly Hispanics, and I have always spoke Spanish.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Right.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Even when I came the first time, I remember you invited me when I went with the neighborhood centers, we went to another area, Houston. It was all white people. Remember? I was always in this area, at the essence, I was always with Spanish speaking. Going over there, I said, ""Oh my God, now I feel like I'm in USA."" Because that's what we said in gringos in Ecuador, and we loved them and of course they're nice people, so I said, ""Oh, now I feel like I'm in USA."" Because before I was in my neighborhood, I feel like in Ecuador.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Dad, so when you went down to Ecuador in 1968, and you hadn't seen mom since she left, right?Felix Fraga: No.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Did you have an idea you're going to ask her to marry you? Had you made up your mind? When did you?Felix Fraga: I think while I was there.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: While you were there?Felix Fraga: I didn't have any idea what was going to happen from this trip. Excuse me.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Why did you go?Felix Fraga: I think I wanted to see her, and the Olympics were going on in Mexico, so I stopped by Mexico first and then went on to Ecuador.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: [00:25:00] So is that the story that your mother, I believe [inaudible 00:25:06] answered the phone one day that he called. Was it the very first phone call that he made that she answered?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yeah. We didn't have no phone because there's no line going into my neighborhood, so when we got it, I sent a letter saying that we have the phone number giving him the letter and so he called, and I think that the second or maybe third phone call, I don't quite remember.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: But it wasn't the first phone call?Nelly Moyano Fraga: No, I don't think so. My mother answered and she said, ""Oh, you know, you have been calling, why don't you come? We like to meet you. Can you come to visit us?"" He right away said, ""I'll be there,"" He answered, ""I'll be there.""Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Do you remember that conversation with her?Felix Fraga: Somewhat, yeah.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: But she invited you down?Felix Fraga: Yeah. I don't know if I would have gone if it hadn't been an invitation of the mother.Nelly Moyano Fraga: So he came, and all my family fall in love with him. As soon as he was walking down from the airplane, coming from the plane to the building at the airport. They like him in the way that he was smiling, so friendly from the beginning, so they liked him very much. I said, ""Don't get excited, this is just my friend."" Here I am 40 years. You know that in.Felix Fraga: We're still friends.Nelly Moyano Fraga: We're still good friends and all my family is in Ecuador, my brothers, I'm glad that they are coming to visit us next month.That will be nice.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Dad, so when you said that going down to Ecuador, that you wanted to see mom, that you wanted to see her, remind me and I've only heard this once before and maybe you'll tell the same story. But what was it like for you? Because when these visiting social workers came like mom, they lived at Ripley house at the community center, right on second floor. What was it like for you when she left, you went into a room?Felix Fraga: Yes.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Can you talk about it?Felix Fraga: Well, just the beds were all bare, you might say. I don't know, I was thinking, ""Gosh, here's the end of another group that had come and gone."" Before I never saw the other ones ever again. So I said, ""Gosh, maybe I won't get to see her anymore."" Something along those lines.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Yeah.Felix Fraga: But it was a sad feeling to see the room completely bare, the beds and all that. Because I've never visited any of the others over the 10 year period. This is my first visit to a former worker that had been there.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You ended up getting married. But you did go on to Washington, DC, right? Because the program had its final ceremony in Washington.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Right, and Doctor Henry [inaudible 00:28:12] who was the director of that program came to Houston to see how we were doing. So he met Felix and well he already know Mr Herbert But he invited Felix because he was nice with him to invite places here. So he said, ""You go to Washington too."" He invited him to the ceremony, ""You're welcome."" So he went there to Washington, to the end of the program. He participated at the dinner that we had with her. Then I said I'm going to New York because I haven't seen really New York when I came the first time, and he said, ""I'm going with you."" So here I am going to New York to see my relatives. The first time when I came from Ecuador, when I flew the first time I was coming, my relative were to see me, my friends, and I was crying all the way on the plane. I was so upset, leaving home because it was my first time coming here, at 23 years old leaving house. So I was so upset, and they helped me to overcome my feelings.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: You said it was cold.Nelly Moyano Fraga: It was cold for me.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: It was Winter.Nelly Moyano Fraga: It was Spring.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Okay. It was spring.Nelly Moyano Fraga: In April, and then he and I are going back to New York to see them. Here I'm coming by myself, unhappy and here I'm coming with a man. Right there walking outside. I thought, ""Oh my God, I didn't."" [inaudible 00:29:37]Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Your cousin saw something right?Nelly Moyano Fraga: My Family they look at me and I introduce my friend and all that. So but he went there and stayed in YWCA or something right there, my family lives in New York, my good friends, and said, ""We'll see you later."" He knows everything, of course he speaks [00:30:00] the language. So we went at home a few minutes, he was knocking the door, he already left his baggage over there, and he came to spend time with us. So I believe I will thank you for doing all that.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: What are the things that you've done together? What things are there any specific projects or things that stand out that you've done together in the community?Felix Fraga: Well, the folk dancing group is probably the greatest contribution that she's been part of and I have helped her to bring about, because it's a great activity for the community. I think you've heard me tell how our boss was marveled at one time he went out to the west side of town where there were no Hispanics and he saw the reaction of the non Hispanics to this Hispanic folk dancing group and he thought it was a great opportunity to bring the two groups together because, at that time Houstan was very much divided ethnically and culturally, you might say the west side, it was all one way and the east side was another way. They never seem to get together and he thought this was great and he was right. I think the more that we get one group to known each other group think better. They'll, accept and like each other. Am glad I have been part of at least of course, had the lead on that, but I'll just supporting a person to that thing for done together. That's probably the one that I think is going to have the lasting good for the community.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: What about for you mom?Nelly Moyano Fraga: To me the other program that has been great is the one that you had the idea to start with the police department learning Spanish.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Learning conversation Spanish.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Thank you to the [inaudible 00:32:17] who put it together with the [inaudible 00:32:19] leadership and became good and go and practices Spanish with the police officers and you too, you and Carlos volunteered, and there was another thin gray, because like you said before, with the folkloric learning, all these white people and black people and Chinese learning the Spanish. That is great because people new more about the other and they were not afraid of the police, because there are people who want to help, they want to be friends, but they have to enforce the law. So that was great, this program started that's one of those things that are really, admire though and then they started with the fire department too, so learning the language or learning the dances and is wonderful. It's wonderful makes us be better.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: What's been the most challenging or difficult experience that the two of you shared encountered together?Nelly Moyano Fraga: The difficult is when we can not help people with the immigration papers, when people asked for help and we can avoid that far in just to see we can be patient and wait for a good change or the system.Felix Fraga: I think the other one of course is, we need to make a greater effort, or more successful effort of making sure that our young people, particularly in low-income neighborhoods complete their education. I think that's one of the greatest problems we face is that a high drop out rate that we have in our low income areas Hispanic. Half of the kids that start the first grade never finish their high school education, we just got to work a little bit harder at that.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Mommy you mentioned of feeling very blessed, very fortunate, and thankful for the life that you've had hear in the US for 40 years and you mentioned three children, Fernando being the oldest, passed away in 1974. Can you talk about that? Imagine personally, definitely at a personal level, that must be the most difficult experience of the two of you have faced in your marriage?Nelly Moyano Fraga: Yes. That was worse, is still is there but not like it used to be very sad, painful. [00:35:00] You died and there you are surviving. But the time is the only one that really helps a lot and to be working with in the community, helping others and helping yourself because that's the way, you'll get busy and you forget your pains or your problems, and you are really focusing the others, and I'm so glad that was a hard time for us and I thank God the way that He did it because he bless us the way He did. Fernando didn't suffer that much, he was gone right away and he lived my hands free to do something more or so, I thank you for that, and I think him for you because you are back to our Houston, our home and I really thank you for that to a lad, at least we have you because Carlos I don't think that he would becoming in down from. He loves where he loves the mountains that's where he loves to live. But I am glad you are here. This year has been a very blessing in having you coming back after 17 years.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Right.Nelly Moyano Fraga: You went to college and university, you got your degree, you had been working on with their own Sandy's Missouri, so I'm very happy that you are hearing, you are with us.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: ThanksFelix Fraga: [inaudible 00:36:30] is also very happy to have you.Nelly Moyano Fraga: That's another blessing to see you working in the same position that you father used to be, and even is unbelievable to me. I cant believe it because see how your father has to go through and here you are after so many years, you are coming right away to the position your father has to go from different steps for you because he has a lot of discrimination in Houston, and so your father really had to work hard and thanks God he was a director, in navel center here you're applying now for this 2009, and you are getting the job right away, and not that you have a lot of experience, so you're really deserve the position, but it's not like it used to be for now, I'm so glad.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Thanks, I'm really happy to be back. Well, I want to thank the two of for taking the time, I just thought this was a great opportunity to record your voices and hear your stories, and I'm glad to be back home too. Thank you.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Thank you. We love you.Felix Fraga: We also want to thank the group.Bolivar Moyano Fraga: Story Core.Felix Fraga: Yes. I think it's a great idea, and I hope people take advantage of this wonderful opportunity that they give us.Nelly Moyano Fraga: Thank you.",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
MBY006076,"Rick: [00:00:00] My name is Rick Heysquierdo, I'm 50 years old. Today's date is December 19, 2009. We're in Houston, Texas at Discovery Green, and I'm going to be speaking to my son Noel.Noel: My name is Noel Heysquierdo. I am 15 years old. Today is December 19, 2009. We are in Houston, Texas, and I'm going to be interviewing my dad.Rick: Okay. Are you nervous, Noel?Noel: A little bit.Rick: A little bit. Well, you've been on the radio with me before, but you were little bitty when you used to come on. But you and I have talked about doing this and I know that maybe you didn't understand why I wanted to do this. I was talking to you earlier in the week or how -- Even though you live with your mom, I always feel like I was forcing you -- that you have to spend time with me this holiday season.Noel: Yeah. I don't mind it.Rick: Well, I know but it's hard being a -- I don't call myself a single dad, but it's hard being the way you live with your mom, and, of course, I have my house, she has her house.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I think sometimes, how come you and I struggle sometimes is that we don't -- Even though we talk every morning, we talk every afternoon, every night, and you know that after a while when we're around each other a couple hours, it's cool.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I just wanted to make sure to let you know that, even though you're not over at the house all the time, I'm always thinking about you.Noel: Yes, same here. All right, you want to go ahead and get started?Rick: Yeah. Let's talk.Noel: All right. What did you think you were going to be when you grew up?Rick: I say this sometimes as a lesson is I don't know what the hell I'm doing as a dad. You hear people say there's no instruction book, and, I think, first of all, I never thought I was going to be a dad.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I'll tell you that much. I had never planned on having children and any of that. I was happy-go-lucky and met your mom, and, of course, all of that freaked me out. But it is what it is and it's cool.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Especially where you are right now, you're a young adult. But getting back to what you asked me, growing up we really didn't have anything. There was 12 of us. We were poor but I didn't know we were poor.Noel: Yeah.Rick: When you don't have anything, you don't know you don't have anything. There was never that thought, I don't think anyone ever asked me, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" I don't ever remember anybody, how I'm on you about getting your schoolwork done, and making sure that you're preparing and habits and lessons.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I've been very lucky to have been successful as I am in life. So, what did I want to be when I grew up? I had no idea. I'm 50 years old, and well, I don't know what I want to be now. I think I'm fairly successful at work. I've been all over the world a few times. I've been a successful radio DJ in Houston for years, interviewed some of the best musicians that are my heroes, Johnny Cash, crazy people like Bonnie Raitt or Lyle Lovett or Little Joe Washington here in town. It's just crazy as hell. But have you thought about -- I know and I'm afraid to hear the answer, what do you want to be when you grow up?Noel: I'm really not sure. I'm only 15, still got a few years until I really need to start getting everything together, but I have no idea. Just hope it turns out nice, well.Rick: You do understand all that. I guess you know where I'm going with this, what's the foundation of this?Noel: You think I want to be a musician when I grow up, which would be awesome, but I'm not going to fall. That'll be -- I guess --That's not my fallback.Rick: Yeah. So the foundation is what?Noel: I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm working on my education right now.Rick: There you go. Can we get a drum roll on that? Well, I want you to ask me -- I think we talk at each other. We don't really sometimes, I think, talk. I mean, do you have any underlying questions you want to know about my life and growing up with momo, and we just lost my mom, your grandma.Noel: Yeah.Rick: [00:05:00] Obviously, that's been hard. But I think what's been harder is how my family has questioned whether or not Ricky was always in it for the money. There was no money.Noel: Yeah.Rick: If it wasn't for me, mom would not have had the life she had. So, I think that's just been the hardest part for me and especially fighting in court now. I've got that court battle and that really sucks, but luckily I have a good team of lawyers, so that helps.Noel: All right. Well, I guess we'll move on to what was the happiest moment of your life?Rick: I think the cliche would be, when you were born.Noel: Yeah.Rick: But I can tell you what though, that's probably the scariest moment. I'll tell you. I'll be honest with you Noel, I don't know if I've ever been happy.Noel: Happy?Rick: Seriously, I don't know if I've ever really, really been happy, and I think this gets back to where I was trying to go with this earlier. Just a note I made to myself about relationships. Because, you know, it's -- I don't know.Noel: So, what lessons have you learned from your relationships?Rick: Well, sometimes I think we get in these habits where I keep going back. That's why I have it rotating, a revolving door with women. But one thing, you're one constant in my life as far as relationships go. Obviously me dating women, is different than me having a son. But they do have a parallel, juxtaposition that you and I are stuck with each other. So, we've got to figure out some way to make this work.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I think we have, and I think about your mom. She's sick right now.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I think about, what if you have to come live with me? Obviously we will make that work and we'll figure it out. But I'm sure that's got to be -- You've got to be as apprehensive as I am on that.Noel: Yeah. All right. Well, we're going to move on.Rick: What are you thinking, the library or what?Noel: Let me see.Rick: Is there any questions about my childhood or anything?Noel: We've talked about each other before. About the funny little stories about how you sent in all those cereal boxes to get that golden dollar.Rick: It was a Kennedy half dollar, I thought I had -- and I held on to that thing. I think I slept with that damn thing. I never had 50 cents. Then we went down to this, Piggly Wiggly, and it's the first time I had ever stepped -- Back then they didn't have the motion sensors on the doors, you would actually step on the pad and the doors would open. That guy ran us off throwing rocks at us because we kept stepping on it just amazed that this door would open. This was pre-Star Trek. It was freaky. One other things, I don't know if I've ever told you about when we were growing up in Port Lavaca? We got hit by two major hurricanes. Hurricane Carla, Hurricane Beulah. I think Hurricane Beulah is the one that was in '64, I think. I had to be five I think. I remember when -- You know how freaky this last one was?Noel: Yeah.Rick: But it was really, in comparison to -- We didn't have a flood in the Houston area, but I remember we were scared to death. We were just kids. Obviously, mom was probably, I didn't even factor in that fact, how scared she had to be. But being picked up off the roof of our house, the water was that high, by a National Guard in bass boats, and all of us kids, covered in ants.Noel: Wow. Yeah. I've never heard that before.Rick: Because the ants would float on water. I don't know how the hell we made it, starting over. A few times. You know, we didn't have any money. When I think about everything you have and how you keep wanting more and more, and I keep trying to ground you and tell you, ''I know. Don't give me that smirk.'' What?Noel: Like this guitar I just got, I contributed half. It's still awesome. You could say that.Rick: What? That's a lot of money for a 15 year old, to have a $1,200 [00:10:00] guitar.Noel: Yeah. I know. But I'm extremely excited about it, and I'm very grateful. Your radio show, the ""Lone Star Jukebox,"" how long have you been doing this?Rick: Eighteen years.Noel: Wow.Rick: I'm going to tell an embarrassing story about you, Noel.Noel: No.Rick: I was on the air interviewing Butch Hancock. I remember we were in a fun drive. I don't even think I was married to Leslie yet. You were little bitty. You had to be four, maybe. You come in the studio, and you see me on the air, and you don't know what's going on. And you come in and you're happy. I'm on a mic and you say, ''Daddy, I need to poop.'' So here we are, the city of Houston, and Butch Hancock looks at me and goes, ''You know, Rick. Nothing works until that happens.'' Needless to say, the phone lines rang big time. We got lots of money for that line. You've been on the air with me when I interviewed you and your brother Tucker?Noel: Yeah. That was really fun.Rick: The only problem is trying to find an interview.Noel: So, does it ever get maybe a little bit tedious?Rick: As hard as I work, Monday through Friday, flying every week somewhere and getting on airplanes every week, then coming home and doing the show on Saturday, yeah. I did. I literally work six days a week. I don't know how many times I wanted to cash in and not do the show anymore, and just when I don't want do the show anymore, Noel, somebody calls up and says something really nice. Literally, when I'm just done, I can't do it again. Then that carries me for another six months.Noel: So, speaking of that, when do you think you might retire?Rick: From the radio show?Noel: Yeah, sorry. From the radio show.Rick: I don't know, man? I don't know. You know, Buck is leaving next year.Noel: Yeah.Rick: So I'm going to have to bring in a new --Noel: Barney had already left -- what was it?Rick: Yeah. Barney left years -- So I don't know if I have it in me to train another person. But I also feel like I'll be leaving. It's a good gig, what comes with doing the radio show. Let me ask you a question, tell me, when your mom mentioned that she was very sick, what were your thoughts on that?Noel: I was just pretty scared, because I didn't know much about anything that she had told me. I was just nervous. Just definitely, everyone's been helping out, just having friends and family has definitely just helped out. I mean, she's doing well right now. The chemo is making her feel really well.Rick: She told me this week. I mean, it was a fleeting moment, she said that she -- I talked to her last night, I think, before I talked to you. She thinks she felt good for one day, the best she's ever felt in her entire life. I don't know what kind of euphoria that is.Noel: She didn't know that she's been sick for a while, but she just found out about it. So, just this chemo, she probably does feel great. I'm glad but I've heard it's going to be on and off like that. One day, it's the best she's ever felt, another day, it's the worst.Rick: It is. It's going to get worse before it gets better. Do you think you and Tucker are being good sons? Good stewards of that?Noel: I hope so. We are trying to help out as much as we can. Especially now, right around Christmas. It's the toughest time that this probably could've happened, but we're just trying not to pressure her. Hopefully this will be a great Christmas for the family.Rick: A lot of her friends have come back to her life. She had lost a lot of friends there, for whatever reason that was.Noel: Well, no, she just didn't stay in contact. It happens.FEMALE_1: What are you afraid of?Noel: Well, quite frankly, I'm afraid I just might lose her. But I'm just hoping for the best.Rick: What does that mean, Noel?Noel: In a lot of ways. Not necessarily death, but just lose contact with her. Because if she gets too sick, I don't mind taking care of her, but we won't have deep conversations or have fun together and play around.Rick: You think your brother feels the same way?Noel: I'm not sure. We haven't [00:15:00] really discussed it in depth.Rick: Have you guys talked? Because I talked to Tucker the other day and asked him if you guys had talked.Noel: We actually haven't. It's a --Rick: It's a scary thing to talk about. You haven't said it yet, but your mom has cancer and that's hard to say. It scares the hell out of me. I wish we had a brush that we could make it go away, and I don't know what's going to happen, Noel. But I do think that we all have to step up and just do what we have to do. Not do what's expected of us, but do what we feel is -- She's your mom. She and I had a relationship. We were never married, but we got you out of the deal. That ain't too bad.Noel: Yes. Back to the relationship question. You have been married twice? How was that?Rick: The first one, it really -- And Nancy and I are still good friends. It's really -- Probably wasn't even a marriage, you know. It was so short. But as you know, Alan and I are probably better friends than she and I. I don't know, man. I don't think I'm a good husband.Noel: How's that?Rick: It's just tough being married. I think I was a good guy. It's just a tough situation, especially with Leslie making statements at the end that she didn't want any part of this. And then she goes, right after the divorce, she goes off and gets married and has a kid.Noel: Yeah, that's pretty weird.Rick: As that freaked you out, and it also pissed me off that she made contact with you after many years via Facebook.Noel: Yeah.Rick: That wasn't cool. Just like being married to me, basically you're in the same boat. How do we make this work? We can't divorce each other. So, what do we do? That's why I looked forward so much, Noel, to all our summer trips and that one trip that threw us off with Clayton.Noel: Oh, yeah.Rick: I mean, not that -- It was just somebody was in the picture, and it was just that you and I are always doing a lot of driving in the West or whatever.Noel: Yeah.FEMALE_1: What are some of your favorite memories from your summer trips together?Rick: Remember this guy?Noel: We've got some really good ones. Just great bonding experience.Rick: A lot of driving, you know.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Which is cool.Noel: Oh, that's part of the bonding. Just stuck in the car for hours and hours. You've got to do something.Rick: I think my right arm still hurts where you punched me all those hours.Noel: I remember that.Rick: That was fun, when we took your brother. That time to Colorado?Noel: Yeah, that was a while ago.Rick: Remember that Pizza Hut we stopped at?Noel: Was that New Mexico, right?Rick: New Mexico. I can't go to Pizza Hut anymore after that.Noel: Nastiest place ever.Rick: A kid picking his nose and eating right out the salad bar. What about, remember that guy we met up at Lake Superior who ran at -- at golf, putt putt golf?Noel: Yeah, that was most rugged, beat up mini golf course. The loops were made out of tires and stuff.Rick: Yeah.Noel: We actually had fun, though.Rick: Well, of course. It doesn't matter. I think it's cool that -- Because, you know, hell, he didn't have money.Noel: Yeah.Rick: What did we pay? Two bucks each? Three bucks each then you stole his pencil? That's cold blooded.Noel: All right. Let's talk a little bit about your work. Can you go into depth about what you do?Rick: I work for the C.I.A., Noel. No, I've been in the dental business all my career and in sales, and then I had my own company for years, and now I've been doing what I do as a consultant even though I'm on payrolls, different companies. I think people think I have such an easy job because all I do is fly around and have dinners and lunches with people. But a lot of it is convincing them to sign multi-million dollar deals. So, I'm selling companies to clients, different companies and I don't really touch dental products or anything. But I don't know. Does it make any sense. I don't even know if I know I do, Noel.Noel: I have trouble explaining what you do to my friends. So, how's constantly flying every week, just going to a new city?Rick: [00:20:00] Noel, it's like getting up every Saturday to do this radio show I do. You just put one foot in front of the other. If I have to think of traveling, then it ruins me. I just do it. Thank God for iPhones and trip alerts from Continental because some days I don't even know where I'm going the next day. I had 63 round trips this year, and I'm so tired.Noel: Do you have any favorite stories from your work life? Maybe something that happened that was pretty funny on just one of your trips?Rick: It's a PG show, son. No, I don't know. I've met a lot of interesting people. It was a funny story. This was right after 9-11. What year was 9-11?Noel: Two thousand one, I think. Two thousand?Rick: It was the year after that. So it was probably February, whatever. No, it was summer, because I was actually flying to meet you and Leslie in Indianapolis. We were taking a trip through the Midwest there. I'm going through security, and there's this huge black man in front of me in this orange suit. I don't think anything of it. We're both getting loaded on the plane first. We were flying first-class. And they pulled him off to the side for additional screening. I didn't think anything of it. Then I realize, that's George Foreman. What the hell do they think? He's got a grill that he's trying to sneak on this airplane? So, he finally gets through, and we're sitting next to each other. His two boys, George, are sitting in front of us. I think there was only two seats -- two rows in that first-class center cabin. So his two boys, I'm watching, they pull out their college textbooks and whatever, and George Foreman pulls out a Jet magazine. It was this National Enquirer and all of these, and I'm thinking, ""You know what? It doesn't matter. George sold 100 million grills. He doesn't need to read the Wall Street Journal, but it was funny."" He didn't say one word to me on that airplane until it landed, and then he got into his George Foreman mode, started pulling photos out, and signing them. He went from -- [snap] turned on a dime to being the guy that he is on TV.Rick: What else have I wanted to ask you, Noel? I'm on the road every week. I've told you one of the things that holds us together is trust, and I really need you to know that when you tell you're going to do something, that if you go around me and don't do it, Noel, I mean, we don't see each other that much, and even though we live a mile away from each other, geographically, it's close, but as much as I'm on the road and now you're getting to the point where you're going to start driving. And, you know, I got my hair cut last night, yesterday, and Robert was telling me that his son is going to be 17 or 18,  doesn't want to do anything with him anymore. And it's like, ""Well, I guess kids pull away."" I don't remember that age. Because, I guess, I had nothing to pull away from. Mom was always busy working, trying to put food on the table. So, I don't know. Well, I forgot what you asked me.Noel: You asked. That's what you asked me.Rick: Did I ask you?Noel: Yeah.Rick: Do you ever think about momo, Noel?Noel: Yeah, I do a lot.Rick: What do you think?Noel: We had really good times together.Rick: Tell me about one of you bingo stories, because she used to love to take you to bingo.Noel: Yeah, that was fun. We never won, but that did not matter at all.Rick: Mom wouldn't need to win?Noel: Well, I thought one of the funniest things is I would just have one, two tops, just cards that they use, and she would just have like 12, and it would be insane. She'd spend $50 just on the cards alone. She was pro, definitely. She was -- It was a sport or something. She would have those blotters like crazy and she'd be done while I was still asking a question about what does this mean and that?Rick: Do you remember when -- Did I ever show you that copy of when [00:25:00] you guys got -- I thought it was silly -- your picture on the Bingo Daily or Bingo Weekly?Noel: Yeah, I read about that.Rick: She said that I guess they spun the story differently. You guys were big winners and momo said, ""We didn't win a damn thing. They're liars."" Betty won a lot. Momo never did win at bingo. But it's like anything else. It's just a sport. What am I trying to say? An event.Noel: A hobby?Rick: A hobby, yeah.Noel: Yeah, it didn't really matter that we never won. Just had a lot of fun.Rick: One thing that you haven't had is any real contact or a relationship with your cousins. I don't know. I think it's because my brothers are all so weird. Remember, they say I'm weird too?Noel: Yeah.Rick: I don't know. Is that something you want to do? Because you've got some pretty cool cousins.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Marisol, Saint Thomas, brilliant kid.Noel: Yeah.Rick: I don't know. I guess you can't pick your family. I'm stuck.Noel: Yeah, me too.FEMALE_1: What are some of you favorite memories of Noel when he was small? What was he like?Rick: Well, I remember the first time that you realized -- We were laying in bed and we were just playing. I think I had just finished changing you or something, and we were playing around. And the first time you realized that when you were saying something, it's actually coming out of your mouth. In other words, you realize you had the capability to say, you know -- And all it was was like, ""Eee,"" and you kept saying it over and -- Because I was laughing and then we got momo on the phone, on a speaker phone. And whatever I was doing, all you kept doing was doing this shriek. It must have going on for an hour, dude, because you were amazing yourself that this was coming out of your mouth.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Right after that, you rolled off the bed and bounced. So I'm thinking, oh my God, C.P.S. is going to come get me, and then you looked up, and you did that shriek again. And I said, ""All right, I guess his brain is okay."" Wait, you remember when you were little, remember I used to love to watch boxing?Noel: Yeah.Rick: I still do. But before I had that room, that was used to be the bedroom, where the TV room now is, before I got that built out. Remember, you used to get those remote control cars and write notes on them and remote control the car over to me, you know, ""Dad, your feet stink,"" or, ""Dad, there's a monster on your head.""Noel: Yeah. I used to remember that.Rick: I still have all those notes.Noel: Really?Rick: You know what was funny, Noel, is when you -- I think you were helping me in the office one day, and you saw that huge file cabinet. I have those big cabinets. You saw all those papers, and I remember you were saying -- you said something to me like, ""You keep these things?"" You know, and all the poems you've written, and I keep encouraging you to write that. I mean, you're such a great guitar player and you may or may not think you have a good voice. I don't know, but I think a good writer as you are, that you should pursue some of that. Because I don't know, it scares me to think that you want to be a rock and roll guy, because I'm around these guys all the time, and I just want to make sure that you have a fallback. And I say things to you like, ""Well, when you're in college, you're on your own,"" but of course you're not on your own. But I do need you to know that you've got to step up and take responsibility. I mean, I'll always help you, but -- what the heck was that?Noel: Popped my neck really quick.Rick: But, you know what's interesting is I think about your childhood and I don't remember any of my childhood.Noel: Really?Rick: Up to, I think the earliest memory I have is second grade.Noel: Wow.Rick: And I think -- And I'm thinking, maybe it's because they were pretty traumatic times, you know, having to move around a lot and getting hit by two hurricanes. Even at that age, I knew we didn't have money. I remember the boys -- there was a Boy Scout leader, came around a couple of years in a row to ask us what we wanted for Christmas, and I was always conscious of it, thinking ""Well, if I ask for something then somebody else won't get anything."".Noel: Yeah.Rick: And I never asked for anything, but I always got something. The one thing I did ask for one year, and [00:30:00] I actually had this flashback on the air one day, somebody had asked me how long I've been doing that. And I got to thinking, and then I just had this flashback. I don't remember the age. I had to be maybe 10. I had been asking for a recorder, because I would be watching ""The Johnny Cash Show"" or ""The Porter Wagoner Show,"" all these shows on TV, fascinated by them. And for one Christmas, I got a reel-to-reel. It was a small reel-to-reel. I mean, it was probably 12 inches by 10 inches and this was way before this whole digital revolution. I would go around and pretend I was interviewing Johnny Cash, put the recorder over the television. So, I guess I've had this music thing in me a long time, and even though you, [inaudible 00:30:58], don't think that I have had any influence on you musically, I think through osmosis it has. Do you think I've had any influence musically on you?Noel: To the music that I currently listen to now? No.Rick: What about the core? Does your core, why you love music? Do you know, I've told you this, that when your mom was giving birth to you, the song that -- Because this was way before iPods and all that, I actually brought a little stereo in there. They let me do this. Tish Hinojosa and Peter Rowan, were playing this song called ""Caribbean"" and right when your head crested -- And it's funny because I've actually done this just without you even realizing it. I played that song for you, and without telling you.Noel: Yeah.Rick: And I don't know if I just convinced myself that you remember that, because it's silly. But you've been listening to music since the minute you took your first breath.Noel: Yeah. I mean, I definitely remember that you've shown me some good music, definitely. You listen to a lot of good music.Rick: Who's the man?Noel: Johnny Cash.Rick: There you go.Noel: But I guess you have. But like I said, the music that I currently listen to, not so much. I've actually introduced you to --Rick: No, I think that's cool. Because I didn't know who Buckethead was.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Remember when we went to see him? I was going to do the drop off. I was going to drop you off and grab a couple of beers and come back and get you. And I went holy cow. This guys is.Noel: You said he's the best guitarist you've ever seen.Rick: To this day, I -- That's a conviction I will go down with. I have never seen a guitarist like that.Noel: Yeah. He's phenomenal.Rick: I've see Eric Clapton. I've seen some of the best.Noel: Yeah.Rick: So, what do you think? You win or what? We have only a few minutes left, Noel. Do you -- I just want -- The reason I wanted to do this, and I've told you why this was important to me, even though this is going to be at the Library of Congress, that didn't mean anything to me. I'm on a radio every day, every week, but I need you to know that -- how much I care and love you, Noel, and I know I'm hard on you sometimes. I know I am, but, dude, I don't know what the hell I'm doing. But I just need you to know at the core, no matter how much of a jerk I can be that day, I go back and I realize, ""What the hell did I just say?"" or, ""Why did I do that?"" I know sometimes I bug you, because I call you immediately because I'm feeling bad about it. I don't know how to do this. I'm on-the-job training, O.J.T., but you're a good boy, and I tell people all the time how good of a kid you are. Of course, every time I meet with your teachers, they all say how polite you are, but these are the years I need you to step up, Noel. We need to get ready for college.Noel: Yeah.Rick: You're becoming a young man, and it scares me that -- I don't know. It just scares me you're getting older. You're shaving. Not often enough, but you're shaving.Noel: Yeah.Rick: So you know what you're getting for Christmas, right? So, I don't know. What about you, before we close on this?Noel: Actually, one thing I've wanted to ask you is, what is probably the most important lesson you've ever learned throughout your life?Rick: To be on time.Noel: That's a pretty good lesson. And I can definitely tell you try to push that onto me too.Rick: I have never been late for an appointment in my life. [00:35:00] You have to be on time. It shows that you respect the other person's time, and the level of business I deal in, the big deals that I'm doing, you have to be on time. And you know how I bust on you about, I mean, look at my house. I am a little anal about how clean it is and how the beds are made every day. And I don't know if that's part of the Air Force training or whatever. I don't think it is. I think it's just being grateful that I have a damn bed.Noel: Yeah.Rick: Dude, I slept with three of us in a bed growing up. I never had my own room, never ever ever. So I think a lot of that is just being grateful that I do have a bed, and that's why I get on you about picking clothes up. And what do I always tell you? Habits. Habits. Habits.Habits. You've got to make good habits. I'm trying to teach you how to be a good man in spite of your Farrah Fawcett haircut.Noel: That's your fault.Rick: Dude, I did not tell her to cut it like that. It'll grow out. Your dad's hair won't, but yours will.Noel: I'll give you some extensions.Rick: Well, I'm glad we did this Noel.Noel: Yeah, thanks. It was nice.Rick: I think we're done.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
MBY006112,"FEMALE_1: [00:00:00] Here we go.Laura Murphy: Oh, Laura Murphy, I'm 56 years old. It's January 15th, 2010. This is in Yuma, Arizona and I'm interviewing my aunt.Henrietta Green Leone: I'm Henrietta Green Leone. I'm 81 years old. Today's January 15th, 2010 in Yuma, Arizona and I'm being interviewed by my niece.Laura Murphy: Okay. Let's start at the beginning auntie. You have got the best nicknames in the whole world [inaudible 00:00:46] you just said outside. My favorite one is Lemons. How did you get your nickname Lemons?Henrietta Green Leone: Lemons, I got it from my neighbor that we had, my mother's neighbor. Well, our neighbor and she had a beautiful lemon tree, and when I was little, I used to go over and steal her lemons and she called me Lemons.Laura Murphy: But now, you know Mrs. Dennis, she would have just given you those lemons. Why did you steal them? Was it easier?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, I don't know. It was just something to do. It tasted better being stolen, I guess. I don't know.Laura Murphy: How did uncle Chinny, why did she call him Chinny?Henrietta Green Leone: Because since he was little, I guess he had been a tight wad since when he was little, and Chinny or Shinny is a Jewish word for someone who was very frugal, and that's he.Laura Murphy: That's a nice one. That's a nice way to put what he is, it's very good. So just in the family though, they never really went outside the family, those two nicknames.Henrietta Green Leone: No. We were called that Teetee and Chinny by our family. Mostly brothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles.Laura Murphy: Teetee was just an abbreviation of Henrietta?Henrietta Green Leone: I really don't know. I really don't know how that came about.Laura Murphy: Nobody ever told you?Henrietta Green Leone: Nobody ever told me and I didn't even bother to ask.Laura Murphy: Okay. Then you said outside before the interview that my dad called you onion head?Henrietta Green Leone: No. He called me a pealed onion because I had wore braids, and my mother used to braid our hair very tight. So my hair was just pushed back and I looked like an onion head or a pealed onion.Laura Murphy: So you knew my dad growing up then?Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, yes. I remember him. When I was little, not little, little, but maybe 10-12 years old.Laura Murphy: Were you surprised when my mom started dating him?Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, yeah. I thought gee, that's neat. I like him.Laura Murphy: Oh, really? I know he was always your favorite and stuff. What do you remember about growing up being a twin? Was it kind of unusual you being a twin or were there a lot of others?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, in school, I remember one set of twins, Geraldine and Joey Dortey in Catholic school at LIC. In high school, there were the [inaudible 00:03:39] Fellers and Gallagher. I don't know offhand who else, but there were about three or four sets of twins in the high school, while we were in high school.Laura Murphy: What do you think people remember about you in high school? Although I think I know the answer to that one.Henrietta Green Leone: Gee, I don't know. I guess I was well liked in high school. I was very active. I was president of the Girls League Association and probably the first Hispanic girl that was ever in Pep Club.Laura Murphy: Really?Henrietta Green Leone: So I was active.Laura Murphy: Why was it so hard for Hispanics? Did they just not go to high school or?Henrietta Green Leone: No. I don't think it, because a lot of Hispanics went to high school. Hispanic girls went to high school. I don't know. It was just understood somehow. I don't really know why.Laura Murphy: But you were the first one that chose.Henrietta Green Leone: I was the first and then afterwards, that was in the Pep Club. That was in-group.Laura Murphy: I see. I remember that we had and when I was in high school, it's a year before [00:05:00] I graduated. So that would've been 1970, was the first Hispanic Homecoming Queen.Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, really?Laura Murphy: Yeah. Bobby Padia. We all got together and voted as a block.Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, yeah.Laura Murphy: Because she very rarely had one been nominated to be Homecoming Queen. So when she got nominated, everybody met at lunch, ""You've got to vote for Bobby. You've got to vote for Bobby."".Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: So we all did and everybody was very excited when she got it.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. I remember, let's see, what was her name? Kano. Her first name slips my mind. She was a prince.Laura Murphy: A princess.Henrietta Green Leone: A princess or whatever they called them in those days. But she was nominated for but she was a freshman. She was like the freshman princess.Laura Murphy: But she didn't make it to senior year.Henrietta Green Leone: No.Laura Murphy: Yeah. That's too bad and stuff. Do you remember there being a lot of separation in Yuma between Hispanics? I know there wasn't between the Blacks but just from the Blacks and Hispanics, they seem to hang around together because just from our friends we had growing up that you introduced us to that.Henrietta Green Leone: No, not really. Because people would say, ""The Mexicans related to some."" Naughty people would call as Mexican grazers. So I'd answer right back. Well, with an an okie, whatever.Laura Murphy: Yeah.Henrietta Green Leone: But not really. If I were in a group and I was in a mixed group and they would talk about the Hispanics and they'd say, ""Well, we don't mean you Henrietta, because you can't tell you are."" So what the hell does a Hispanic personal look like?Laura Murphy: Because you were so whiter then? I mean White looking.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. I was complected. So they didn't.Laura Murphy: Okay. So do you think you had a different experience than my mom? Because she was so dark.Henrietta Green Leone: I don't know. I think.Laura Murphy: Now.Henrietta Green Leone: No. I don't know. I've had racial discrimination and I've lived through religious discrimination in the Ozarks and so I don't know. I was just ready to handle most anything that came my way.Laura Murphy: Came your way. I know and now, that's one reason that I wanted to interview you auntie. It is because in our family, you're considered a world traveler although I know you haven't really traveled out, but you didn't stay in Yuma and stuff that did. But let me ask you about this, is it true that you were discovered by Uncle Tony, like Lana Turner?Henrietta Green Leone: I don't think so. I never heard that story.Laura Murphy: No. Because my mom said that you were drinking in the soda fountain. A Rexol soda fountain when you met him or?Henrietta Green Leone: No. I was working at a drugstore which was connected by a soda fountain, a restaurant, a soda fountain, and all that was between those was a glass. He used to come in and buy shoe polish three days in a row. He buying brown shoe polish. and I thought, ""My God, what's this guy do with brown shoe polish?"" That cashier at the restaurant part of the building, I went to school with her. So he asked her to introduce us and that's how I met-Laura Murphy: My uncle.Henrietta Green Leone: But I had waited on him and knew who- I think I knew his name. I can't remember now. But anyway, I know who he was. So that was nice.Laura Murphy: He owned one of the historic hotels in Yuma, the Del Sol and stuff and he helped in running-Henrietta Green Leone: Yes. He and his sister owned the Del Sol Hotel. We were married in '48 and lived there until 1950 when he got called back to the Korean Conflict.Laura Murphy: Conflict and stuff. Did you enjoy running a hotel or?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, it was a lot of work and I never got paid. I never really got a salary. I was a maid. I was a clerk. I was doing a little bit of everything, the bookkeeper and when I get mad, I didn't do anything. But then when I got upset, that I felt I was being taken for granted. I quit working and then I would go back and have it all piled up.Laura Murphy: Eventually you got to do it.Henrietta Green Leone: YeahLaura Murphy: [00:10:00] Did anybody in the family help you with the hotel or?Henrietta Green Leone: No.Laura Murphy: No. That was just your business.Henrietta Green Leone: The thing I didn't like about it, neither uncle Tony nor I, was we would meet coming up and down the elevator. He'd be coming in from work at 8:00 o'clock in the morning if he had to work the night before and I'd be going down to work. We didn't like that.Laura Murphy: When uncle Tony was in the Korean War, hat's when you were pregnant with Cynthia? Or you were-Henrietta Green Leone: I was pregnant with Cynthia already, and Cynthia was born in Yuma in 1940, when was she born?Laura Murphy: '50.Henrietta Green Leone: No, '49 and he went to Korea.Laura Murphy: The year after?Henrietta Green Leone: In '50.Laura Murphy: What did you do when he went to Korea, did you stay here in Yuma?Henrietta Green Leone: I stay here in Yuma. Let's see, I worked for the marine corps, the air base. I was a civilian manager for the PX and I was there and then when he came back from the war, he decided he wanted to go back to school.Laura Murphy: So that's when he went to Missouri.Henrietta Green Leone: That's when we went to Missouri. But before he's decided he wanted to go back to school, we lived in La Jolla in California, San Diego in La Jolla. Then, he left there and then we went to Texas to San Antonio so he could go to graduate school.Laura Murphy: Oh, okay. So wait. So you were in Missouri and he graduated from school and then he went?Henrietta Green Leone: No. From Yuma, when he came back, he went to service, he went to Korea. He came back and he didn't know what he wanted to do. So I said, well, whatever, just make up your mind quick. He decided he wanted to go back. We moved to San Diego and he opened up an Indian Arts and Gift store in La Jolla, and we worked there. I didn't have anything to do with that, and so then I came back home, and I worked at the Marine's base airport and I was the manager of the PX there, the civilian manager. Then when he decided he wanted to go back to school, we went to San Antonio, Texas and he went to graduate school, graduated, and then we came back to Phoenix, and we were there five years.Laura Murphy: I remember that.Henrietta Green Leone: Then we went to Washington.Laura Murphy: Did you think that, growing up, that you would be living in so many different areas of the country?Henrietta Green Leone: No, I never thought of it.Laura Murphy: Would you have been happy just to stay in Yuma? Do you think?Henrietta Green Leone: I think eventually, I would have gone someplace. I don't know.Laura Murphy: What was it?Henrietta Green Leone: I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, that's the way it was.Laura Murphy: Because you just follow the husband? Do you ever wished that you had been able to go to school? I know you supported uncle Tony when he was in school.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Did you ever want to go back?Henrietta Green Leone: I wished I had gone back to school.Laura Murphy: What would you have studied if you have been in school?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, I ended up being an interpreter, and I think I would have been a teacher, working with handicapped children of some sort.Laura Murphy: Yeah.Henrietta Green Leone: Of some kind of handicap. But I married into a family that had deafness and so I just learned sign languageLaura Murphy: I always admired that you did learn to sign.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Because being an in-law, sometimes parents don't even learn the sign for their children.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: But you did just to talk to his brothers, so I always admired that you did that for him. Do you think it's enriched your life?Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, I think so. I think so. It certainly gave me different outlook on accepting people, different people with different lives.Laura Murphy: I know you when you were younger, you stayed with your grandmother a lot. Alice B, right?Henrietta Green Leone: Yes.Laura Murphy: Yes, I know and what was that like? What was she like? You know, no one knew Harley.Henrietta Green Leone: Well, that was such an early stage in my life, [00:15:00] and all I remember is that she was very good to me, very kind, I guess I was spoiled rotten.Laura Murphy: Now you're just listening to your brothers and sisters on that.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Did you feel spoiled?Henrietta Green Leone: No, I didn't, but I felt unwanted after she died.Laura Murphy: Did you?Henrietta Green Leone: YeahLaura Murphy: How old were you when she died, Auntie?Henrietta Green Leone: I was five.Laura Murphy: Oh that would have been bad.Henrietta Green Leone: She died 1935, and I was five or six.Laura Murphy: Because you had to go to a household that you weren't used to or?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, I don't remember being away from the family.Laura Murphy: Well, because you guys pretty much was always together, right?Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. I don't remember, but I remember I had very sad memories. Coming back being not wanted and think, ""Oh you're the adopted one"", that sort of thing.Laura Murphy: When they are teasing you?Henrietta Green Leone: There has always been a hurtful experience, and till this day.Laura Murphy: Maybe that's why you are always so sensitive too, and I felt the same way in my family. Not being quite accepted the way as much as I should be. I always appreciated that Auntie. Thank you very much. So you don't really remember her other than just the feeling that she gave you?Henrietta Green Leone: Just the feeling that she gave me and when she was very ill, I remember laying in bed by her side and talking and she would put her arm around me.Laura Murphy: Well Auntie, I think that's great that you had such a good experience with her and I want you to know that I felt the same thing with Nana when she died that I didn't know what to do for while there either because I think we probably had the same thing because they always made fun of me about how I would always go with Nana and they would never get to go with Nana.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: I can't help it, but I was more fun than they were. You too. What were your parents like? I know Nana was pretty strict.Henrietta Green Leone: Well, both of my parents were strict. I mean, we didn't have a lot of money and things, but we had a very happy home.Laura Murphy: What kind of things did you do as a family?Henrietta Green Leone: We played cards a lot, and we had a wood store and the thing I remember mostly was, we would be playing cards and my mother and dad would play cards with their friends, but we kids, they play cards with us. We had a wooden stove and my mother would turn the little lid over, of the wooden stove, just went over.Laura Murphy: I know, that little plate.Henrietta Green Leone: So if we lost, everybody got to put their finger on them on the back of the clay and paint your face all black.Laura Murphy: If you lost the game?Henrietta Green Leone: If you lost the game. So whoever had the most colorful face.Laura Murphy: Was the biggest loser. What kind of card games did you play? I know you guys are still big card players.Henrietta Green Leone: We played whist. Do you remember whist? We played different.Laura Murphy: Different whatever they had to do.Henrietta Green Leone: The neighbors we had, we were fortunate and had black neighbors.Laura Murphy: Hispanic?Henrietta Green Leone: No, we didn't have any Hispanic neighbors.Laura Murphy: No? White neighbors?Henrietta Green Leone: They were all white and mostly black and white and we'd play hide and go seek as a group. I mean one group against the other play hide and go seek under the street light, and we did that and they would go to whosever house, whosever turn that was our house pretty day healing South, Betty Davis's house or whosever house it was and the parents would fix. Every summer would have watermelon afterwards and play cards or cookies or ice cream or whatever, just [00:20:00] to treat.Laura Murphy: What kind of chores did you have to do? I know it was a lot.Henrietta Green Leone: Oh my God. Chores.Laura Murphy: Many hands make light work, Auntie. Remember?Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah, I know. My chore was that we always had to make our bed before going to school. Our room had to be clean. Pick up our clothes, all that thing. My Saturday morning chore was to change the paper in the cupboards every Saturday.Laura Murphy: Why would you change it every week?Henrietta Green Leone: I'm still wondering why. Every week I tell you. After I got married, I never changed the paper in my cupboard for a year. I never did. We did it every single Saturday.Laura Murphy: Was it paper or like newspaper?Henrietta Green Leone: It was white paper.Laura Murphy: You changed it every week?Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. Under the sink it was newspaper because things could get dirty earlier, so we use newspaper. But that and cleaning the bathroom.Laura Murphy: I'm with you on that when I hate that.Henrietta Green Leone: Was my chore every single Saturday.Laura Murphy: Did my mom get the little white glove tests from Nana or she'll go in?Henrietta Green Leone: I don't know.Laura Murphy: My mom used to go in, and she would do a wake up test, ""Oh, there's a piece of dust on the shelf. Do the whole bathroom over again."" Did you have to do that?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, I don't know, but I remember putting up notes there. [inaudible 00:21:37]Laura Murphy: [inaudible 00:21:42]Henrietta Green Leone: No, of course not.Laura Murphy: Of course not. Who is the relative that you had who is the biggest influence on you do you think?Henrietta Green Leone: RelativeLaura Murphy: The relative that was the biggest influence on your life?Henrietta Green Leone: My mother.Laura Murphy: Your mum, why?Henrietta Green Leone: Well, she would teach me by doing things and showing me how to do it, to be accepted of other people for whatever the reason. She was very kind and she was honest.Laura Murphy: Brutally honest?Henrietta Green Leone: Both.Laura Murphy: Both?Henrietta Green Leone: Both. Brutally honest when she needed to be, and very compassionate when she had to be.Laura Murphy: I know that when you decided to marry uncle Tony, she was not too happy about that.Henrietta Green Leone: No.Laura Murphy: But I know but I know she grew to love him later.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Yeah. He was good, but was that hard for you to go against her wishes on that or?Henrietta Green Leone: No, because, she was brutally honest. She said, ""He's old, too old for you.''Laura Murphy: 12 years?Henrietta Green Leone: ''There's too much yet you can do, you can go to school, you can be what you want to do and this thing.'' But once I told her that, ''I thought this was okay for me.'' She accepted it in her own way. She was accepting of it, she was always very kind to him.Laura Murphy: Oh, no, I know. So it's not true that he had to bring a bottle of Tequila over, to get her to say yes?Henrietta Green Leone: He did it. He brought her, but if he did it, he did it because he needed the courage himself.Laura Murphy: Uncle Tony had to bring a bottle of tequila and get [inaudible 00:24:15] a drunk before she would say yes.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. He needed the fault courage for himself.Laura Murphy: She probably enjoyed.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah, she was shocked.Laura Murphy: Oh, yeah, she wasn't expecting it?Henrietta Green Leone: No.Laura Murphy: Oh, really? Were you dating on the sly yet?Henrietta Green Leone: Oh no, but when I came I got engaged on April Fool's Day, and he always said he took me serious and I said, ""Yeah, but you were the biggest fool at last."" But I came in and I showed her my ring, she didn't say a word. I will never, ever forget that look on her face.Laura Murphy: What did it look like? I could see [00:25:00] it that she's expressing.Henrietta Green Leone: She looked at me, looked at the ring, and turned her face. Never said a word. It was card but then the next day she was -Laura Murphy: She was fine.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: She's slept on it, she was okay. Well, you're her baby, weren't you? Was Uncle Chinni already married by then?Henrietta Green Leone: No.Laura Murphy: No.Henrietta Green Leone: It was just your mother and I and then uncle [inaudible 00:25:27] I forget who was married first.Laura Murphy: But my mom was married first. What do you remember about her wedding? I know you guys had two different, just within a year of each other, weren't they?Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. We married in 48 and she married.Laura Murphy: 47Henrietta Green Leone: 47, yeah.Laura Murphy: No, yeah, 40 here.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. I remember it was on a Saturday evening and she had the first mass on Saturday evening that had ever been.Laura Murphy: The first evening mass?Henrietta Green Leone: I think so. I think she was.Laura Murphy: A ground breaker. I know you chose the hottest day.Henrietta Green Leone: Earliest mass in the morning, the first thing in the morning.Laura Murphy: That's unusual to get married first thing in the morning. Is that the way they did it back then?Henrietta Green Leone: Got married in July. So you had to get married early.Laura Murphy: Did you choose July? Why did you choose to be in the hottest month?Henrietta Green Leone: I don't know.Laura Murphy: You just wanted to get married?Henrietta Green Leone: When we were in April, I was engaged in April, April Fool's Day, and then married in May, June, July.Laura Murphy: Yeah, three months later. That was more like than I thought auntie, that's what I did too. What were your siblings like growing up? Maybe you had three very interesting ones. Tell me a favorite story from uncle [inaudible 00:27:07]. What do you remember about him, the oldest?Henrietta Green Leone: He would neat.Laura Murphy: What did he do?Henrietta Green Leone: He was always fair to me. He was always very good. The thing I remember most is that I had braids, I grew up in braids.Laura Murphy: Yes I know.Henrietta Green Leone: Your mother cut her hair without permission and I went through high school. I cut my hair before I got 50.Laura Murphy: So you didn't break his heart by cutting your hair before he died?Henrietta Green Leone: No. But within two weeks, I'll go more [inaudible 00:27:59] $15. In those days that was a lot of money. He said, baby, go cut your hair and get a perm. I will never forget that.Laura Murphy: That was a gift from heaven.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. So he was very good to me, very good. Uncle Chinni when we were kids, we were close, but I moved away and he had his colonel and his friends. So we didn't have a lot of fun. In high school, we did and aunty I never did anything right to this day.Laura Murphy: Love-hate relationship?Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah. Never did anything right or anything the way it shouldn't be done.Laura Murphy: You thinks she took the older sister role all too serious?Henrietta Green Leone: Very much. To this day. I mean, that you'd just, you know what is this.Laura Murphy: Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. What's your first memory of me?There is a question.Henrietta Green Leone: You. First memory of you is this. You were born in November. I came down for when you were born, you were the cutest little thing.Laura Murphy: Thank you auntie.Henrietta Green Leone: For some reason we've always had a very close relationship, so I have been proud of you.Laura Murphy: Thank you, auntie. I'll forgive you for keeping that eighth grade picture of me. I know that you always let me go out to visit you in Washington. I always loved that and stuff. Well, tell me about your time up in Washington. I know you didn't like it at all.Henrietta Green Leone: The first year I cried.Laura Murphy: [00:30:00] Was it just too different from Arizona?Henrietta Green Leone: It was cold. But I had lived in the snow before. [inaudible 00:30:08] Missouri was very cold and I was able to [inaudible 00:30:14] had Cynthia. But when we moved to Missouri to Spokane, I thought, if we move the first year I did nothing but cry.Laura Murphy: I know. My mum used to say that.Henrietta Green Leone: When I went I stayed there. I had three robes. One I wore, one at the wash and clean and I wore robe every day, all day. When Cynthia went to school in the morning, her friend would come by and pick her up. We lived just about three blocks from school and took her a long time to tell me this. But she said, I thought you were an alcoholic. I wouldn't leave the house and I was always in a robe.Laura Murphy: Well, I'm glad you got over that because you did-Henrietta Green Leone: After the first winter, I thought, ""This is ridiculous, I've got to get with it."" Then I got involved in church and different things with the neighbors and made friends and so-.Laura Murphy: So it turned out to be-Henrietta Green Leone: It turned out to be a very pleasant-.Laura Murphy: But I know you were happy when we moved back to Phoenix.Henrietta Green Leone: Oh, yeah.Laura Murphy: Okay. What's the most important lessons that you've learned in life?Henrietta Green Leone: That I have learned is that you can't tell anybody what to do, how to do it, or anything. You just have to let things be as they are. You have to be accepting of everything and anything even if you agree or disagree, and you just have to do when you see someone that is hurting or needs help, you have to help.Laura Murphy: Well, you've done that, Auntie. More than your share, I think in anything. Has your life been different than you imagine?Henrietta Green Leone: Yes. Than what I imagined? It has. I've been-Laura Murphy: What did you think would happen? What would you think you would do?Henrietta Green Leone: When I was young, what did I think? I have to be stuck here in Yuma, doing nothing, you know, just-Laura Murphy: Being.Henrietta Green Leone: -not being. Just being. But I was lucky and was able to meet a lot of different people-Laura Murphy: And through a lot of experiences?Henrietta Green Leone: -and just the experience of meeting different nationalities, and having friends of different nationalities.Laura Murphy: Then I'm glad your life turned out right. I'm glad I've been able to be a part of it too because-Henrietta Green Leone: I am glad you are.Laura Murphy: Thank you, Auntie. Thanks for agreeing to the interview. I know you weren't exactly-Henrietta Green Leone: I didn't know what. Well, well. We'll always do and it will be okay.Laura Murphy: Thank you.Speaker 3: Can we have just a few minutes, I was just wondering what's your favorite time that you shared memories with.Laura Murphy: My favorite time with my Aunt?Speaker 3: Yeah.Laura Murphy: You know in my young memory, Auntie. You're going to love this. My favorite memory of my Aunt is the time I went out to visit her. First of all, the first was ""Can we not do visit her?"" Because my mom, I had to take a high school course. Remember the typing, Auntie? And my mom says, ""You cannot leave. You're not going with your Auntie anywhere until you finish that typing course."" I remember we waited till my mom was down and then you helped me do all the typing. I took it in to the teacher and she goes, ""You didn't have any help with this, Laura?"" ""Oh, no. I did it all myself."" Finally, I got to go. Then when we went up there, you remember you taught me how to paint. Remember, we painted your bedroom? That the best part is that we go, ""Oh, we need some music, Auntie, and we're going to paint"" and you let me choose the radio station. Remember, we were playing the rock and roll radio station? My mother would have never, ever, let me do that. You just said, "" [inaudible 00:34:55] ""Who is this guy, Laura?"" ""That's Cream, Auntie. They're great."" ""They're not [00:35:00] too bad."" That was so much fun, just spending the time up there where you just let me be.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Just like you said. You just let me be me and you didn't try to change me. You just let me in. It was just so much fun, even though we worked to work the basement, painted everything, but it was a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun when we went up there. I loved that.Speaker 3: How did the paint turn out in the bedroom?Henrietta Green Leone: Awesome.Laura Murphy: Awesome. It was awesome.Speaker 3: Do you remember what color you preferred?Laura Murphy: I don't remember. Do you, Auntie? I just remember,Henrietta Green Leone: It think it was yellow or it was the basement?Laura Murphy: No. Yeah, we painted both. Your porch, your bedroom, and the basement.Henrietta Green Leone: The bedroom was a beige color.Laura Murphy: Yeah.Henrietta Green Leone: The basement was-Laura Murphy: Yeah. I remember when I was going ""What's this room?"" ""What's a basement. What's a basement?"" Because we had never had basements in Yuma. So it's like going ""Wow. This is a weird old room.""Henrietta Green Leone: It's like when we lived in Missouri and it was when i had never even thought of or ever heated a home by coal. She had to ship and to stoke the furnace [inaudible 00:36:25] Tony always had, on weekends, sometimes once a month anyway, to be commanding officer at the base and I never learned how to stoke a furnace and I had never borrowed anything from any of my neighbors, sugar, flour, anything like that. I went to the neighbor next door and I said,""May I borrow a shovel full of coal and have your husband come help me how to stoke this furnace? I don't know how because I just think there's something new to me.""Laura Murphy: Oh, no, we don't have work or as much with furnaces here and we don't much need them.Henrietta Green Leone: Then when we moved to Spokane, we had oil, so they'd just call-.Laura Murphy: Oh, I remember that-Henrietta Green Leone: What was that little Getty? Remember the girl who used to sing all the time. If you need oil, just call boil or something like that now.Laura Murphy: But I remember going up there. I remember our three-day trip to going up there with-Henrietta Green Leone: To Canada.Laura Murphy: -to well, to Canada. Remember my dad had us all stumped because he was doing Chicken Little?Henrietta Green Leone: Oh,yeah.Laura Murphy: He had us going for I think all the way to Canada that he just kept going no, no, no. ""Daddy, you had more than 20 questions."" Those were fun. Those were fun. Yeah. I used to love that route that I always wanted a station wagon like that.Henrietta Green Leone: Yeah.Laura Murphy: Because I thought maybe my family would be as nice and close as that if I have a station wagon like that stuff but thank you very much, Auntie, because-Henrietta Green Leone: I'm glad.Laura Murphy: I'm so glad.Henrietta Green Leone: Very good.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
MBY006144,"Jorge Valdez: [00:00:00] Well, my name is Jorge Valdez. I'm 26 years old. Today's date is January 23rd, 2010, in Yuma, Arizona. I am Jesusita's husband.Jesusita Valdez: My name is Jesusita Valdez. I'm 28 years old. Today is January 23rd, 2010. We are in Yuma, Arizona, and I am Jorge's wife.Jorge Valdez: Okay. Jesusita, what do you do for a living? Tell me how you got into your line of work.Jesusita Valdez: I am a teacher. I teach Math at a high school. I've bean teaching for six years. I've always wanted to be a teacher. I remember I wanted to be a teacher in Kindergarten. I never thought of being anything else.Jorge Valdez: That was there any teacher or teachers that has strong influence to, I guess, leading you into being a teacher?Jesusita Valdez: I had a lot of good teachers, and good coaches. I had a seventh and eighth grade coach, basketball coach, and he was also my History teacher. He really inspired me to do good in school, to be good in sports. He would push us so hard, and that to me, I just felt I was a better person because he would push it so hard. I was doing more than I would have done on my own. I always wanted to be a teacher, but when I met, his name was Mr. Mackenzie. He really pushed his hard. That's one teacher that stands out a lot.Jorge Valdez: Any story is that stick out about Mr. Mackenzie that you remember specifically that was to go out your mind?Jesusita Valdez: He was my coach in the seventh grade. I started playing basketball, and I had never touched a basketball before. Neither had any of my teammates. So we are very, very bad. Where most of us were seventh graders we were horrible. We didn't know how to put a bawl in bounds. We didn't know how to dribble, but he would work with us so hard. We had an eighth grader in our team, she was so good. I always looked up to her because she was so good. But a coach to work with us all the same. He'd worked with her, and with us, and teach us things. At the end of my eighth grade year, I remember we got him a plaque, and I had organized getting this plaque for him because we were so proud that he was our coach, and we'd learned so much. We'd gotten competitive and improved as a team. We really, really appreciated him. We had a big assembly, and we're going to present this award to him. I was getting everything ready because I was heading the award project. I'd got all the money for my teammates, and asked the principle for her permission to do this. So I was getting everything ready. He was announcing all the awards to a team, and telling the school how our team had done, and how much we'd grown in two years. As I was getting his plaque ready, he announced the most valuable player, and he said my name. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that I was his most valuable player on his team. So I thought there was other players that were really good, but he selected me from everybody, and I was just so excited, I couldn't believe it. They tolled me, ""he said your name,"" and I remember thinking, ""oh, he must read the wrong one from the list."" He looked at me, and he signaled me to come over to him, and he gave me a certificate, and he gave me a plaque. I'd never thought that would happen. So he wrote a little message about how hard I've worked on the back of my certificate. He told me to keep doing that because that would take me places. I remember that because I worked really hard not to be the most valuable player. I had just worked hard because he inspired me to work hard. I remember that every time it got hard in college, and high school, and in life, I just think back to those words, and how it wasn't about a price, but it was just about giving him my best. I think he really inspired me to do that.Jorge Valdez: Do you remember what the message was that was at the back of your certificate?Jesusita Valdez: I just remember he wrote, ""thank you for working hard. Keep doing this. It will take you great places.""Jorge Valdez: So what does your work life taught you? What lessons have you been able to carry on outside of your job?Jesusita Valdez: For my work, I've always worked really hard. I loved my job. I've told my students before that if I could do it for free, if I didn't need to make money to [00:05:00] pay every day things that I would still do it in a heartbeat because it's such an amazing job. But one of the hardest things that I've learned from my job is that, when I was in college, I would work hard, really hard, and I was always successful. That's all it took, me working hard. Sometimes if I didn't succeed, if I failed in a particular topic or if things didn't go the way they were supposed to, I just went back to the drawing board, and work harder. I just studied more, I just did more, and it always worked out. I always did very well. When I started working as a teacher, I thought that that's what it would take. Just me working really hard, and giving him a best shot, and that my students would be successful if I did that. I've learned that that's not always the case. I can't control everything. It's been very hard because I've had to deal with the human element. Whether they want to succeed, whether they're having a good day, whether their attitude and their mind is in the write place or not. Sometimes even when I work really hard, and I give it my best shot, sometimes that's not enough. That's been very, very hard to deal with is that I have to learn that I'm not in control of everything. There's other factors besides just me. For college, it was always just all about me, and how hard I worked. But I think that's a very important lesson. We're not in control of everything, and we don't decide how everything works out.Jorge Valdez: What make sure you strive to be a better teacher? What brings you to teaching? Is it your coworkers and fellow teachers, administration? Is it the students that really get you going or is it just the challenge of having the human element?Jesusita Valdez: When I first started teaching, I think I was very focused on myself, and I wanted my students to succeed because I wanted to be a good teacher. I wanted to make a difference in their lives, but I think I just wanted to be known that way, I was a good teacher. I've been working with the students at San Luis High School for six years and that's changed so much. I work with students who have a lot less than I have now, a lot less. They don't have support at home. They may not have role models at home. Their parents don't understand goals of higher education. Maybe their parents may not even be around. Any of these students show up in my classroom, and give the best of themselves. I asked a lot of them, and they'll do it. I will ask them to come after school, I'll ask them two go to school on Saturdays to do tutoring sessions, specifically my Calculus students. These students will do it in a heartbeat. They're just waiting for me to challenge them. I know that their parents don't make a lot of money. Their parents have minimal education, maybe just grade school. But yet these kids are full of potential. They're so full of the ability to be so incredibly successful. I always think that I had people who inspired me. So if I could just help them in a little way, I feel that that's worth it. I known that they are going to be so successful, and they're going to change, they're really going to change the way their family lives. Sometimes when they comment about how their parents they can't afford things or they won't take them to college trips, I just think it's not going to be like that anymore. You're going to go to college, and you're going to be financially stable. You're going to understand the importance of an education, and it's not going to be like that for your kids. It just really gets me going because I think they're going to break the cycle. They're going to break the cycle like I feel I did in my family. That's what gets me going every day. If these kids were willing to give a 100 percent, who am I not to give my best shot so that they can get there?Jorge Valdez: You talk about your kids' hardships that they have to endure. What are some of the similarities and differences between your childhood to the kids that you teach, their childhood?Jesusita Valdez: I think that's what inspires me so much about them, is that we're very similar. We grew up in very similar ways. My parents didn't have a lot of money growing up. For the first [00:10:00] eight, nine years of my life, my parents were not in this country legally, and so we always lived in fear that my parents would be taken away. What would we do? Because we were born in the United States, but they couldn't be here. So we were really scared. I remember how my parents would be afraid of going out in the street or doing anything because they didn't want to have attention on them. We couldn't even travel. A lot of my students live like that right now. Their parents aren't here legally or they're not here at all and they are forced to stay with aunts, or cousins or neighbors, even sometimes. Even when they were able to fix their legal situation, my dad always worked in the fields and my mom did too. So we didn't have a lot of money, but they worked really, really hard so we could have what we needed. I think one of the hardest parts was, I wanted to go to college and I wanted things to be different, but I didn't know how and they didn't know how and they didn't understand how to get me there. Our school didn't have the resources that my students have now. Our school has a great counseling department. Our students are advised very well. They're taken care of in terms of scholarships. I didn't have all that growing up. So I had to find out how to fill out a financial aid application. I had to take an ACT. I didn't know what that was. My parents didn't know what that was. I didn't know about applications to college or essays. I didn't know any of that, but I knew I wanted to go to college. So I relate to these students a lot because their parents don't have a lot of background just like mine didn't either, and yet they have potential and they want to make things different and they know they can do it and they're just working hard. I feel that we're very very similar in that area.Jorge Valdez: Tell me more about your relationship with your parents. You said that you had to deal with hardships and you're the first in your family to accomplish some things, can elaborate on where maybe you had some issues or some great things that stood out between the relationship with you and your parents?Jesusita Valdez: Well, my father always worked in the fields and he knew that he didn't want me to work there. I'm the oldest of three. My two brothers, in the summers, would go work in the fields and they'd come home exhausted and it was hard work and my dad would allow them to go, but he never let me go. He said I was a girl, so he didn't want me to work a job like that. He wanted me to maybe work at a school or a bank or a store, something like that. My mother worked in the fields, but she always believed that I would go to school and then I wouldn't work in the fields like they had. Well, when I was getting ready to go, my dad, because I was the only girl, he didn't want me to go. Going to a university meant that I had to leave my little town where I grew up and I'd have to go alone. Being the first one and being his only girl, he didn't want that. My dad is very, very traditional. He didn't want me to leave and he told me that I wouldn't go. He told me that he just wanted me to get a job at the bank or a grocery store or somewhere where I wouldn't have to work in the fields, but he didn't want me to go, and I really wanted to go. I told him that I was going to go and he said, ""No, you're not."" I remember I cried and I talked to my mom and I really wanted him to understand what I was trying to do, but he wouldn't have it. He would say, ""No, you're not going. You're not going."" One day, it was a February of my senior year and I was trying to get everything ready to go to college, but I didn't know if I could go because maybe he wouldn't let me. The school would have a student of the month, and that month I was the student of the month of my entire school and because I was the student of the month, they called him and my mom home and they told them that they had to come take a picture with me at school because we were going to be in the newspaper and my dad came. He had to take the day off work. My mom came, my dad came and we took a picture. I remember that he had to ask for the day off and his coworkers and his boss said, ""Why do you need the day off?"" He said, ""Well, my daughter is student of the month at the high school and I have to go take a picture."" Of course, everybody [00:15:00] congratulated him. I think that day he realized that it was a good thing. That I always doing the right thing because after that he told me it was okay, he told me I could go and he was still very worried, but he said I could go. That was a really hard time between me and my parents because I wanted to go very badly and they didn't understand what I was trying to do. My mom was more supportive but my father didn't want me to go. After that incident, I felt he just understood that I wasn't trying to leave the house to go do my own will and do things that he wouldn't approve of, but that my whole life I had really worked hard for that and that's what I would continue to do.Jorge Valdez: Okay. So it seems like your family was stripped with some I guess, maybe prejudice. With what you've done so far with your life and the successes that you've had, how has that changed things for the better between you and your parents?Jesusita Valdez: Both my mom and my dad are very, very proud of me. I know that. I know that because he brags about me all the time with his friends and he'll talk to me and he'll ask me, ""How're those students going?"" and ""How is the school?"" He'll ask me things like that, and he wants to know what I do. I'm very happy because it wasn't always that way. I think it's changed a lot of things in my family after I went to college. Both of my brothers attended as well and I was able to help them. I was able to say, ""Look, you need to fill out this form"", or ""This is how you do the dorms and this is how you sign up for classes."" I was able to help them a lot. Nobody really in my family had gone to a four-year university before I did. Now, it seems as if it was just not that impossible for my family. It opened a lot of doors. I know this is just a small story, but it meant a lot to us. When we were growing up, my parents never had enough money to buy a nice car and they never had credit to buy one that was even close to being new. If we ever wanted to buy anything that required credit or financing, we always had to ask a relative to sign for us and they wouldn't want to do it sometimes and it was really hard. When I graduated from college, I remember that I was able to sign for my parents to buy a car and that might seem like a very minute thing for anybody, but for us it was big because from now on, we would never have to ask anybody else to sign anything for us. Now, if my parents needed something, I could sign for it because I had credit and I could do that. It seems a really silly thing, but it was almost like a feeling of freedom. We didn't have to go beg or ask somebody else to do it for us, we could do it for ourselves, and I think my parents really appreciate that, and I really appreciate that we can now do something like that. But it's really opened the doors for a lot of my other family members to go to college and my family feels real proud that they were able to go to a university graduation and that they were able to experience things that they never got to experience for themselves.Jorge Valdez: Okay. Finish this sentence. I was the first person in my family who?Jesusita Valdez: Well, I had a lot of firsts. I was the first one to learn English. I was the first one to graduate from college. I was the first one to graduate at the top of my high school class, at the top of my college class. I was the first one to marry a military person. I think I've been the first in a lot of things in my family and it's been a privilege to do that. But just going back to the learning English, my family didn't know to communicate in English when I was growing up, but I wanted to go to school. I always loved school, and I wanted to go to school. When I would come home, I would tell my mom all these words that I would learn and I would say Mom, ""I learned this. I learned this."" The reason I like school so much is because when I was young, I thought that I had two ideas in my head. I thought that if I could learn English, and if I could be taller than the kitchen table, then I could fix my dad's immigration situation. I thought that. So every day when I'd come home from school, I would check [00:20:00] my height at the table and then I would tell my mom all the words I learned. I don't know why, but I just thought if I was taller than the table and if I knew English, that I can make my dad be legal in this country. So every day I would do that. I would tell her what I learned and I measured myself with the table. One day I came home and I told my mom I learned a new word. She said, ""Well, what's that?"" I told her, but it was a bad word. She said, ""Where did you learn that?"" I said, ""From my friends. I learned that from my friends."" ""Well, what does it mean?"" ""I don't know mom, but they always say it, so I learned it.""MALE_1: What was the word?Jesusita Valdez: It was the F-word. I had learned the F -word, and my mom knew what that meant. So she told me that was not okay, that was not going to get my dad anywhere so I couldn't say it anymore. But just how things were for learning English for me, I didn't know what things meant, but I was excited to learn.Jorge Valdez: Okay. What's the proudest moment in your life for everything that you've been through? What is the proudest moment of your life?Jesusita Valdez: There's a lot of moments that I can say I'm really, really proud of, but mostly I'm just proud that to this day I've led a life that my parents can be proud of, and I don't have to ever be ashamed of anything I've done and my parents can be proud of that. I always measure it that way. I haven't always done everything they've wanted, for example, I went to college and my dad didn't necessarily agree, but he's proud of it now. The way I've conducted my life, my parents are proud of it and I'm proud of it. That's very important to me more than just a specific moment in time because there's been a lot of things that I'm very extremely proud of. But just overall, I feel like I've led a very good life and I try to help others in as much as I can, and I'm proud of that.Jorge Valdez: Okay.FEMALE_1: Can I ask the question? When did you first hear about college? How did you learn about the ACT as in the financial aid forms?Jesusita Valdez: I was in high school, and I didn't want to do what my parents did. We lead a good life, we never went hungry, and we never were cold, but I didn't want to have to work the way they did to be okay. I wanted to lead a better life, and I understood that education was my way out because, even if I was the MVP in eighth grade was not going to play basketball for a living. My way out was education and I understood that, but I didn't know how to go about it. I remember being a sophomore in high school and I had all these honor classes, and none of my friends were in them. They were just all these people that usually were from another middle school that I had never really met, and they'd always be leaving the classroom and I'd say, ""Why are these people always leaving the classroom?"" They'd go to the counseling office and then they'd come back. I never got to leave the classroom. They always would come back with these big manila folders or yellow envelopes, and I didn't understand. So finally, one day I asked one of my classmates his name was Cathy and I said, ""Cathy, where do you go?"" He's like, ""I got my ACT stuff."" ACT stuff, what's that? ""You don't know about ACT?"" I said, ""No, I don't."" He's like, ""Well, it's that test you have to take to go to college."" ""I've to take a test to go to college?"" He says, ""Yeah, you got to take it. You don't know about it?"" I said, ""No."" So I went to the counseling office and I asked if they knew anything about ACT tests and they said, ""Oh, yeah. Here's a packet of information."" I remember filling it out and not really knowing what I was doing, but I sent it out and having an appointment. Then after that, I realized that I could do it more than once. So I went and I did it. I think I went into the counseling office about twice and asked about college stuff, and just filled it out. I do remember filling out my financial aid on my own and asking my parents for their income taxes, and they had no clue how to fill out this form. I remember between my friends and I, we figured out how to fill it out and we sent it in. Then I'm not sure if it was the proper way to fill it out, but they sent back a paper and asked us to make some corrections, and we did that, and then we got it back and I was able to go. Students that I work with now it's very, very different. They have college nights where they'll have the college financial aid at the Arizona Western College, who come out and help them fill it out. There's counselors who will help them fill it out, counselors who will monitor all their scholarships, talk to them about how much money they're going to need, how much money they have. I didn't have any [00:25:00] of that. In fact, in my senior year I was hoping that I could go, and I didn't know how I was going to pay for this. I knew we could get loans, but I'd have to get them because my parents wouldn't qualify for any and I really didn't know how to apply for scholarships, and I didn't know how to do anything. I had applied to Northern Arizona University, and I had gotten accepted and they had offered me a scholarship, but it was only about $700. So I had said, ""Yes."" One day, my English teacher, Mrs. Sandusky, says to me, ""Did you apply for the Rotary scholarship?"" I said, ""No."" ""Why not? You fit all the qualifications. They're looking for students who want to go to college and who have financial need."" I said, ""Well, I don't know about it Mrs. Sandusky."" She says, ""Well, you got to go to the counseling office and get this form. All you need is a letter of recommendation and an essay, but it's due today at 3:30. I said, ""Oh Mrs. Sandusky, I'm sorry, but I don't have a letter of recommendation"" and she said, ""Well, I'll write you one, just write your essay."" So I wrote my essay and she wrote me a letter of recommendation by 3:30 that day, and I turned in the scholarship. A few weeks later, they announced that I had won the scholarship and it was a full tuition paid scholarship for four years to an Arizona State University. I don't even know that I understood what that meant at the time, but it meant that this Local Rotary Club would be paying for my tuition for four years at a state university, which is great. So I was able to get some grants from the government, I was able to get this scholarship, thanks to this teacher I got and a scholarship from NAU, and because of that I went to college and I had a lot of money leftover for food, and books, and clothes, and I would have to adapt to the Flagstaff weather. So that's how I got to college and I feel very fortunate because it's almost like God was taking care of me the whole time because I certainly didn't know what I was doing and everything got taken care of. So when I went and understood what had just happened and how I should have done things differently, I really tried to help my brothers and I tried to help anybody that I could so that they didn't have to just be lucky like I was.Jorge Valdez: With your background and the family history that you have, how do you lead your life today and help your extended family and your students to better themselves or seek better opportunities?Jesusita Valdez: Well, with my students, I have some students who are scared to leave for a university and they want to settle maybe for studying part-time at AWC, Arizona Western College. I talk to them, and I tell them, ""You don't understand, this is an amazing opportunity and you're totally prepared to go."" I really talk to them, and sometimes their heart is in it, they want to go but sometimes their parents, just like mine, they don't want them to go. I had a student just a couple of years ago who was accepted into MIT with a full-ride scholarship, everything paid. She didn't even know that she had gotten a full-ride scholarship. She just came into my classroom one day and she was crying, and this is a girl that she's very strong, I'd never seen her close to being teary-eyed before, and here she's crying and she told me that she really wanted to go to MIT, but her mother wasn't going to allow her to. I said, ""Why?"" She says, ""My mom says we don't have enough money, and she's going to have to get another job and she just can't handle that."" She says, ""But I got this letter."" She shows it to me and that letter said that she had a full-ride scholarship somewhere around $50,000 a year, and MIT was providing that for her. I said, ""Are you kidding me?"" Your mom doesn't have to give you a penny. You have money here for travel. They budgeted money for your travel and everything. She says, ""She won't let me go."" I knew her mom didn't understand what this meant, so I talked to the counselors, and the counselors talked to the mother and the mother said she just didn't feel comfortable because she was sending her daughter far away and she didn't know what it was like. So together with my co-workers, I'm the head of the National Honor Society, and this girl was in the National Honor Society, we put together money and teachers would put money together. We put all this money together and we were able to pay for her mother and her to go visit [00:30:00] MIT so that her mother would let her go, and she did. I was very happy. So I don't want students to miss out on an opportunity just because either they don't understand or their parents don't understand what kind of opportunity is before them. In my family, I just try very, very hard as much as I can do for them to help them out, some of them going to college, some of them just stay at home, whenever they need anything they know that I try to make it happen for them.Jorge Valdez: Okay. With getting students to go to MIT, and I'm sure other prestigious colleges, what else do you do to accomplish? What does the future hold for you, where you want to go from here? Are the St. Louis Students, the only students you feel connected to or do you feel branching out to many other areas as well?Jesusita Valdez: When I came to St. Louis High School, my plan was to be there for two years. I remember that I didn't even want to buy a t-shirt because I didn't want to get attached to the school. So I was two years, and then I was going to do a masters. It's been six years, and I have pretty much every t-shirt that they sell at the school. The students really have a spot in my heart, and it's because we are so alike. But I understand that in order to give back as much as I want to my community, to my students, and to my family, I have to also prepare myself. It's going to be hard to leave this place, but I hope to start a master's soon and prepare myself even better. I have to continue growing myself because I've given them a lot, but it's been six years and I have to do something for myself as well.Jorge Valdez: So what's your plan then to grow?Jesusita Valdez: I don't know if I have a set plan right now, but I just got married. So that plays a big part too.Jorge Valdez: Does your husband have any plans to help you grow?Jesusita Valdez: My husband would love for us to move to Texas, and I know he wants to go there because his family is there, and I love that about him. He loves his family very much and he misses them. But I struggle with the concept of moving to Texas, even if I understand there's a lot of opportunities there for me in terms of universities. I struggle with it because moving there means moving away from my family, and I know it hurts him to be away from his family. But I've never lived more than four hours away from mine, and so it's a very tough decision.Jorge Valdez: Okay. Do you always see yourself teaching high school or do you want to teach other great levels maybe even teach at the college level?Jesusita Valdez: I think someday I will teach at a university.Jorge Valdez: Do you have any university in mind that you'd like to teach at?Jesusita Valdez: I know my husband would like me to go to University of Texas, but no I don't have a specific one.FEMALE_2: Do you remember your first day in the classroom as a teacher?Jesusita Valdez: Yes. I was so scared. I knew the students knew I was shaking. I just remember introductions and I remember at the end of the day I was so happy it was over. It was a hard time, it was hard. After the first week, I wondered if I could survive another one. I didn't think I'd be there much longer because it so incredibly hard. But everyone would tell me it'll get easier but it just felt like it was getting harder and harder. Six years later it has gotten a lot easier and now you're able to really enjoy it versus trying to figure out how do you settle these students down. Here you are straight out of college trying to make the biggest impact and the biggest difference in their life, and you just can't even get them to sit down and be quiet. That was so hard but once you get past that it just comes with time, then it's when you really start to make a difference.Jorge Valdez: Do you feel yourself ever looking at newer teachers or teachers that are fresh out of college and saying that was me?Jesusita Valdez: Yes.Jorge Valdez: Then coaching them through it or helping them out?Jesusita Valdez: Yes. It's happening right now as a matter of fact and I realized that that was me, that those are the things I did and there's really no other way to make it. I could tell them this is how you do this to this, but really it just comes with time. You just learn. It doesn't come for everybody, you really have to want to learn to be a good teacher. If you're just there to get a paycheck things aren't going to change for you, but if you really want it, then it comes with time.FEMALE_2: What do you think makes a good teacher?Jesusita Valdez: [00:35:00] I think the ability to relate to these students. It doesn't even have to do about how much you know or how well you can deliver content. Is just about, do these students believe that you truly believe they can make it? Do you have faith? Do these students have confidence that you really have a vested interest in them, that you're not just there for a paycheck? If they feel like you truly believe in them, then they'll jump as high as you want them to but if they feel like you're just there for a paycheck, they're just there to waste time. They truly have to feel like you believe in them.FEMALE_2: What would you like to say to your students?Jesusita Valdez: I always tell them that they should always follow their passion, their heart and if they ever wake up in the morning and they don't truly love what they do, then they need to find a different thing, a different way, a different means to living. They're not in the right career, in the right job. They have to love what they're doing regardless of how much they get paid and I tell them to never forget to look back and pull someone up.Jorge Valdez: Very good. Seems like you have done a lot and you plan on doing other great things as well.Jesusita Valdez: Yes.FEMALE_2: How does it feel when a student succeeds? What does that make you feel like just seeing your students succeed?Jesusita Valdez: The place where I work right now and I've been asked this question many times, why don't you just go to a place where it's easier? Where kids do have the role models at home and there is a structure for them going to college and it is expected, and they're truly honor students and it's a lot easier because you could get a job there. Why don't you do that? I just find that there is no merit in doing something that's already expected. Then, well, these kids would have gone to college without me anyway. But here I am working in a community where it does make a difference, and I know that there are things that I do that if I didn't do them, they wouldn't happen. That's amazing to know that maybe you're not the entire reason these students are going to college, but you were definitely a stepping stone for them to get there. That's awesome because it's not just them. They're going to turn around and they're going to make a difference for their family and that's major. They may never remember my name or they might forget about me in a few years, but because I was there and help them get a step further, maybe they're going to turn it around for their entire family, and I again have seen it in my family and it's just awesome.FEMALE_2: I just have one more question, sorry.Jesusita Valdez: That's okay.FEMALE_2: You said you knew from when you were in kindergarten that you wanted to be a teacher. How did you know that so young, what was it that made you know that you wanted to be a teacher?Jesusita Valdez: I think my personality has always been to organize and do things and take lead of the situation because I remember being in a kindergarten, our teacher would give us these lollipops if we did our homework, and I would think, ""Oh, that's so cool, I want to do that one day"". She would have student of the month and we'd get all these little things and I just think, ""Oh, that's so cool, that's what I want to do."" The teacher was just so cool and I wanted to be cool like her because she gave out all this stuff, and to being in high school where I would look at my math and science teachers and I'd respect them because I thought they were so knowledgeable. Then I wanted to be respected that way to going into college and then that changed from not just wanting to be respected, but wanting to make a difference for these students and truly help them break a cycle of say, poverty, or just lack of higher education in their family. Of course, now I'm realizing that I do have a little bit of impact in how they get there. So I think it's just changed so much over the years but from kindergarten, I remember wanting to be a teacher.FEMALE_2: Is there anything else you guys would like to say before we stop the recording?Jorge Valdez: Yeah. How would you like to be remembered either from San Luis or as a teacher? How would you like people to look back and think of you?Jesusita Valdez: I think I just want my family, my students, my coworkers, my administration to remember me as a person who-- I don't know if I'll reach all the goals that I have for my students and for myself, but I just know that I want them to remember I gave it my best shot every day. Whatever it was, I gave it my best shot and I truly enjoyed [00:40:00] what I do with my life. I truly enjoy what I'm involved in, and I always gave it my best shot, and I never gave it anything less than my best. Then I would like to thank my husband for doing this interview and for being so incredibly understanding of all the time, and everything that I dedicate to my work. I just like to thank him, I love him very much.Jorge Valdez: Thank you.Jesusita Valdez: Thank you.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
MBY006188,"John Rivera Sedlar:	[00:00:00] Hi, my name is John Rivera Sedlar. I'm 55 years old. Today's date is February 13th, 2010. We're in East Los Angeles and I'm friends with Lourdes Campos.Lourdes Campos:	Hello. My name is Lourdes Campos. I'm 50 and we're here in East Los Angeles. Today's February 13th, 2010 and my relationship to John is, we're good friends. So John, how did we meet?John Rivera Sedlar:	That's a short question. Lourdes and I met through the world of food and I have a very good friend named Joan Vogel, who introduced me to Lourdes one day because I was looking for someone to help with our small business, we made tamales. We were in the tamale business and I was meeting Joan for a cup of coffee and she said, ""Come with me right now, you've got to meet my friend."" So we went over to an office, I think it's called a Fulfillment.Lourdes Campos:	Yes, that's right. It's Fulfillment house.John Rivera Sedlar:	I met Lourdes and we talked a little bit about the food industry. I don't think we ever really worked together on the actual food. A later project came up. It also had to do with food. But it was very interesting the projects that Lourdes had and the products she was getting in.Lourdes Campos:	We were working with lots of gourmet food companies and shipping for them and getting them manufactured at that time. We were trying to help you do the same thing.John Rivera Sedlar:	Was it small companies?Lourdes Campos:	Small, little retail gourmet companies.John Rivera Sedlar:	Mail-order?Lourdes Campos:	Mail-order, shipping. We were doing a lot of big stores, Whole Foods, essence and you were involved in that too.John Rivera Sedlar:	Do you remember what year that was?Lourdes Campos:	I think it was 2000. It was about 2000 actually.John Rivera Sedlar:	That was 10 years ago.Lourdes Campos:	Right.John Rivera Sedlar:	I didn't realize that many years had gone by. I find it very interesting that food was popular at that time, but it wasn't white-hot popular like it is today.Lourdes Campos:	No, it's just starting. It was percolating.John Rivera Sedlar:	It was percolating and Americans, were starting to understand the importance of food. They didn't quite know how it connected to their heritage and to them as people, they didn't understand how nourishing or not nourishing that it was. Times have really changed since that first meeting.Lourdes Campos:	Well, the organic industry was just starting at that point.John Rivera Sedlar:	So actually at that time, people didn't understand about Latin food.Lourdes Campos:	No.John Rivera Sedlar:	They didn't understand about Mexican American food. They saw it as a sub level second quality as backseat cuisine. It's changed since then. Now people see it, that it's shoulder to shoulder with the other great kitchens, the other great cuisines of the world.Lourdes Campos:	What got you interested in the fusion?John Rivera Sedlar:	Well, my mother is Rosa Rivera. I grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but my father was in the Air Force. So we lived in Spain for three years as a very young child. I lived in France, but I don't remember too much of that. He was also stationed in Sacramento, in Utah, but we'd always go back to Santa Fe, where my Hispanic family were from. Always go back to the family fiestas, the holidays, Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner, where you would have chili both red and green with your turkey. You'd have chicos and posole, corns stews with your turkey. So I had this connection to being Latino, but because I had this background of extensive travel, everything was a mixture to me. Everything was Latino as an anchor. But then there was this layer of, ""Okay, what's the rest of the world doing?"" How are we going to filter my experience, my identity through Latino eyes and this fusion of the other things in the world.Lourdes Campos:	Was your mom a cook at the time or did you learn a lot from your mother?John Rivera Sedlar:	Not about cooking. My mother was a pretty good cook, [00:05:00] even though we jab her little bit that she was a modern '50s cook, meaning that it was the style of the times to be a modern cook. What did that mean? That mean frozen green beans, canned peas, TV dinners, onion soup with sour cream and dip. So she was a thoroughly modern cook and then the world rebelled. The advent of the farmers markets, people realized that organic was good, farm to table was good and now it's extreme. It's extreme sustainability. Everything that we're cooking, is it grown within a 100 miles from where we're at? Is it sustainable? Is that an endangered fish? Very conscious. Everybody is very food conscious these days.Lourdes Campos:	When did you decide to become a chef?John Rivera Sedlar:	Well, that was easy because growing up in Santa Fe, a very small town, there are only two jobs available for guys in high school. That was you either pumped gas at your local gas station or you worked in a restaurant. I happened luckily to land in the restaurant. There was a precursor diffusion in the restaurant I worked in, French food on one side and native specialties on the other side of the menu. Meaning on one side we had trout, almond amandine, and veal [inaudible 00:06:40] , and Lobster Newberg. On the other side of the menu, we had enchiladas with pinto beans and tacos with Cebolla Roja. So the foods had not combined. They were separate. But really it was, you could be at the same table, someone's having native specialties, someone else is having international food. So there it was starting to begin. The whole mixture of fusion was starting to begin.Lourdes Campos:	Then you came to California?John Rivera Sedlar:	Then I came to Los Angeles and America was trying to discover itself. The Bicentennial, the 200 year celebration of the discovery of American. Americans were soul searching, what is American, what is American fashion? What is American music? The Olympics, with its expression of the jazz that was played. The American jazz was to welcome the world at the opening ceremonies. There was a lot of curiosity about food. What is American food? People thought, is it gumbos from New Orleans, is it clam chowders from the Northeast? Is it salmon from the rivers of the Northwest? Historically, what I discovered, I did some research and what I discovered, the first historic cuisine of America was a Native American cooking of the Southwest, the Native American indigenous people. The things that were grown locally, the fish that was in the streams and the rivers, and that created America's first historic cuisine, very nourishing. Lot of nuts, berries, fruits and vegetables. Corn was a staple. Squash, beans and corn made the holy trinity of food, meaning that eaten together the nutrients were absorbed into the body, so as it was a very nourishing diet. Then it was very interesting that people wanted to discover what is American. So they started exploring these ingredients. What were the tortillas? What were their native vegetables? That was fine for about a decade.Lourdes Campos:	So the history of food became interesting to you?John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes. Doing research and finding out what the stories were, where did they evolve from, how food traveled and ingredients traveled, cooking techniques, utensils, processes. Looking into the American Southwest, that was the baby steps of my exploration of Latin food, Mexican-American, Spanish, South American, Caribbean. It's been a lifelong journey to educate people about those foods and those ingredients.Lourdes Campos:	[00:10:00] This is how the museum concept became part of your vision?John Rivera Sedlar:	Well, you had asked about the tamales and how we introduced our line of retail tamales. All the tamales had a masa base, the traditional masa. That is the backbone of all tamales from all Latin countries. But we introduced other ingredients, Japanese ingredients, Italian, Roma tomatoes, basil. We introduced other foods from the Caribbean, Asian ingredients like Norway seaweed, Chautauqua mushrooms. We introduced a lot of foreign ingredients into the traditional tamale. As people became more interested, they will ask more questions, we used to have tamale fiestas down at Mission San Juan Capistrano, the most beautiful of all the missions-Lourdes Campos:	Absolutely.John Rivera Sedlar:	-in California. It was a wonderful little Pueblo, a little microcosm of life here in Southern California. It had orchards and gardens. It had a wine making area. It had kitchens. It had three churches, a cemetery. All the things that happened in a person's life happened at that mission. We used to have tamale fiestas. Tamales were iconic symbols of community and family. They were always made at holidays, at fiestas, at weddings, baptisms, funerals. It was a real generous dish. We used to have fiestas at the Mission San Juan Capistrano. The director there said, ""You know what you should chef settler? You should produce exhibitions about the tamales you make, about the foods you use, what's their history, and present them here at the mission."" That was that little spark that has blossomed into the realization of creating an institution that celebrates Latin food.Lourdes Campos:	Did you have exhibits of the mission?John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes, we did. It was wonderful to produce exhibits and display them in the historic galleries there in the gardens. Also not just to show the photographs or the vitrines or the documented history of ingredients and processes. But then to actually in that mission, eat those foods.Lourdes Campos:	All right. It's beautiful.John Rivera Sedlar:	See the photographs, learn the history, and then eat the foods there. You were transported. There was such a beautiful, classic plaza of environment.Lourdes Campos:	It was a beautiful. You used to celebrate tamales there?John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes.Lourdes Campos:	Yes. I went to one of those.John Rivera Sedlar:	Oh, good.Lourdes Campos:	How long was that tamale?John Rivera Sedlar:	Oh, we made one of actually, the premier tamales of a region called Veracruz, one of the regional states of Mexico. They make a six-foot tamale. They're called the Zacahuil at all the highest holidays. It's a huge tamale, six feet long, full of various ingredients like duck and fish, and eggs, and potatoes, and pork, and chicken, and vegetables, and just full wrapped in banana leaves and cooked overnight. Then served to 100 or more people.Lourdes Campos:	It was wonderful. I enjoyed it.John Rivera Sedlar:	Oh good.Lourdes Campos:	From there you thought, let me bring this into a broader vision, and the museum concept began?John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes, it was percolated as you say. The more we talked, the more people volunteer to help, the more chefs that came on board that said, ""Will contribute our time and our dishes if you have an event to promote the museum, "" which it became known as Museum Tamal. Meanwhile, culturally, everybody was opening up everything, all their interests to Latin things, the music, the food, the fashion, the rich history, the travel. Everybody wanted to know, what is Latin? That included the food. As a Latino, as a Hispanic from the southwest of the United States, and having myself lived in Spain and [00:15:00] visited Mexico and South America, I got to meet a person, Lourdes Campos who was Cuban. I had never met a Cuban before. I didn't know what a Cuban was. It was very interesting as people were discovering, ""Well, all Latinos are not alike.""Lourdes Campos:	No. They're not. Very true.John Rivera Sedlar:	They think that everybody is Mexicano or everybody is from the Caribbean or everyone is Spanish or everybody's Argentine. No one knew the differences, the varieties of we as a Hispanic people have. I met this person, Lourdes Campos, yourself. I discovered this new layer, this new different cultural thing that was just had impeccable music, and what style and what architecture, and what pizzazz, and it was just a real eye opener for me, and meeting now your family, and at your family events at Christmas day.Lourdes Campos:	Nochebuena.John Rivera Sedlar:	Nochebuena.Lourdes Campos:	We roasted pig on Nochebuena.John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes, it was delicious, the crispy skin, and the depth of flavor, and the wonderful well-being, and excitement of all the family getting together. Don't forget also the paella.Lourdes Campos:	We do a paella cook off every summer.John Rivera Sedlar:	That wasn't-- was that? Is that traditionally Cuban?Lourdes Campos:	That's Spanish. Traditionally Spanish.John Rivera Sedlar:	That evolved then from traditions from Spain coming to Cuba and your family in Southern California and Culver City are keeping those traditions alive.Lourdes Campos:	Very true. But I think the Spanish culture, the Hispanic culture, the one thing, the beauty of it is the family. The family, that's one thing that I see from Mexicans, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Cubans family. Very important.John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes. Well, I see that in you. I definitely see that. Where does that come from?Lourdes Campos:	I think it's just that moment in time when you just know that your family always will be there for you. I think that's a very Spanish cultural connection. The whole food, you always gather within the food. Family, it's always a food environment. Everybody brings something, everybody enjoys each other's company. The food is the most important thing. With tamales, like you do the tamales, we do Nochebuena and the pig. You look forward to that day. All year around, you look forward to that day, and everybody makes an effort to be there. It's very important as a family to be there.John Rivera Sedlar:	I wonder where that comes from. If you think it comes really directly from the Spanish lineage?Lourdes Campos:	I think so.John Rivera Sedlar:	Maybe it's tribal.Lourdes Campos:	Could be too.John Rivera Sedlar:	Maybe it's nomadic and tribal of just keeping the core family together for protection, for survival, for sustenance.Lourdes Campos:	It's a beautiful story.John Rivera Sedlar:	Where do you think Lourdes, the violence comes from? The inherent Spanish. Everything is violent about Spain. The inquisition.Lourdes Campos:	The Conquistadores.John Rivera Sedlar:	The Conquistadores. The food is violent.Lourdes Campos:	The dance is violent.John Rivera Sedlar:	The dance is violent. The whole cultures is very-.Lourdes Campos:	Full of fighting.John Rivera Sedlar:	Very very. What do you think that aspect? Is that nomadical, so is that?Lourdes Campos:	Most probably very tribal. In Cuba, there's much of a connection with black culture and slavery. I think that has a lot to do with it and the Santeria, there's a blend of the Caribbean culture there and the struggle too. The Cubans that came here, the refugees having to struggle to make it in the United States. But very proud to be here. Very proud. There's a sense of pride within the Cuban culture to have America welcome them and open their arms to them and to their children, and their families. It was a very positive shift for the Cuban people. You growing up in Santa Fe, Mexican. Your mother was Mexican?John Rivera Sedlar:	My mother, that little I know, is Hispanic from Spanish lineage via Mexico. So what happened from Spain to Santa Fe is a gray area right now. We just don't know and I'd like to find out. [00:20:00] I'd like to find out where the family stopped, where it settled, how it eventually ended up in northern New Mexico. Northern New Mexico is a very isolated area of the United States. Very small, not a large population. It's not a heavily populated state and they've realized that in Northern New Mexico, in the pueblos, in the small hamlets that people speak more traditional Spanish, more Castilian Spanish. It's closer to the original Castilian and actually even in Spain. In Spain, with all the trade and international influence, the language, the true Castilian Spanish has been diluted. But in Northern New Mexico, it's been isolated and it's been preserved, and it's more true to what the original language was. So there is this direct lineage of Spain to Northern New Mexico and what I like to find out someday is really all the journey along the way, where were the stops, where did our families settle, what were the influences. We have a similar vernacular in Northern New Mexico. We use the same words, tamale, enchilada, taco, enfrijolada. But the sauces are very different and the chilis are different. We didn't have many fruits in Northern New Mexico. It wasn't this sort of rich micro climate that Mexico all of their micro climates from the oceans to the rivers, to the highlands, the low lands, mountains, deserts. There's so much variety of food that comes naturally from these areas. We don't have that in New Mexico. It's a high desert and we don't have the variety of vegetables or fruits. We have a lot of some fruits, nuts. We don't have the variety of fish. We have trout, we have crayfish in the streams, a little bit of salmon. So, we have a more limited menu in Northern New Mexico and it was definitely a corn based culture but it's amazing. Once people took the baby steps, what is Latin, what is Southwest, what are tortillas, what are chilis. Then the Latin palette opened. It wasn't what I was focused on the southwest, it became what are they eating in Mexico, what are they eating in South America, in Central America, what are they eating in Cuba, where those foods from, how did they migrate here. All of a sudden, Latin, which was perceived as an even California Mexican, Cal-Mex, was not really Mexican food and in California, when I first moved here, you'd go to a restaurant and they would say, we have a Spanish menu and it would be Mexican-American food. It was nothing about Spanish. But now with the variety of interests, people want regional Mexican food. They want Oaxacan food, they go oaxacan restaurant. They want Baja California style food. They want Veracruz styles of food. They want Southwest American, Brazilian, Argentine, Cuban. So everybody's starting to learn the nuances of the different dimensions and flavor profiles of all these kinds of regional foods.Lourdes Campos:	We are considering opening a museum that shows the history of how the food got here, how they intertwined or are you just doing exhibits, what's the concept or what's the idea behind the museum?John Rivera Sedlar:	That's very interesting question and very broad. It's interesting that at this time now in Los Angeles, there isn't a Hispanic museum. There's not a Latin museum. There is not a food museum. There isn't even the museum in our city about the history of Los Angeles. There isn't a repository of who we are and how we got here and there's a need for it. So, food seems to be a vehicle that everybody, all of us in our everyday lives can identify with. Not just on holidays, but we eat food two or three times a day, and we'd like to know what its source is, how it connects with us, [00:25:00] its preparation. People are wildly curious about how to cook now, what are the techniques and food's evolving. Food is being influenced by modern technology. It's evolving at a very rapid pace. So people are abreast. The advent of the TV Food Network demystified what the ingredients are, what the processes are, and it gave the everyday person the tools how to speak about food, how to talk about it. They say that the TV Food Network People don't necessarily cook more, but they know how to order in a restaurant.Lourdes Campos:	I know. It's true. I'm there.John Rivera Sedlar:	They know what questions to ask and they know sometimes more than their server knows. It's very interesting how passionate people are. So we can all readily identify with food.Lourdes Campos:	Well for me in Cuba, and I remember talking to you about this once was that one banana and it was fufu.John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes.Lourdes Campos:	Then mofongo and how that came to Cuba and we found out that it was through Africa, but just a Cuban staple, which is an interesting, to me, it was very interesting. That's similar to what you were telling me of how the Spanish brought certain items from Spain and integrated all that and it's an interesting way to look at history through the tall ships.John Rivera Sedlar:	Yeah.Lourdes Campos:	And the people coming to America.John Rivera Sedlar:	It is. It's sort of looking at history and culture but through a prism of food. How does food bring all this together and the food stories are fascinating. They're just fascinating. The galleons, and the slavery, and the migration of people, and the diaspora. It's a fascinating study. So our Museum is a repository of these food stories, but it's really looking at Hispanic Latin culture through culinary eyes, through the stories. Where did these foods come from in their natural state, what were the pre-Colombian ingredients, the reptiles, the eggs and the larvae, the mammals, the fruits, the vegetables. Where did they come from? The jungles, the ocean, sea side, the mountains, the plateaus. Who made these foods? Where were they made? Were they made in small villages in huts? Lots of these foods were made in huts. Were they made in the convents? The aristocracy, where they making these foods? The nuns in the convents, were they making these foods? What are the processes and what are the tools to use these foods, the metates, the molcajetes. How are they cooked, open fire? The chemistry of food. How did they discovered to preserve these foods to season them? So there's this broad story of where these foods came from, how they were produced, who made them and that's what our museum is about.Lourdes Campos:	It's a beautiful concept.MALE_1:	Can I ask a question? I'm really curious because I love the tamales. Can you describe what a perfect tamale for you is?John Rivera Sedlar:	Yes. Well, I don't know if there's a perfect tamale but tamales are very interesting and one, they're very symbolic of really something that's wrapped, it's a gift, it's a package and it's usually in a wrapper that is of a banana leaf or it's of a corn husk. It has traditionally, has been stuffed with corn, corn masa, sometimes sweetcorn. I, being Latino, love to have chili. I like a green chili or a red chili in a tamal. So it's something that's wrapped, it's something that's warm on the inside, it's very nourishing and satisfying. They were perfect dishes to travel with. They were originally, I think designed to be portable.Lourdes Campos:	A Latino sandwich.John Rivera Sedlar:	Exactly, yes. The sandwich of Latin America. Whatever you wrap it in really imparts the flavor into the masa itself. Whether it's a banana leaf or a corn husk or a green corn husk. Every culture has some sort of wrapped food, whether it could be a noodle, wrapped in a noodle or wrapped in a potato [00:30:00] dough of some kind. In East Europe, that's what they do there. So a tamale is something you put in your mouth and it goes straight towards your soul. It just is satisfying, it's comforting, it's the essence of spice and nourishing food. We've named our museum, Museum Tamal. Because every Latin American country has some form of tamal and they're all different. So every community, every region has nuances of flavor or seasoning or condiment that goes on top or the style in which they cook it or the style in which they wrap it or how it's cooked, whether it's baked, it's steamed, it's roasted, it's definitely a sort of identity of each pueblo, in each village, in each city, in each region, served at very high holidays.MALE_1:	I'm also really curious, just to get maybe a little more personal. Do you remember your first dish that you made or something that you made really well and can you describe it? Like from when you were a kid or something.John Rivera Sedlar:	Cooking has been an evolution and I always gravitated towards the kitchen. When I grew up in Northern New Mexico, my family had dirt floors. They had outhouses, dirt floors, wood stove, cooking tortillas and pots of beans on wood stores, it was extraordinary, it was an extraordinary way to disseminate heat over lots of pots and pans, it had a wonderful fragrance in the home. So I hung around the kitchens. I like being with the aunts and the tias and the abuelitas. When I found cooking, tamales are very tactile, they're very fun for children. Tamales, empanadas, tortillas, all these masa things that were so delicious, it was always fun to use your hands, to touch the food, to smell it as you're rolling it or as you're tucking it into a wrapping stuffings around it for empanadas, making chili serranos and smelling the roasted peppers. Where in Santa Fe and in Abiquiu, the whole valley in the fall, as people would roast their chilis that were just picked and ripened on the vine, they would all roast at the same time to freeze them for the winter. So the whole valley would smell this wonderful aromatic fragrance of pinion wood and chilis. So always hanging around in the kitchen and touching food and smelling it and being near the hearth, the heat of the stove and just learning how to nip and tuck in and fold and fry and boil and just touching all kinds of food, it was very fun being in the kitchen.MALE_1:	Anyone can answer this, you talk about how food has for both of you, like the trends of food have changed over the last decade. Where do you see things going maybe for Los Angeles as far as food and how conscious people are? What's the trend? Where is food headed?Lourdes Campos:	Well, for me I'm not there and I'm now a grandmother and I have to say that I would really like to see the home economics division of schools back. I think it's really sad that children don't know how to cook and it's the microwave world. So I would love to see the kids get more involved. Everything you just said about being a kid, being involved in the kitchen and creating and learning, that's completely lost now, kids just do not know how to do that and I think that's one of the reasons for the obesity issues. So I'd like to see that for children as a mother and as a grandmother come back. I would really see that as a positive for children in our age. You being in the restaurant world have a different perception of where the food's going in that direction. So I'll let you guide me on that one.John Rivera Sedlar:	Well, I have my own viewpoint. I don't think there's a right view point or a wrong viewpoint. [00:35:00] It's sort of very personal, where we are. I think that food is also, I was going to say a victim but it's involved in our go-go society right now. Where are we as a people? How do we assimilate information? At the rate that information travels now at the blink of an eye, food trends are changing. I'm 55, I've probably been through 15 food revolutions and there's new ones coming at us all the time, trends from around the world, how people are eating, how people are cooking. People look at Latin food or when we talk about our museum, they think that it might be a dusty old museum that's dark, that's a collection of broken fragments from an archaeological site and it's not, it's very vital. It connects with us, how we're eating today, how we approach food. There's a new Latin kind of food that's evolving right now called molecular gastronomy. So our museum looks at ancient foods but it's looking at how we cook food today and how we're going to be cooking food in the future. So it's very interesting that some of the original dishes that came to the America is from Spain. Now America is looking at Spain again where, this molecular gastronomy style is evolving. It's a new approach to food, Latin food. With Latin food, there's been this constant march forward towards lightness, lightening the sauces, lightning the oils, lightening of the salt, less cheese, less goopy cheese, little things for flavor and for good mouthfeel but not heavy. Molecular gastronomy is the next revolution, it's the next level that have some key cooking techniques that lighten these foods. One, for example, is called foam or vapor. Those are sauces. There are several kinds of foam, there's a kind of foam that has very small bubbles that are very tight like shaving cream. The concentration of a zhoug or vinaigrettes or sauces that are made into a light, airy shaving cream consistency type condiment. Then there's a different kind of foam which is like bubble bath, very concentrated, different size bubbles that you place over a sauce, I'm sorry, over a meat or fish and it's a different kind of foam. So there are these lighter sauces and then there's this verification process, the chalets, things that are savory, making them into gels, rosemary, herb flavored things, savory garnishes for dishes. There's a health component to this and there's a cooking process. These new dishes take different cooking techniques. Traditionally, cooking is very violent, especially to meats and fish. It dries out the flesh. A lot of the flavors dissipate. It contorts and toughens the meat and the muscles and the ligaments and the sinewy parts. There are different kinds of techniques, for example, sous vide, which takes these same kind of meats and it softens them and it pushes the flavors inwards and it concentrates the flavors. The flavors don't dissipate into the air, they don't dissipate into the oven, they don't dissipate into the poaching liquid, they're concentrated. So it's very exciting, this new horizon of gastronomy and I think it'll always continue. It started thousands of years ago, it's interesting, it's evolving at light speed. Our goal at the museum is not to go see things that happened decades or centuries before but it's to look at that in comparison with how we're eating today and to keep our pulse on what's going on around the world and what's nourishing, what's delicious, what's interesting, how can we eat these foods with our family? It's a great way to get through life, eating well, talking about food, drinking great spirits. There's nothing that can beat that.Lourdes Campos:	Thank you, John.John Rivera Sedlar:	Thank you Lourdes this was great fun.Lourdes Campos:	Sure.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
MBY006200,"FEMALE_1: [00:00:00] Enjoy.Christina Ramaya: My name is Christina Ramaya, and I'm 34 years old. Today is February 14, 2010, and we're in East Los Angeles, and I'm here today with my grandfather, Edgar Griffin. So, grandpa, can you tell us how old you are?Edgar Griffin: Well, I am 85 years old. And what else?Christina Ramaya: And today's date.Today's date. Actually, it's February 15. We forgot.FEMALE_1: It is. Not one second -- That one's correct.Christina Ramaya: Yesterday was the 14th.FEMALE_1: It's stuck on Valentine's.Edgar Griffin: So today's is 14 -- 15th.Christina Ramaya: The 15th.Edgar Griffin: What do we have to start with?Christina Ramaya: So, why I brought you here today is because I wanted to have a record of some of the stories that you've told me.FEMALE_1: They can hear it on the recording.Edgar Griffin: I'm sorry.FEMALE_1: No, it's okay. You wouldn't know that. The microphones are really sensitive.Edgar Griffin: Okay.Christina Ramaya: So, growing up, you've always told a lot of stories, and I want to be able to share these stories with my daughter as well. What I'd like us to talk about is a little bit about your background and your parents.Edgar Griffin: Okay. Well, first of all, I start with the school. I was born in Mexico, and I went to very good schools where they taught me pretty well. I was in elementary and -- After elementary, of course, in Mexico, it continues three years, we don't have junior high. But after that, I went to high school. After high school, I went to secondary or which is here equivalent to a year in college. And then after college, I went to -- I'm speaking too close.Christina Ramaya: You're fine.FEMALE_1: Yeah, just a little bit further away is perfect.Edgar Griffin: Okay, and then I went to college and graduated in the second year. By this time, I was already 14 years old. My father had passed away and my mother decide for me to come to the United States, which I came in 1939 at Los Angeles, and I've been here since. I established myself here. I continued the school here, except that I was too far ahead from my schooling in Mexico that I didn't have to go to high school. I did go to high school here, but only to get the certificate from Poly High School. After that, I went to U.S.C. After I have finished two years of college here, from U.S.C., I went to Hughes Aircraft and worked for Hughes Aircraft testing radar units for fighter planes. After that, I went to work for R.C.A. R.C.A., I was there 15 years. After R.C.A., I went to Western hotel at the Century Plaza, and I was there 25 years. So, that's very, fundamentally speaking, my beginning. I think that the highlights of my life has been the experience that I went through in the army, and that is a very hard situation for me to talk. But since we are on the subject, I will tell you that in the Army I was not only there, but with the same questions of everyone that I knew asking me, ""How come you last name is Griffin?"" I used to tell them, ""Well, you have to ask my dad about it, because my dad is the one that brought me in,"" and in reality, I'm half-and-half.FEMALE_1: So, why were they asking you that?Edgar Griffin: [00:05:00] Well, it's very unusual for me to, especially with my accent, very difficult for me to explain the difference being my last name Griffin. And as you know, it's not a Latino name, it's not a Mexican last name, so that's that is one of my main questions all through my life, including when I got married, when I got my family and so on. Now, I think that one of the highlights in the Army was that --FEMALE_1: Tell Christina.Christina Ramaya: Tell me, grandpa.Edgar Griffin: I'm sorry.FEMALE_1: That's okay.Christina Ramaya: It's okay.Edgar Griffin: One of the highlights in the army was my status. I went to Camp Roberts, California, and I went through the infantry training, which was 17 weeks and I finished. And after that, I was already assigned to go overseas. Now, since I came to the United States when I was young, and when my mother decided to send me and so on, it was difficult for me to see her, because I don't have any brothers or sisters or anybody else but myself and my mother. That's all I had at the time, and I was already in the army, ready to go overseas. I wanted to stay a little longer in the States, but they wouldn't allow me because I was assigned to go out.Christina Ramaya: How old were you at the time?Edgar Griffin: Well, I was 18 years old, and my buddies at camp, they used to see me that I was worried and I didn't want to go, and they took it wrong. They thought that I was afraid or I was a coward and I didn't want to go overseas, it wasn't that at all. What it was really, was that I was asking for a little more time to stay on the States, while my mother was making arrangements to come into the United States since she was living in Mexico City. The time came that, no matter what I did, I couldn't get out of that. They told me, ""No matter what you do, once you are written to go and [inaudible 00:07:51] to overseas, they can just not take you out of there."" I created a reputation that my buddies thought that I was afraid of going overseas.Edgar Griffin: Now in the meantime, I went one day to a doctor to check me out because I had a headache, I forgot exactly what it was, and I told him my sad story. So this doctor said to me, ""Oh no,"" he says, ""You can stay a little longer in the state and maybe by then your mother would be here and you get to see her."" ""Oh that was nice,"" I said, ""Well, what can I do?"" ""Oh,"" he says, ""All you have to do is volunteer in the Airborne and they'll take you out of that list immediately and they send you to go overseas."" Well, I decided to do that even though the doctor when he asked me that question was like asking me stand in front of that wall, we're going to shoot you. But it wasn't that bad really, and I joined the Airborne, and, naturally, they took me out of the packet, and I went to Fort Benning in Georgia for Airborne training. Now, this is a beautiful thing about this, that when I was able to go into the airborne, my buddies that thought that I was a coward and this and that, they saw my name on the bulletin, that I was the only one on the whole battalion, and that means about 400 men, that volunteer going into the airborne as a paratrooper. So, I took that job and naturally they took me off the list and they send me to Fort Benning in Georgia. [00:10:00] I took my training there and when I was there, I was lucky again. I didn't have to go to infantry training since I already had it at Camp Roberts. So, they just put me ahead with the jumping class of airborne, and I went and got my paratroopers wings after I jump five times in training.Christina Ramaya: So, that gave you more time in the United States, going to the paratrooper training?Edgar Griffin: That allowed me to be in the States a little more time, and, especially, my mother was able to come, and I got to see her. And of course, my buddies then they realized that it wasn't that I was afraid at all from going overseas. That's what I liked. Then of course, my mother came and I went to see her and so on.Christina Ramaya: I remember you telling me something about a letter that you wrote.Edgar Griffin: Yes I'm coming to that.Christina Ramaya: Okay.Edgar Griffin: When I was in training, I was telling this story to one of my buddies, about my mother not being able to fix her papers to come through. At that time, it was very critical to come into the United States. Even though my mother, by rights, she was an American citizen. She married my dad in 1919, and at that time, anybody that marry an American citizen, the wife automatically became American citizen. So she was actually American citizen, but they gave my mother a hard time at the border and told her that she couldn't come in, because when my father died, the immigration sent her a letter for her to retain her citizenship if she wanted to. But at that time, we were pretty well set in Mexico, and she didn't realize that one day, sooner or later, she would like to come to the United States. So, she didn't put attention to the letter and the letter was misplaced and forgotten. That letter would have helped her to come into the United States immediately, but immigration wouldn't let her come through.Edgar Griffin: Now, due to all of these facts, I had this advice from this buddy of mine, and he tells me, ""Why don't you write a letter to Mrs. Roosevelt?"" I said, ""Mrs. Roosevelt?"" I said, ""No. She's the wife of the president. She's not going to put any attention on me on that."" He says, ""Why don't you try, you can't lose anything."" So I did write a letter to Mrs. Roosevelt, and she did answer immediately. She answered to the Philadelphia Headquarters of Immigration, and according to her letter, she just scold them and told them that they have no right to stop my mother coming into the United States, being an American citizen, that she wanted the agents from the immigration to go after my mother immediately and let her come through to the United States, which is what happened. The counsel of the town in Tijuana went for my mother and told her that she could come into the United States anytime she wanted to.Edgar Griffin: My mother was flabbergasted and she says, ""You mean I can go now?"" He says, ""Yes."" He says, ""You can go right now if you want to."" Well, right away she packed up her bag and they gave her a ride to the station, and she came into Los Angeles. She wrote me a letter telling me that she was in Los Angeles and I was so happy because not only that, at camp I had a leave of two weeks and they allowed me to come, and I got to see her before I went overseas. And better yet, in that camp I was assigned to go overseas to Europe, and I was assigned to be a replacement in one of the most famous units, fighting units of the United States, The Screaming Eagles, The 101st Airborne. Well, [00:15:00] I was so happy. So, that was the highlight of my particular story. Now, one of the important things is that nowadays things have changed and I can't believe that I'm still sitting here talking to you, telling you about it, and I landed on D-Day in Normandy, and I lasted three months in combat. And I was decorated and so on. And from then on it was easy going, easy sailing. I did had a very good life even though there was hit a couple of times, but not seriously like other buddies of mine that didn't even come back. But I've been now, on these later years, I met so many good buddies that's still alive, that have survived all these things of the war, especially one that he was a prisoner of war in Japan for 40 years. He's named Bill Sanchez, one of my best buddies. And other than that, life has been good to me because not only have a beautiful family. At the end of this interview, I will tell you the family I have, I'm in front of one of my favorites. I got to be very thankful, really. People nowadays don't have any idea of what it is to be free, and I do. I know what it is. Anyway, you didn't ask me anything at all.Christina Ramaya: No, because you're so good at telling.Edgar Griffin: Well, I got so many things in life. Another highlight of my life is being a member of the Knights of Columbus because I learn a lot from them. Then of course, the other organizations like the American Legion and the Foreign -- I forgot, what would you call it a foreign? Well, these are not organizations.Christina Ramaya: VFW, right?Edgar Griffin: VFW, that's the one. So that's the two that I belong to. There are so many other things that could I mention here that I can recall. But the most important ones are the ones that I just got telling you about. I hope I didn't confuse you. I tried to be as clear as possible.Christina Ramaya: Grandpa, what about, I remember you telling me a story of when you went with your father in-law and when he went to go buy a new car.Edgar Griffin: Oh, yes.Christina Ramaya: Tell us a little bit about your father-in-law.Edgar Griffin: Sure. My father-in-law was one of the old timers of East Los Angeles. As a matter of fact, he's the one that brought the chorizo to Los Angeles. He had a big store, and he has a packing house and he manufactured chorizo, as much as 25 to 30,000 pounds. He used to mail to Fresno and places where Mexican people would be looking for chorizo. At the same time he made chicharron, which is cracklings. In those days, he used to make them 25 pounds a bag, which you can imagine cracklings on a 25 pound bag is a large, bulky thing. But anyway, he had trucks going up to Fresno loaded with those bags. My father-in-law was very active and very well known in East Los Angeles. His name was Salvador Dominguez. [00:20:00] As a matter of fact, right now some of the packing houses that make chorizo, they deviate from him because he is the one that leased equipment to some of these companies like La Colonial, Carmelita, I can name a few, but I don't remember the rest of them.Christina Ramaya: He was pretty successful?Edgar Griffin: He was very successful, my father-in-law. And very shrewd man in business. He liked me a lot too, and he made good money. One time he mentioned that he wanted me to take him to buy a car. I said, ""But Salvador, I mean, don't you want to change? "" Because he would be walking around in a t-shirt full of grease, and he didn't have a shirt or a tie or nothing. He just wanted to go to the best dealer in Los Angeles to buy a car. He says, ""Those little car, are they fast or aren't they?"" I said, ""Yes, they are fast."" So he says, ""I want one of those."" Okay, so we went over, and the way he was dressed, we walked into the show floor where the cars were displayed, and the salesman didn't even look at us. Because he saw me look like a bomb -- worse than a bomb. But anyway, he looked at the car, and in those days, the little cars were famous, the English cars. It was a GMC and they have a Jaguar Sport Racer in display. In those days the Jaguar, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the only one in Los Angeles in 1952. So he says, ""I like that one. That car must go very fast."" I said, ""Yeah, it does go fast."" He says, ""Call the salesman. Tell him I'd like to buy this car."".Edgar Griffin: So I call the salesman and I said,""Sir, my father-in-law likes to purchase this car."" They had a big sign in front of the car for $7,000. In those days, 7,000 for a sport car was very much. So the salesman looked at us and he says, ""Do you want to buy this car?"" He says, ""Yes."" The salesman looks at my father-in-law and he says, ""How do you intend to take care of it?"" ""Well, I think I have enough in my pocket, but if not, we go to my place of business, I give you the rest, whatever is needed."" He pulls me aside, the salesman, he says, ""What is his business?"" Oh, it's just a small business. He's got a small packing house in East Los Angeles. ""Oh, yes. What is he going to do, trade the car or what?"" ""Well, he's got an old car parked out there,"" and that other car that is in front and it was a brand new Chrysler. He says, ""And that's his car, but he don't want it. He wants a small that can go fast."" He looks at the car, ""He doesn't want to trade that, does he?"" ""No, he just wants to keep it as a spare. He don't want that car. He wants the one you got there in display."".Edgar Griffin: So, he says, ""Okay, step in the office."" From then, that salesman changed entirely. He was very polite and very courteous and everything. So my father-in-law, he says, ""How much is it?"" I said, ""Well, it's about $7,000."" Okay. So he starts taking money out of his pocket, all kinds of bills, big and small bills, puts them all in the table, and he tells the sales man, ""Start counting."" So, he had almost the whole thing, but not all of it. So they had to come to the place of business. The salesman was interested in looking at this place. So anyway, he bought the car and he used to go every week to Tijuana. He used to take the servicemen, give them a ride. Some servicemen wouldn't want to drive with him because he was very careless and very fast driver. [00:25:00] Someone said to let him off. They didn't want stay in the car. He was funny. He was real nice father. That's the story of my father-in-law.Christina Ramaya: So  speaking of cars, you told me once that grandma drove a very fancy car.Edgar Griffin: Yeah, well, he always had fancy cars, my father-in-law, but very seldom -- He took -- They took trips. The family never took trips, but they did had this lady, they used to take care of her and she was a nun and she used to come and take care of my mother-in-law when she was ill, and I used to take her in the morning and then in the evening.The only thing is that she wouldn't go on the sport car that he just bought. He would go on the Chrysler. But she wouldn't sit with me. She'd sat in the back, the nun. ""No. No, Mr. Griffin, I'll sit in the back."" I would take her back to the convent, and she settled in the back. Any other?Christina Ramaya: Well, when you first met grandma?Edgar Griffin: When I first met -- Oh, I met grandma at Sears. She was the head cashier, and before I went into the army, I was partly working as a house boy and then partly working in selling newspapers and delivering. Finally, I got a job as a shipping clerk at Sears in East Los Angeles, and I met my wife there. I met Mimi and she was very good looking, one of the best looking girls in the whole store. I met her and we got married, that's it.Christina Ramaya: What attracted you to grandma?Edgar Griffin: Huh?Christina Ramaya: What attracted you to grandma?Edgar Griffin: Well, what did attract me was that she was very reserved. She wasn't the happy-go-lucky girl that went all over the place and -- No, she didn't even look at me sometimes. She's very straight. I wonder if she's mad or something. But way deep, I guess she cared for me and I cared for her, and that was it. We stayed so long that she gave me a big family, she gave me 7 of you daughters and 2 boys, 9 altogether, which brought me to 23 grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren. So that's my family. Of course, I'm very proud of all of them because every one of them is in very good shape. They took advantage of the school, and they learned as much as possible, because nowadays education is what brings you up. If you don't know nothing, you're just not going to do nothing unless you going to do labor work, and labor work is hard to do. But anyway, that's the important thing, to have an education, at least enough to make, I would say nowadays you have to make 90 or 100,000 a year. If you don't make that, I guess that you have to struggle.FEMALE_1: What was your wife's name?Edgar Griffin: My wife's name was Mary Griffin, but her nickname was Mimi.Christina Ramaya: How did the nickname Mimi come about? When did people start calling-Edgar Griffin: That nickname of Mimi was given to her by her mother and her aunt Elorita. They called her Mimi because, well, she was just like mimi. She was very mimi, very nice. Well, I don't have to tell you, you knew her and she was wonderful, she was a person that wouldn't hurt a fly. As a matter of fact, that's probably why we lasted 63 years. She never even asked me how much money I make, she didn't even know how [00:30:00] much money I made, she didn't even ask me about, what is the check? Why didn't you pay this? I need this for that. Never. She didn't even ask me to buy a dress. She always for some reason manage herself to have everything without having to ask me, that's how good your grandma was. She was wonderful. I don't know if I spoke clearly or not but.Christina Ramaya: You're fine, Grandpa. You're fine.Edgar Griffin: You have to excuse me because I'm very emotional and sometimes I can't hold it. Is pretty hard sometimes when they ask me to talk to people, especially when we go to schools and we talk to students I can't mention my wife because I burst crying. The same thing in some of the things that happened in the war, very, very hard things that all of you have no idea of how hard it was to see all the atrocities that I saw with all those people that we were fighting. Well, that's another story anyway.Christina Ramaya: When you were in the war, what would be something that would help you get through the day when you saw some of those atrocities?Edgar Griffin: Well, I'll tell you, nothing never came across to help me go through the day. In the army I got lost from my unit for two days and I was wandering all over the place. I didn't know if I was walking against the enemy or the enemy was on the right or the left of me or nothing and I'll be truthful with you. During the time of the war, my main thing was looking for cover, running from one place to the other, making us comfortable as possible, the fox hole or the trench or whatever we had to dig to make it at least livable for a couple of hours, especially if it was raining. There is no place exactly to choose. They ask you to stop, you stop. They ask you to dig, you dig. They ask you to volunteer, you volunteer and your life is just nothing. You're just expecting to be killed at any time, and I was like that for about three months after the jump in Holland. After the jump of D-Day in Holland is when I got hurt. In Holland, the jump was easy because during the day, there was no darkness. We could see each other. It was a nice feeling coming down on the parachute and turning around to the right or left and you see a whole bunch of soldiers next to you coming down the same way. You felt good. But during the invasion on D-Day, everything was in the dark and always is flare after flare, and the bullets just passing by you and you can feel them when they pass you. They are swinging right next to you, and you were just waiting to see if you would hit and get hit. Fortunately, on the jump on Normandy, I didn't get hit at all, not a scratch, but three months later I did in Holland and that was that. I was very fortunate that I wasn't part of the big battle that they had in Bastogne after the jump in Holland. I was in the hospital at the time when that happened. So I'm grateful for that, why I'm still here sitting and talking about all those things. But someone was looking after me and I know that for sure. The prayers of the family, my mother, your mother, everybody. So everybody help us to go through and I went through and I'm still here hoping [00:35:00] for the time that our Lord picks me up. So that's that. Are there anymore questions, Christina?Christina Ramaya: Well, looking back at your life, and your family, and everything that you've been through, what are you the most proud of?Edgar Griffin: What am I the most proud of?Christina Ramaya: What would you want to be remembered by?Edgar Griffin: What would I what?Christina Ramaya: Want to be remembered by?Edgar Griffin: Well, I just want to be remembered that they won't forget me.Christina Ramaya: We won't forget you.Edgar Griffin: It's just like yesterday when I visited in San Diego, that aircraft ship, they told me when you get out there, you ask them questions and it turned out the opposite way. They saw me and they were asking me, and one question that they asked me, it was very funny. This fellow was in front of the airplane, and I saw him and I said, ""are you the pilot?"" He says, no, and then he says, ""but let me ask you a question,"" and he looks at my cap and my decorations and he says, ""what make you jump off of the plane?"" I said, ""well, I tell you, the reason why I jump off the plane is because I'm an idiot,"" and he laugh. I said, yeah, well, you're an idiot, really. I think one of the worst parts of jumping off of the plane is the first time, the time you leave the plane, that's it. To me, that's the hardest thing because you walk into a storm once you leave the door of the airplane. You're up against the plane going at a certain speed, maybe 200 miles an hour, maybe 250, I don't know, and you jump off and the minute you jump off, you get caught by the wind, the air, the storm, and that one is another thing that pushes you. You're supposed to turn on five seconds from the time you leave the plane and at the end of the five seconds, you feel that pull, that jerk from the parachute that opens. But I didn't get a chance to count to five seconds at all. So you just went over and hope for the jerk pull of the parachute. Now when the parachute opens, and that's different. If you're lucky enough, that it's good weather you come down very smooth, but if it's windy, you would be swinging and instead of landing in your feet, you probably would land in your head, or your stomach, or whatever. It's very hard to tell, because you don't realize how fast you're coming down. When you get close to the ground, you see really that you're coming fast. If you're swinging, it's hardest, because you've got to prepare yourself to hit. But anyway, before you do all of that, you go through a very rigorous training in which they show you what you're supposed to expect, and it is true you expect all of that that they prepare you with. But sometimes the training is a lot harder than the actual act when you take the jump or whatever.Christina Ramaya: Our time is almost up.Edgar Griffin: Our time is almost up?Christina Ramaya: Yeah.Edgar Griffin: Okay.Christina Ramaya: But I want to thank you for telling us your stories.Edgar Griffin: Oh, you're welcome. I said I'm glad to do it. This interview is important for the future, for the family, especially all of your brothers, and cousins, and everything that you have. I wish that your mom would still have that place for we could all get together, but now it is very difficult to get 50 people at one time in Thanksgiving [00:40:00] or Christmas, or any well-known party, religious party, or birthday, or whatever.Christina Ramaya: Yeah. I just wanted you to be able to share some of your history with our family, because not everyone has heard as many stories.Edgar Griffin: I know there is so many things that I could be talking, but we'll be here all day, all night, and there's so many. The ones that are serious are the ones that I don't want to speak about it, but I do want to give you a hint. You don't want to forget all those people that suffer so much in those prisoner camps. I saw so much atrocities that it's hard to describe. We are on a situation where we're constantly against that, but if this nation get smart and be good people, we would be able to go over that. I just give advice to all the people that are still alive and hope that they'd be nice to their neighbors and especially the drivers. We had to have patience with the drivers, because there are so many drivers that think they own the road and they cut in front of you, make a left turn and things that I don't have to tell you. You know about that.Christina Ramaya: Okay. Well, thank you grandpa for spending the time today with us.Edgar Griffin: Okay honey. Bye.Christina Ramaya: Thank you. Bye.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
MBY006202,"Pascolita Morales: [00:00:00] Okay.FEMALE_1: [inaudible 00:00:00].Pascolita Morales: Pascolita Morales. I'm 31 years old. Today's date is February 15th, 2010, we're in East Los Angeles, California, and I am the daughter of Maria Morales.Maria Morales: Maria Morales. I'm 50 years old. Today is February 15th, 2010. We're in East LA and I am the mom of Patty Morales.Pascolita Morales: So mom, can I ask where and when were you born?Maria Morales: I was born here in East LA, down the street, on Dozier Street. I was born on August 15th, 1951.Pascolita Morales: Where did you grow up?Maria Morales: I grew up in the same house. I lived there until I was about 16 years old. It's in Maravilla.Pascolita Morales: What was it like?Maria Morales: Well, the house itself was a regular A-frame house. I guess originally it was listed as a four-bedroom house, but down the line, my parents divided it into two houses. So it had two living rooms, two bedrooms, two kitchens, and two bathrooms. It was in the middle of the block. My mom had a whole bunch of flowers out in the front and a big old chicken coop in the back.  There's a garage that they converted also into additional living space. Basically Maravilla, at that time, there was a lot of gang activity, there was a lot of violence going on. But where we lived, it was very safe. We had a lot of neighbors and our neighbors had a lot of kids, so we were always playing in the street and everybody knew everybody. It was just a really nice place to grow up in.Pascolita Morales: Why did your parents divide the house into two living quarters?Maria Morales: Well, because it was so many of us. I have 12 brothers and sisters, of that, 10 were living at the time. Even though some of them had already been married and had their own families, they still lived there with my mom and dad. So it's not only her own children, but also in-laws and their children. So we didn't even have to go to a party anywhere or even go out. Just playing there at the house was enough. That's why they divided it into two, and even after they divided it, the back house, which was the garage, they added on another room and there was more family living back there.Pascolita Morales: Have you been by there? Is it still the same way?Maria Morales: It doesn't look the same. I do go by periodically because I'm very familiar with the area and I don't live too far from here. So I like to -- to me going down, I still call it Brooklyn Avenue, even though it's Cesar Chavez Avenue going down Brooklyn. A lot of times when I was working downtown LA, to avoid the traffic on the freeway, I would just cruise down Brooklyn and you always get a sense of security, going down. The church is still there, La Soledad, it's been there since, I guess, in the early '20s, the two bakeries, La Fama and El Gallo, they've been there since the '20s also. The stores are basically all the same. The house itself, from the outside, it looks the same. I have no idea what they did to the inside. They did knock down the garage and the other room that they had in the back, and the chicken coop is long gone.Pascolita Morales: Who were your parents?Maria Morales: My father was Angel De La Rosa and he was born on August 2nd, 1902, and my mom was Maria Gonzales. She was born on May 25th, 1908. My dad was born in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and my mom was from Guadalajara, Jalisco.Pascolita Morales: What did they do for a living?Maria Morales: They did a variety of things. Actually, they did anything that would generate money to support such a large family. They were the original entrepreneurs, whatever they did to make money, there was no holds barred. My mom made tortillas, she made tamales. My dad was a fruit peddler. They had a store. We used to go to Northern California, [inaudible 00:04:34] we would pick cotton, tomatoes, grapes. My dad, hitting the almond trees with a big sledgehammer. He would hit these almond trees and put a tarp on the bottom of the floor. Then we would all go like little mouses and little munchkins and picking up all these almonds and put them in a bucket. That was what [00:05:00] they did. They did whatever they could, they sold junk, they would pick up junk in the street and they turn around and sell it, you name it, they did it. They weren't educated per se. They didn't have one main occupation, but they were able to sustain a large family until they died.Pascolita Morales: What was your relationship like with your parents?Maria Morales: Actually, it was pretty good. I was the youngest one. So I was, ""the baby"". I was the spoiled one. I guess it helped that I was a good girl and I didn't merit any beatings or abuse that maybe some of the others felt that they did and stuff. My mom basically was the disciplinarian in the family and she just looked at you. If you would misbehave, she gave you a look. If you still misbehave, she gave you a hand, ""vas a ver."" And by that time if -- you deserve whatever your got. My dad, he lost his voice box when he was really young. So he could talk, but you couldn't hear him. He would just resort to beating when you got him upset with you, he was just being mad and stuff. But because I was a good child like you are, it was just a really good relationship with them. I was always with my mom 24/7 till I got married, I guess. Yeah.Pascolita Morales: Tell me about your siblings and what they were like growing up.Maria Morales: Oh, God. Well, there was a whole bunch of us. By the time I came around, a lot of the older ones were already married and had moved away or were living there, but they had their own little rooms with their own families and stuff. I have four brothers, Tony, Juan, Angel, and Emmanuel, and I grew up closer to Angel and Emmanuel. I was more towards their age. There was such a big gap. It was like one boy, four girls, one boy, four girls and then two boys, and then myself. I had more of a rapport with the younger ones though, I would say from Carmen down. Carmen and Margaret and Angel and Emmanuel and myself, we more or less grew up together. They were like any other siblings, they were forever fighting. It seems like they were fighting for food a lot of the times. When we were little, we were all really little, we all still lived at home, they were all really close and they all more or less took care of each other. Then when they got older, they had their own families. They went off on their own, but we would still get together quite often for gatherings and baptisms and birthday parties and such.Pascolita Morales: You mentioned that grandpa would get angry with some of the other ones, but you were pretty good, what kind of trouble did they get into?Maria Morales: Do you really want to know? I'll just tell you one story in particular. I was about three years old and my brother Emmanuel was about five. We lived there at Dozier and my parents had a tortilleria, and it was on -- off of Brooklyn, but they called it [inaudible 00:08:23]. [inaudible 00:08:25] is that dip that goes beyond Eastern. If you keep going further down about another three or four blocks, it reaches an area where it's flat and then it starts climbing up again. So it was a distance from the house, it was well over a mile. We were hungry, we were both hungry and we hadn't eaten, and my sisters had this habit that my mom and dad would go off to work at the store and they would leave the kids with the older daughters, mainly it was Carmen and Margaret. As soon as my parents left, they would throw us out. They would throw us out in the street all day long. We'd be looking through the window and we could see them with a fan on, watching TV, eating, and the rest of us were outside fending for ourselves and stuff. Right before it got dark, before my parents came home, they would bring us into the house and they would wash us up and feed us. So it appeared that we were well being taken care of, and we weren't. So this particular day Emmanuel and I, he was about five and I was about three, we walked from the house on Dozier, all the way to where the store was, because we knew how to get there. My dad came across us right before we got to where they were working. He wanted to know what we were doing there, and we told him we were hungry and we wanted to eat. So they put us in the car, and he went and got my mom and they went back to the house and they told us to wait in the car, [00:10:00] and they walked in the house and the girls were surprised that they were home. The first thing they asked them was, ""Where's Angel?"" I don't know where Angel was at, they used to call me Mary at that time, ""Where is Mary and Emmanuel?"" ""They're outside playing."" They kept on calling us, ""Mary, Emmanuel, Mary, Emmanuel."" We wouldn't respond at all, and they kept on pressing them, ""Where are they? Where are they?"" Finally, my mom came out saying that they had found us down at the corner, and where they found us and they gave them a beating that I don't think they ever forgot. Then they had us come out of the car and tell them what had happened and stuff. But it didn't matter, the next day they still threw us out, I guess it didn't hurt that much. But those are some of the things that they did.Pascolita Morales: What did you look like when you were Mary?Maria Morales: Oh, God. Well, I was short. I think was the same -- I remember my mom used to make me these dresses out of the, she used to buy flour from, it was called La Piña flour. It was 25 pounds a sack and it was a paisley print. After she used the flour, she used to make me hand made dresses from that, and she used to put these big ole hems on them so that when I would grow, I could just fit into them. I never grew. So I was really short, I was dark, I had long straight hair. I looked Asian. They used to call me Japonesa. That was a nickname my mom would give me because she said I looked more Japanese than Mexican and stuff. But I was real tiny, real petite.Pascolita Morales: Now, do you think you were a happy child growing up?Maria Morales: I think so. I was happy, I was happy up to a certain point. I think I was the happiest when I was really, maybe till about 10, 11 years old. I was happy because we had a lot of people and they were in the house and it seemed like we were always doing something, either playing with a cousin or a nephew or in the block or something rather. The daytime, we were always working. It didn't seem to us like it was a job. We did do a lot of work. But then my dad started drinking, and once he started drinking, it just turned sour. The happiness somewhat went away and my brothers and sisters moved out. It was just the younger ones that were left behind. My mom was always at work and she was very successful in her business. She had that tortilleria that she built up from scratch. I think with my dad, I think he was going through a midlife crisis that if he didn't do things now, he was never going to get them done. At the same time, she was so strong and so independent that I think he just felt that he wasn't needed anymore. So he started drinking pretty heavily and they got into a lot of fights and it got ugly and stuff. So those were the unhappy times. But there was more happy times than unhappy times.Pascolita Morales: Now, are you comfortable telling how grandma got her tattoo?Maria Morales: I guess I am. My mom was pretty unique. I'll say she was very strong. She was a little feisty little thing. I guess my dad was somewhat of a womanizer and she knew it. From what I understand with the stories they tell me is that when my dad was younger, he didn't really drink, but he was a womanizer, there's no doubt about that. So I guess he came home one day with some initials of somebody on his arm and she asked him who those initials were and then he said they were from his girlfriend. So then she went and got a tattoo done, just initials out of nowhere. She picked them out, and he asked her who those were and she told him, ""They're my boyfriend's."" So there. But that's the way she was. She was just very feisty, very independent, and she wasn't going to let herself by anybody, and if that's what it took, that's what she did.Pascolita Morales: I love that. I remember growing up and seeing those initials on grandma's forearm and always thinking they were some amazing story of her growing up in some camp where they made her do it. To find out that she did that on her own to make grandpa jealous is pretty funny.FEMALE_1: Did you ever ask her?Pascolita Morales: I never. She only spoke Spanish and I spoke Spanish when I was really little but, growing up, I was focused more on the food items, huevos, and -- and my mom would sit down with my grandma [00:15:00] for hours in their kitchen, a small kitchen in the back, talking and I would play outside with my cousins. So then when we leave, I hear all the stories on the car ride home about what was going on, all the gossip in the neighborhood, but I never really sat down with grandma to ask her.Maria Morales: Yeah. She didn't really talk much about it. I think she was more embarrassed about it later on, because it's a tattoo and you can't get rid of it. Now I guess you can, but back then you couldn't. She wasn't proud of it after a while, but it's a done deal. But she showed him.Pascolita Morales: Do you have a best memory of your childhood?Maria Morales: A best memory of my childhood. No. The best memories I had was when we used to go up north, [inaudible 00:15:55] even though it was work and it was hard work. It's just, again we were always together and there we were really in a one-room house that is like, it was in a boarding house. It was the homes that they would provide to the migrant workers. We always had number 21. I don't know why my dad always picked that house, but we always had 21. It was further towards the back, but closer to the restrooms. It had a pot belly stove. You could see through the wooden lats of the frame of the house and it only had two or three windows. But every summer, every May, they would gather all of us up to pull us out to school and put us in this old woody car that he had and he would drive over there. I always sat in the front of the car, not in the back with all the others. We were there from May all the way till about the end of October. Right before Halloween, they would always bring us back and then put us back in school. But I guess, even though we worked harder and we worked the long hours, again, we were always together. It's just that that feeling of security was there, that they were going to take care of you and no matter what, you didn't have to worry and stuff.Pascolita Morales: Is that why family and spending time together is so important now for you?Maria Morales: It's true, it is. It's very important for me because that's one of the things my mom taught me. My mom taught me that you have to take care of your family. You don't abandon your family. It's not only your responsibility, but if you don't take care of your family, nobody else will. You can work, you can go to school, you can give up your life to other things, and those are things that might bring you satisfaction and things, but family is an intangible thing that you can't give up. If you don't have it, if you don't enjoy it, if you don't take care of it, then nobody else will. But she was the patriarch of the family and she took care of not only her kids, but her grand kids, anybody that came to her, she would take care of them. I guess that's just a gift that she passed on to me. I recently found out that I guess my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, my mom wasn't very close to her. I think that's why my mom was close to her kids. She just wanted to have that closeness, that tightness with them and stuff.Pascolita Morales: What kind of a student were you growing up?Maria Morales: I was a good student. I went to Brooklyn Avenue School and I was a very good student. I did really well in math, not too well in English. English being the second language, I just didn't learn that growing up, especially grammar and all that other stuff. Then I went to La Soledad Catholic Elementary School for the seventh and eighth grade. My mom didn't want me to go to Griffith Junior High because she had seen how everybody else had turned out and wanted to provide me better opportunities. Then I went to Our Lady Queen of Angels in downtown LA, which was a totally different experience in itself. That was also a very good school. They provide you with a lot of opportunities there.FEMALE_1: So were they paying for the school?Maria Morales: Yes, they were.FEMALE_1: They were working that hard to be able to.Maria Morales: Right. It was strange, the first five kids were born here in the United States and then [00:20:00] the next five were born in Mexico. Then they came back, and then the last three were born here. When they came back, that's when they put the kids in school. The ones that were born in Mexico were the ones that didn't really finish school. Some of them didn't really go. So the ones that were here, the ones who were really young when they got here or they were born here, they were the ones that had the opportunities to go through and stuff.Pascolita Morales: What do you think was different about you than some of your brothers and sisters that helped you become successful, or I guess definitely a success story for East LA?Maria Morales: Education. Believe it or not, learning how to read and write and just that education, that edge. Because I feel sorry for some of my brothers and sisters, they do not know how to read or write. I'm surprised that they've gotten ahead and have done so well without an education. But just having that education really gave me that edge. That's one reason why I wanted you guys to have an education and pushed you in that direction so that you can also have even more of an edge than what I did.Pascolita Morales: You mention your mom a lot. Do you think she was the biggest influence in your life?Maria Morales: She played a great part. But so did my dad. For that matter, so did my husband . You learn from a lot of people. You learn from everybody that's around you. From my dad, I learned how to work hard, how to have strong determination. My mom was independent, but he had strong determination to finish things and to do things very well. My mom, I had never met anybody like her. For the period that she was born, she was definitely not subservient. She was number one and everybody else was further on down the line. For my husband and I, I've been with him for such a long time. We've been married for 40 years. I learned more how to be truthful, how to listen, how to communicate, how to put yourself in another person's shoes to see how they feel. I guess that compassion and empathy. As you go along in life, you'll see that you never stop learning. You always can learn from somebody, somebody has something to offer. Those were the individuals that were the most influential.Pascolita Morales: I know you and dad met when you were pretty young, about 16 or so.Maria Morales: 16, correct. YeahPascolita Morales: What's one of your favorite memories that you and dad share?Maria Morales: I guess all the traveling that we did. We did a lot of traveling and especially camping that we did in Northern California, remote campgrounds where you king of have to just survive on your own as much as you possibly could. But we did a lot of traveling either in the truck or the motorcycle or now in the car, the '51 that he has. But we just did a lot of traveling. I think those are good memories that we have, as far as it is not like particular one. But just all the different trips that we took and the sharing of the stories.Pascolita Morales: Was it hard to transition from being with your big family and your mom, dad, over to --Maria Morales: Two.Pascolita Morales: To just two in whole different world?Maria Morales: It sure was. It was very hard. I remember when we first got married, I couldn't cook for two. I had to cook for 40. Making these elaborate meals for 40. And then, he ate them. Consequently, things happen and stuff that he was just so happy that he had real food and stuff. So it took me a while to adjust for the cooking at the store. We always used to be at work at four in the morning. He always slept in and I could for the life of me not sleep in, and four in the morning I was up the one-room apartment. Twiddling my thumbs and stuff. But so just that whole period of adjustment and stuff that was a lot. And I came from a very large family. And his was large, but it wasn't as large, and it was just two totally different upbringings. His upbringing was more middle-class, and mine was survival. It's just survival. There's no other way you can put it. [00:25:00] But we were happy.Pascolita Morales: Can you tell me about some of the most important lessons you've learned in life?Maria Morales: Important lessons. I would say again, listening was an important lesson to learn.You can hear somebody, but listening is different. Communicating in the sense that not just being able to -- with your tonation or speak clearly. More communicating in a sense that you take your time into what you telling someone else, so that you're not offending them. You have to understand, growing up is like, we didn't talk, we shouted. You've been there, when we get together with a family. Everybody just shouts at each other. When they would talk, they weren't very nice. They were pretty mean to each other, called each other names and there was a lot of cussing, a lot of hand movements, but that was growing up. That's how you grew up. So, especially getting into the business world, you couldn't do those kinds of things and getting into other people out of your little comfort zone. Learning how to communicate and communicate in the sense that you were taking into consideration other people's points of view and stuff. Not just you being overbearing. Those were hard lessons to learn, but you learn them. Trusting others. Those were just some of the difficult lessons.Pascolita Morales: Do you think others that maybe came from a similar upbringing as you have those same challenges? Going from one world growing up with large families in more rude behavior, just everyone -- the big thing to do is to make fun of each other, who can have the best -- just being really crude and then transitioning from that to being professional and trying to still be somebody in the workplace that can be trusted, that can be communicated. Do you think that's something that other people in your upbringing you share with them that same experience?Maria Morales: Well, I see a lot of people are still stuck in that same East L. A. Behavior and mentality and they don't move on. Consequently, they lose good jobs or they're not offered good jobs because they can't transition. It takes a really hard look to be able to recognize it. The one who helped me a lot with that was your dad and he's the one that would point it out. Then of course, later on when I started working in other employers have little discussions as that. But I think again, a lot of it had to do with survival. That's how you survive, by being a rude, loud and stare somebody down. That was it. But it's not necessarily the same in the real world. You kind of have to take a step back and look at the -- this even happened in school, when I was in grammar school going from public school to a Catholic school. The first couple of days, I had a couple of fights and it was because I didn't like the way I was being looked at. The nuns took me aside and said, ''no, we don't do this here.'' You want to come to school here, you're going to have to behave responsibly. Tell them to stop making fun of me. And they did. Sooner or later we got along. But it was just they didn't know me and I didn't know them. But I think people can make that transition if they're aware of it. But it's being aware of it that's the difficult part. And that's where the element of respect comes in.Pascolita Morales: What do you think you're proudest of in your life?Maria Morales: The proudest. My kids. Those are the ones I'm the proudest of. I think Joey has accomplished a lot going back to school the way you did and then finishing school with such high honors. Even though he had teenage kids of his own and another work schedule that he had. Amanda, Amanda's like grandma. But also being very professional about it and stuff also finishing school, schooling that she did. She's getting her master's. I think she's the first one in the family in our family, and especially in the Morales's that is getting their master's. So [00:30:00] that's a great accomplishment on her own. You did very well in grammar school and high school. Finished college in four years. All of you take not only the education part, but also you take care of your kids. You take really good care of your kids and they in turn, will take care of you later on. Dad has done very well for himself. His music, his songwriting has really improved. He has a lot of creativity in everything that he does and a lot of pride. So what am I proudest of is my family.Pascolita Morales: We're very thankful to you for being the glue that pushed us all to do greater things. Including Dad. Dad is probably our biggest success story. He's been through it all and he's seen it all, and I think you were the one that really helped him to see his role in life and his potential. By seeing you guys as strong as you were really helped us to know that as a unit, your decisions were going to be the right ones for all of us, whether we liked it or not. I think that you guys being so strong really helped us. So I think all of the stories and everything that you went through growing up gave you that foundation just to be that strong person, and go through so many things and come out smiling. It's pretty amazing.Maria Morales: Well, I think one of the things that even though we got married very young, one of the things that we both did was that I let him be him and he let me be me. We didn't try to mold each other into something that we weren't. By having that freedom and that independence, it helped us. It helped us to grow and actually kept us together, even though we were polarized at different points of our lives. But it did help us stay together, and at the same time, we wanted to provide a good foundation for you guys and that's why we stayed in the house that we're in. We've been there for 32 years. It's not a house, it's a home. That's the difference, to have a home, some place always to go back to and some place where we went through and we worked hard to provide for all of you and for the grandkids, but at the same time, it was very rewarding.Pascolita Morales: I'd like to go back to grandma and grandpa, can you tell me how they met?Maria Morales: Grandma and grandpa, how they met? Grandma was about, I think she was about 14 years old when they met. She was living in Guadalajara and he was already a sailor in the Mexican Navy. He was about 20 years old. They had met at Las Fiestas de Octubre, which is a big festival in Guadalajara. She had gotten permission with her sister, Gregoria, to go to the Fiestas and they met there. The first day she was there, they met. She had one brother. She didn't have a dad. She had a brother, Inocencio. I guess Inocencio was quite upset that he had seen my mom with my dad. Then to put, he was a sailor. He wasn't just a regular guy from the city, a sailor, a foreign sailor. So when she got home from the fiestas, he gave her a good beating for being seen with a man. So the next day when she met my dad again, she went ahead and told him what happened and he convinced her to go off with him and she agreed. The next day was Sunday. Sunday morning, they had sent her to go buy masa to make tortillas, and she went to the market and never returned. So she took off with him and --Pascolita Morales: She was 13 years old, right?Maria Morales: Fourteen years old.Pascolita Morales: Fourteen.FEMALE_1: Did she then come back to her family or maintain contact with them or was it like she was -- that was it, she just --Maria Morales: She left and she didn't come back for another maybe 10, 15 years later is when she came back. She left in 1922 and didn't go back until about 1933, '34.FEMALE_1: So do you remember your maternal grandmother?Maria Morales: No.FEMALE_1: Did you have contact with her?Maria Morales: I never met any of my grandparents.FEMALE_1: Okay.Maria Morales: So the time I came along, they were both deceased.FEMALE_1: Okay.Maria Morales: Yeah. But my dad had left home when he was really young too. He was about 12 years old when he left.Pascolita Morales: Did they come straight to the US after they got married?Maria Morales: No. From [00:35:00] Guadalajara, they went to Manzanillo, and then they went on a ship to Guaymas. Then Guaymas, took them about a month to get there. Then he abandoned the Navy, and then they went to Nogales, that is Sonora, and then they crossed into the United States at Nogales, Arizona. They paid, I think she said it was a nickel head tax, and they entered the country legally at that point.Pascolita Morales: You said it took a month for them to sail?Maria Morales: Right. Yeah, she was sicker than a dog. That's why she kept on telling, she never would like to get on boats because she was just so nauseous from being on that rocking boat and stuff.Pascolita Morales: So after they crossed at Nogales, what did they do from there?Maria Morales: From Nogales, they worked their way all the way up until they went up to Scottsdale. They worked there. They worked in Phoenix. They worked in Brawley and Calipatria, El Centro, by Indio, and then they came to Maravilla, down the street.Pascolita Morales: Wow.Maria Morales: Work here by Fisher and Dangler. Yeah.Pascolita Morales: Had they already had children at that point?Maria Morales: No.Pascolita Morales: That was before?Maria Morales: They didn't have any kids at all. They got here, I think it was in 1923, and then they left in 1924. My mom was already nine months pregnant with my brother, Tony. He was the first one and they were on their way to Fresno to go work. My dad was a big traveler. He was a big adventurer. He wouldn't sit still or stay still at any one specific place. So even though they were happy here, he moved. He wanted to go work some place else. They were on their way to Fresno and they didn't get there. They stopped in Tulare because she went into labor. They got off the road. He went to the first farmhouse they saw, he knocked on the door and told the lady that was there that his wife was in labor. She came in and they delivered the baby, and then they stayed for about three months there --Pascolita Morales: Wow.Maria Morales: -- until she was well enough to travel after. Now, when I go through the Grapevine, I'm always really tense driving, going up and down the hills. I can't even fathom being on a Model T car, going through that hill on the old road and being nine months pregnant, this just amazes me that they were able to do that.Pascolita Morales: So after, then that was your brother, Tony?Maria Morales: Tony, right. So he was born in Tulare. Then they moved towards all over Northern California and they even lived in Oakland for a while. She hated it there too because of the cold and then the dampness. Lupe was born in Fresno. Then I had a sister named Esperanza and she was born in Mojave. She passed away. Then I had another sister Esperanza, was born in Bakersfield. Then Lola was born in Los Angeles, that was in 1932. Then they went back to Mexico during the Depression. They weren't evicted out. They just went on their own, but they were more or less pressed to go. They weren't deported, but they were being repatriated and basically asked to go back home during the Depression and stuff. So they did. They went back to Mexico and it wasn't the same. Life was just not the same. It was even harder over there than over here. Then my brother, Johnny, was born in Hidalgo, in Jacala. And then Jesse was born in Zacatecas and Helen also was born in Zacatecas. Then they started coming back up north. Carmen was born in Culiacan in 1942, and then Michael was born in Tijuana in 1945, and then they crossed over in 1945. Angel was born right there in Maravilla, but near Soledad church in 1947 and then Emmanuel and I were born on Dozier. Emmanuel in '49 and I was born in 1951.Pascolita Morales: Wow.Maria Morales: Yeah.Maria Morales: Poor grandma.Pascolita Morales: I know. I think that's one reason why she bought the house in Maravilla and in Dozier because she needed an anchor. She needed some place to stay permanent. She was tired of traveling from city to city with all these kids and not having a home.Pascolita Morales: Kind of like you?Maria Morales: Yeah. She really wanted to have a home and she picked to me the best place to have a home. Yeah, there was gangs and killings, this and that, but they didn't bother us. I think it was anybody [00:40:00] else who came into the area. We lived really close to the projects, but we didn't associate with any of the gangs from the projects, not that kind of a thing and stuff, and we just felt very secure.Pascolita Morales: Very nice. One last thing. How would you like to be remembered?Maria Morales: Well, I think that I was helpful. I think if anything, that's one thing that I learned. I learned to be helpful and to be helpful to whoever needs help. That I was very loving and caring for my family, not only my own immediate family, but my brothers and sisters and my nephews and nieces and anybody in my friends, my in-laws, stuff. That I kept my word if I ever said I was going to do something, I did it. That I was very hard working, my God, I worked a lot, from three until just last year. It just seemed like it was always working. I don't know. Make the best chocolate chip cookies, I don't know.Pascolita Morales: Yes, you do.Maria Morales: Tamales? Just that I was a good person. That's how I want to be remembered.Pascolita Morales: Very nice.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
MBY006219,"MALE_1:	[00:00:00] Hello. My name is [inaudible 00:00:05] Briones, I'm 16 years old. It's February 20th, 2010. I'm at the South Los Angeles Library, and I'm here today with my brother.Hoseas Makova:	Hello. My name's Eliseo Hoseas Monkova. I am 20. It's February 20th, 2010. My location is South Los Angeles and I'm with my bro. How was your day today?MALE_1:	It was good. I didn't think that this was going to go this way but I'm happy it did. I'm happy that you're here.Hoseas Makova:	Me too. Ready for today?MALE_1:	Yeah. I was thinking some questions that I had for you, what was your first memory of me?Hoseas Makova:	My first memory of you? I don't really know exactly when this was but I just remember we were with mom and your dad, and we had fireworks. I remember I had gotten one and I popped, then you just started running, you took off around the block. That was really funny.MALE_1:	That's cool.Hoseas Makova:	I was just laughing because you were like a scareddy cat, ""ahh!"" running away.MALE_1:	I don't remember that.Hoseas Makova:	What's your first memory of me?MALE_1:	Actually that old car that mom used to have, the blue one.Hoseas Makova:	The one with no window, right?MALE_1:	Yeah. We're tumbling around in the back seat for a basketball, and I remember you toss it at my head and then you flicked me off and then we just started laughing. We were really little.Hoseas Makova:	I was a pretty corrupted youth.MALE_1:	It was fun.Hoseas Makova:	Pretty stuffy in here. Do you regret anything in your life? Do you have any regrets?MALE_1:	Maybe not looking for more programs and different things to do while I was in middle school, getting started earlier, like to do different internships and things like that, that would have helped me out later.Hoseas Makova:	All right, it's cool.MALE_1:	What about you?Hoseas Makova:	Not really. I wouldn't be the person I am today. That's why we do things and makes us who we are today. How did you even get into Reggae?MALE_1:	I don't know. I think around 13 years old, 14 years old, I found myself calming down, I don't know.Hoseas Makova:	I remember you used to listesn to Slipknot just banging your head, moving your head around and stuff, because you had long hair back then.MALE_1:	I just started calming down. I realized that there is other things that interested me, like social issues and things like that. I wasn't so much about just blind rebellion anymore.Hoseas Makova:	I think you were depressed for awhile, because you're not going to just adolescence for a while because I remember you were just angry at everybody, you hated everybody, I don't know why? Then all of a sudden you're like peace and love man, peace and love, then into Reggae and all that.MALE_1:	Yeah, I guess I just started finding myself. I was angry at everybody, I was just trying to rebel. It was just blind rebellion. I didn't know what I was mad at exactly.Hoseas Makova:	You were just mad at different things, I guess where we were at and stuff. I could imagine we could have a lot better since our situations and stuff.MALE_1:	It is cool though. I liked the switch...Hoseas Makova:	When I moved in?MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. It was pretty chilled, we had a lot of fun. At the beginning it was hard because I didn't know anybody in your family. It was pretty weird.MALE_1:	That's true, I remember when you first moved down with us.Hoseas Makova:	You didn't like me.MALE_1:	I was pretty much an only child up until 13 and then out of nowhere I got a little sister, and then you moved in with us. It wasn't always spoiled or anything, I just wasn't used to it.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	I guess as time went by, we grew a lot closer and I found a brother in you. That was really cool.Hoseas Makova:	I always was a brother, you knew that I was there. I was pretty far away. I was near Mexicali. That's pretty far.MALE_1:	Yeah. How was it like living with me? How was it like getting a little brother there?Hoseas Makova:	You were always my brother and I always had Lorenzo too my other brother. It was [00:05:00] obviously different because I lived in a house and you moved into an apartment. It was really crowded and everybody was always in my business. There was no privacy there, I wasn't really used to that.MALE_1:	I guess I was used to it?Hoseas Makova:	I got accustomed to it though. I adapt pretty quickly because I move around from place to place. I was just like, well, get used to it.MALE_1:	I feel you. What was it like being around mom always?Hoseas Makova:	Our mom? At first she was cool. She was chilled. She let me do what I wanted, I had a lot of freedom compared to being with my dad, I could say he kept locked up and stuff. It was cool at first but then I don't know what happened man. Things change.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	What do you think your life would be in 10 years?MALE_1:	I can tell you what I hope it will be. In 10 years I'll be 26, so maybe I at least have a Bachelor's in Psychology, some decent job. Starting a life with Rachel.Hoseas Makova:	Rachel? Are you sure she's the one dude?MALE_1:	I feel it. It's been like three years now.Hoseas Makova:	You guys have a lot to experience. That's your first partner. I think it's really your first girlfriend and first relationship just because we never knew any of the other ones. We met her, so I think that's your first girlfriend, like real relationship.MALE_1:	It's the first one I brought home.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	To some extent I introduced her to mom, I introduced her to you, I brought her to everybody. Everyone knows about her. I think it was for that reason, because I felt like this is somebody that's really cool, maybe not like me, but that I can identify with in some way, and she's done a lot for me. She's helped me get through a lot of the problems, a lot of the issues from when I was younger, like stuff with mom. She's helped me deal with my stuff with my dad.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	He left us at an early age. I think that's something that I was really angry at and she helped me deal with that anger. That's why I feel like we're really close and we want to take it that far.Hoseas Makova:	I think you guys are young, you guys had problems and you guys helped each other with that. But I think, as individuals, you guys are not really meant for each other. You guys are cool at each other stuff, but you've got a lot of differences, a lot. But you guys can always work around that.MALE_1:	I think our differences have helped a lot in the relationship somehow. They've caused their problems, especially because our different backgrounds, like she was brought up in very wealthy home and we weren't.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	She hasn't let that get in the way of anything.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	She's always tried to help me. I've been a little, not negligent, but I haven't wanted to accept it.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Accept the hope, and I'm getting to a point where I'm getting better at it. I'm just learning a lot of things from her.Hoseas Makova:	It's a lot of work but it teaches you things about yourself, like your limits and other stuff. Me and J.J, I don't know. J.J is one big mess.MALE_1:	She's helped you a lot though.Hoseas Makova:	She has. We've done a lot of stuff together, but I don't know dude, I think I'm young. I think I have different goals for myself and she wants to go somewhere else.MALE_1:	Yeah. That's one thing I've noticed about you and her. She's helped you grow up a lot.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, responsibility-wise.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	That's why, she's been pushing me like, ""Come on do this, do that."" I'm like, ""No.""MALE_1:	Does Sunny get to you though?Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	What's it like, now, moving back with your grandparents?Hoseas Makova:	It's cool. I feel like I'm on my own just because everybody is doing their own thing, so I got to depend on myself. But I think that's cool because it pushes me to move on forward, to make a better person of myself. I guess basically more money. I'm trying to get more money, go back to school and [00:10:00] maybe get a career. I don't know about a career, but a business. Business sounds cooler.MALE_1:	I get you.Hoseas Makova:	I don't like working for other people, I like working for myself.MALE_1:	That's cool.MALE_2:	Do you have an idea of what kind of business you'd be interested in?Hoseas Makova:	Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm still looking around what really interests me. I always loved planting, like agriculture and stuff. I guess I might look something into there.MALE_1:	I just wanted to say thank you for still keeping our relationship showing even though you moved back over there?Hoseas Makova:	Dude, you are my bro, and you're always going to be my bro. I think, if anything, we just stick together because we have friends and stuff but they're doing their own thing. We got to stick together as a family.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	I try to keep it together. I might not have like talked to you for a while, but I'll send you a text here and there.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	Saying what's up?MALE_1:	I think that's really cool. That means a lot to me because I know you're busy, I know you're working.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Trying to support yourself and stuff, and it means a lot that you still check in, take care of me in a way.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, I will talk to you actually, it's not all phone. I don't want to go over there with that.MALE_2:	So I'm just curious. I don't know your story, did you guys live together when you were little or what is it timeline?Hoseas Makova:	Oh, well, I'm 20, he's 16 okay, but her mom and dad, they were together. I don't know how long, maybe like a year or so.MALE_1:	They were together for a year, but they only recently got divorced.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. Obviously they're not divorced yet. They're sort of divorced, technically like married. I mean technically married together. But they did separate like around when I was one and then our mom started dating your dad.MALE_1:	Yeah, and you still came over every once in a while.Hoseas Makova:	Actually, I lived with mom and your dad for a while. I remember when I thought he was my dad at first. I don't know because when I saw my dad, he's dark. My dad's black and I was like, what the heck? I'm not black. I thought your dad was my dad. But then I grew up to realize that that's not true. But then certain problems happened where my dad came in and took me while, I don't know how old I was, I was like three, three or so, or two. I started living my dad for pretty much like the rest of my life until I was in eighth grade.MALE_1:	Then you came back to live with your grandparents for a while, right?Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. Actually, I lived with my grandparents and then we moved with my other brother to mom. Her name is Cheryl in Fontana, and then I don't know. They had a kid, my brother Lorenzo. Then things happened. They fought a lot. So then I moved back with my grandparents and my brother Lorenzo and his mom went to I think Orange County where they were there with their parents. Then in the fourth grade, I moved to Imperial Valley. You know where it's at, right?MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	All right. It's 20 miles from Mexicali. It's pretty far, past Palm Springs. Then, my dad moved in with another lady named Mona. Then problems happened again, so we move back with my grandparents in La Puente. Then yeah, I went to La Puente for eighth grade. That was eighth grade through my junior year. Then I was missing her pretty bad so then I moved with my mom to Fairfax High.MALE_1:	Yeah, that's when you came and lived with us, huh?Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, I started living with you. So I didn't see you. I mean, I visited you once in a while.MALE_1:	You came only to stay for a weekend every once in a great while.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. I remember that. Whenever I came over and you had Pokemon cards, holographics and stuff. That was so good. Pokemon cards.MALE_1:	Yeah, it was cool. Even though we we're four years apart, we still had those things together playing video games and stuff. We shared that whenever you came over.Hoseas Makova:	I know you hated video games but you got into it now. It's because I always forced you to play with me.MALE_1:	It's fun though. It's something that we've shared.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, it's cool. I mean, you're becoming like a small-time poet here. You're doing poetry, it's pretty cool.MALE_1:	I [00:15:00] don't know, it's been a passion. Just something that I've been into, something that has helped me express myself get out a lot of the stuff that I had inside. Then at first, I didn't think I was any good, it was more or less just to get out all the feelings that I had that I had been holding back. Then I think later on, people started telling me that I was pretty good and I started getting more into it, then I lost it for a while, I didn't write. With you thinking that there was this Peace Jam conference, the one where we met the Nobel Peace Prize winners. There's a little workshop, a poetry workshop, I was in there and they just started spitting. I just felt so happy and so just elated by what they were saying, by their rhymes, by the whole process of it. What happened to me? Why did I lose it? I just started writing again. I started writing again and I started getting better. I started not only just writing whatever I felt, but I started trying to think-Hoseas Makova:	Creatively. Yeah. Different things you got there.MALE_1:	I started taking it not just what I felt, but what I felt about something. What I feel about social issues, about my own experiences in school, things like that. Actually right now, the open mic, that's tomorrow, that's actually being held by the people that did the workshop.Hoseas Makova:	Awesome. So that's cool.MALE_1:	Their whole little headquarters is two blocks from the house.Hoseas Makova:	So then they might recognize you and stuff, you can go there.MALE_1:	Yeah. No, I am going there.Hoseas Makova:	That little place with a music place, right? Where they record stuff?MALE_1:	No. It's across the street from the 76th, by the free way. Remember that building that we never knew what it was for, it was just there?Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. It was like grass on the side of the free way. Yeah, I know what you're talking about.MALE_1:	It's right there. I just walk there. They have workshops on Tuesdays and you just go there and you feel like just this amazing vibe. It's peaceful, it's nice, and they just create a space where you can talk. Where you can talk to people. Where you can feel safe and feel there's not the pressures of the outside world there. They focus on writing and they actually have a studio and they make CDs and things. So it's perfect and it's right there.Hoseas Makova:	Honestly, I think you're beginning to sound like Latinos.MALE_1:	I don't know. I mean, it's maybe not-Hoseas Makova:	Like ""Hey foo, what's up foo, we down?""MALE_1:	How can I put it? I wouldn't characterize that as a Latino.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, it's stereotyping.MALE_1:	Yeah, exactly. I think there's just certain slangs that are in our hood.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. I mean, it actually depends where you go to. Because you go to East LA that's how they talk. That's Latino to them. But if you go, I don't know.MALE_1:	Glendale?Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. Latino is a whole different thing. It's more Armenian though there. So I guess the culture difference where you're around and I guess what you're experienced to.MALE_1:	Yeah. I mean, slang is regional. I feel like slang is regional.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, definitely.MALE_1:	It's just what part of LA you're from, what part of LA you're in. There's the scene. Whatever people you're with, you absorb the words they use.Hoseas Makova:	I mean, you could be Latino and listen to rancheras when we're younger. You can be Latino are not like rancheras.MALE_1:	I wouldn't characterize being Latino as any certain you have to fit here, here, and here stereotype, I guess.Hoseas Makova:	Or any race in that, generally. I think race has nothing to do with who you are anymore, it's what you were brought up around. Because you could be Asian and be like her. Like April, you know how they are, so yeah.MALE_1:	The way I see it. There's always going to be something in your home, that's your base. It's wherever you grew up, your home.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, I get you.MALE_1:	That's where it all starts. That's where you start getting all that knowledge and you start picking up all those words. Then you start going to school and then you get that side of it. Then that's where you start building who you are and who you identify yourself as. It's constantly changing, like you said, I used to listen to rock, I used to listen to metal and all of that. I was all into that. Then it just changed, and I guess I changed. I guess what I'm getting at is [00:20:00] it just all depends on what you're around, and what you absorb, and what you like and what you don't like of it. Because I'm Latino. I listen to reggae. I listen to--Hoseas Makova:	Reggaeton, that's cool.MALE_1:	Yeah, I mean, I like some of it. Then I listen to techno.Hoseas Makova:	That's what's in now. Everybody's into techno, Raving and rave kids, Kandi bracelets, all that. I like techno but not that much. Techno is just too fast beat.MALE_1:	You know what I've always had a passion for is the bass in it. It's just the bass in the music.Hoseas Makova:	The bass is awesome.MALE_1:	That's what I like. The bass in the music and so it's different. It's different on every person. I think sometimes because of the pressures of your community or your outside world, you might like some things and then not tell them.Hoseas Makova:	What do you mean?MALE_1:	You say some of the people at your work, they're trollers or whatever. Maybe they like certain other types of music, they just don't share that with them.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, they do. There's one guy he listens to Transplants, I don't know if you know who they are.MALE_1:	No.Hoseas Makova:	It's Travis Barker, somebody from The Used. It's a bunch of different people from different bands, they make one band. They've got pretty cool music. He likes [inaudible 00:21:22] , but whenever like he bumps, he bumps like Cholo rap, west side and stuff.MALE_1:	He just doesn't necessarily share it with that community, but he does like it. Maybe that's because of pressure. Maybe it's because he just doesn't feel like it.Hoseas Makova:	That's just part of who he is. That is, I like this, who listens to that?MALE_1:	Exactly. That's cool. I like that. We don't have to stay into what are our little category is.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. I find it to be so closed minded just to be like, ""Yeah. I'm Puerto Rican. I've been Puerto Rican for like all the way."" That's stupid, because there's not just Puerto Ricans in this world, there's different colors.MALE_1:	I dig.Hoseas Makova:	I mean, there will be a lot of other things that you like, but if you just stick to that, you're not going to find out.MALE_1:	But it's weird because, I mean, I'm not saying everyone has to think like that, but it's crazy how much some people care. I've heard people, because Rachel is Nigerian, she's black or what have you African-American. I've had people actually come up to me and tell me that me being in an interracial relationship is wrong. It's wrong. It's mainly the older people that would do that or people just stare at us like we're an oddity.Hoseas Makova:	A relationship plays a lot of role in that too. My grandparent, he's a pastor, he thinks it's wrong for girls to wear pants. What's up with that? ""They should wear skirts. They shouldn't wear pants. Pants are for men,"" they say. That's so stupid. ""You shouldn't be in the kitchen, kitchen's for women.""MALE_1:	Wow.Hoseas Makova:	I mean, they're really old that's why and they just brought up around that era.MALE_2:	All right, I'm curious. How does that make you feel when somebody just said to you?MALE_1:	Oh, we've sort of become used to it. The relationship has gone on for about three years now. So we've dealt with the whole like people snickering. Snickering and staring is like mainly amongst the younger people. Older people are actually more bold and they'll say something to us or they'll look at us really dirty, really mean. We just try to brush it off, keep going with ourselves, with each other. That's what it's about.Hoseas Makova:	Love. Powerful.MALE_1:	Yeah.MALE_2:	How did you meet your girlfriend?MALE_1:	We were in middle school. We went to the same middle school. Like we're two completely different people in the sense that like we were brought up differently. She was brought up in a really wealthy home. She's, I guess, somewhat spoiled and me, I was more used to, you get through life like with what you have and you just keep moving forward. I don't know. I went through a lot of struggles. Me and my mother, I mean, we've been on the streets before. We've not had a house and her, she's living in a home all her life. Her parents own like several buildings and cab companies. They just have a lot. So [00:25:00] at first, that was something that we had to get through and I don't know, we just did. We got through it, we got through those differences and we just try to continue to enjoy each other. What about you and Adrienne, man?Hoseas Makova:	Me and Adrienne?MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	What about me and her like how we met?MALE_1:	Yeah.Speaker 1:	MySpace. So lame. MySpace. It's like MySpace was the Number One hook up spot. You know what I mean? Just go around looking for girls and stuff. But now like, I mean I met her on MySpace. But like, I don't know, I didn't like her at first. She just seemed too conceited. I was like whatever bitch and then I don't know. We just started talking more and more and we realized we have a lot in common. Then one day we just agreed to meet each other and we met and from that day on, we just really liked each other. Yeah. Since, we've been together almost two years, almost, but I don't know. I think it's just coming to an end. It's just we're growing up.MALE_1:	I dig.Hoseas Makova:	Going down different paths.MALE_2:	I mean you touched on the fact that you had so many struggles in your life. I'm curious about, if you'd like to share a little bit about when you were on the streets. Like what it was like.MALE_1:	I've always been with my mom and like my mom has had I guess several boyfriends. But I never really grew up with a father to say, and I don't know. It was just, I always looked at my mom and I was like that pillar of strength, I guess. She kept us going. We kept each other going and we use each other for strength. I remember we lived in a car for a while and we were parked out of my favorite taco spot, Chabelitas. We were parked across the street. We were there for like maybe one to two weeks.Hoseas Makova:	What? For real? I didn't know that.MALE_1:	Yeah. I don't know. I slept in the back seat, I was the smallest one.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	But I slept in the backseat and I got all that space and it was just like, I guess the way like she was still trying to give me the best that she could.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Yeah. She was still trying to keep me comfortable. She slept in the front seat, like sitting up.Hoseas Makova:	She couldn't lean back?MALE_1:	Well, she could. But not too much.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Then we live there for a while, man and I mean now we live only what? Like ten blocks away from there?Hoseas Makova:	Not even like five blocks.MALE_1:	Yes. So just things like that. Like I don't know, it was weird because there was actually roaches in that car. That was pretty gross. But me at that time, I was thinking just like, ""Okay, it's just like home. ""Hoseas Makova:	I know. You get used to it.MALE_1:	Yeah. It's like there was roaches at the house anyway, so, I don't know. Then we lived outside for a while. That wasn't cool. I don't know. It was just hard.Hoseas Makova:	Lived outside where?MALE_1:	Like in the streets.Hoseas Makova:	Like living in the streets like homeless homeless?MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	Damn.MALE_1:	It wasn't that long. It was just like transition periods.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Trying to find like some family member that might help us out.Hoseas Makova:	Oh, like Mariam or something?MALE_1:	No. Tio Manuel.Hoseas Makova:	Tio Manuel?MALE_1:	Tio Manuel helped us out for a bit but he for a period, he did turn mom away and that's why we were like out there like that.Hoseas Makova:	Why?MALE_1:	I don't know, dude.Hoseas Makova:	Now like he's coming to us, to mom.MALE_1:	But I mean, it's not like he didn't help us out at all.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	He did help us out. We did stay with him for a while and it wasn't the first time that mom had lived with him.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	She was out because of problems with her mom. She was out before and I think that was a big part of it. That wasn't her first time living in the street.Hoseas Makova:	So she was used to it but she was like sad because of you.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Exactly. What she tried to do is just keep us going, keep me going. Making sure that I had something like, I remember we'd go like McDonald's or something. She'd get me a chicken and she wouldn't eat. She would just give it to me and she wouldn't eat anything. I didn't realize it back then.Hoseas Makova:	That's a lot.MALE_1:	Yeah. Exactly. Like I didn't realize it back then at that moment. Like I would just eat because I was hungry. But [00:30:00] she was giving up a lot right there. She was giving up a meal and I don't know. It's not that I took it for granted, but I didn't realize how much it was back then. I see it now and I think that's why no matter what happens, I still have a lot of love for her.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Because we've been through a lot of stuff together.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. Like she's your mom, dude. Like she's been there for you like since day one.MALE_1:	Yeah. It was hard doing. So actually, with my dad.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	He was an idiot.Hoseas Makova:	No, he's just going on the wrong path there. It happens.MALE_1:	Yeah.MALE_2:	So what are those experiences in knowing that your mother was that strong, what has that taught you?MALE_1:	Not to give up and no matter how bad things are, if you let that get to you and if you let it affect you, if you just stay stuck there, then you're going to be stuck there.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	You got to keep moving forward, man. That's the main thing I've learned from mom. It's you got to keep moving forward.Hoseas Makova:	Don't look back, yeah.MALE_1:	Yeah. Don't let anything or anybody stop you. You got to keep going through life because if you don't, then you're going to be stuck wherever you are. If you're in a bad spot, then you're going to be screwed.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. Let's move on. Yeah.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	I remember with mom too, we were younger, I think you were born already, I think. I'm not sure, depending with you probably. We used to go around selling elotes and stuff like candies. I think as a child I didn't realize it either. I just thought, ""Oh cool, my mom's selling candies and corn, that's awesome. You're the best mom ever."" I used to tell her all the time, but yeah, we we're really poor then.MALE_2:	Did your mom own her own car? You know how that works?Hoseas Makova:	No. She actually had a shopping car with a cooler in it and corn and stuff, and I don't know -- I think they're called ""chamoyadas"" like a packet of it and we used to sell that around everywhere.MALE_2:	Where? Do you remember the route where she would go?Hoseas Makova:	No. It was a park. I remember a park we'd sit down there.MALE_2:	What would you do?Hoseas Makova:	Just walk around with her eating corn and candy? Yeah. Having fun in the park.MALE_1:	She came up, though. I don't know. I remember when she first started going to school. She went to LACC.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	She would take me to class with her.Hoseas Makova:	Oh yeah. I remember. Yeah there was no baby-sitter.MALE_1:	Because there was no baby-sitter. So she'd take me to class with her and after a while her teacher started asking for me, in her classes when I wouldn't be there sometimes. She would leave me with the neighbors or something. When it was something important, like a test or something.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	I couldn't be in there. It was cool though because I learned a lot in those classes. Just sitting there, I didn't understand some of the words they were saying, but I understood some of the concepts.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	I remember this one class she had, I think it was African-American studies or something like that. I used to laugh because the teacher was really animated. She was really lively. I remember one thing was when the slaves would run or something like that, she would say, ""Renegade, renegade, renegade, renegade."" She would keep doing that and I would laugh. Now that I'm older, I see what she meant by it and what she was trying to illustrate. I learned a lot in those classes.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	I guess some of her classmates liked me. My first birthday party, my first actual party was thrown by one of her classmates at their house. Yeah. It's funny because I didn't know it was my party, till halfway through it.Hoseas Makova:	You were just partying, yeah.MALE_1:	I was at a birthday party. I was having fun. I hadn't been to that many and I just had a birthday partying and then I'm asking some little girl, I just asked her, ""Yo, whose party is this?"" She's like, ""It's yours."" I was like, ""What?"" I ran to mom and I asked her, ""This is my party?"" She's like, ""Yeah."" I was just so excited. It was one of the happiest moments of my life.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	My first birthday party. I look at a table and I see presents and I got a bike. That's when I gotHoseas Makova:	That BMX bike?MALE_1:	Yeah. That's when I got that bike. I learnt to ride it four years later, five years later.Hoseas Makova:	It's like six months ago. Yeah.MALE_1:	But I got that bike. I was just so happy. I didn't know it was my party till halfway through the thing. [00:35:00] It was a cool experience and a bunch of her classmates were there. She had this study group and they all got together and threw that party for me. That was dope.Hoseas Makova:	That's cool. Yeah, you were always more mature than your age was. You was like an obedient kid. I know any other kid would be running, screaming, ""Oh I'm bored. Let me go, let me go.""MALE_1:	I think it came from that those experiences.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Where we just had to.Hoseas Makova:	Because you saw a lot.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	You saw and experienced a lot. You knew what was up.MALE_1:	Exactly. That was it. I knew what was up. I knew that there was stuff I had to get done.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	If I wasn't helping, I was in the way. So I tried not to be in the way.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah, you tried to be like, ""All right Mom, do your stuff.""MALE_1:	I was like, ""All right, I'll be cool."".Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. That's cool man.MALE_1:	What about for you? How was childhood for you?Hoseas Makova:	My childhood for me? I don't know honestly. It was just a lot of stuff. Just moving around a lot. That was hard. That was really hard. Just because I get a group of friends and we cool and I got to move. I get another group of friends and I got to move again and it's like damn.MALE_1:	Yeah.Hoseas Makova:	I think that was the hardest part for me. I was always used to my dad yelling, my step mom yelling and stuff. I was pretty much used to that. Just changing friends, having to adapt against all the different environment and that was pretty hard.MALE_1:	I feel you. I went to five different elementary schools.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Five different elementary schools.Hoseas Makova:	I was at La Puente in Erwin for my first grade then I went to Date Elementary in Fontana. Then I went to Erwin again, La Puente. Then I went to Hidalgo in Imperial Valley. Then I went to Westmoreland for my junior high. Then I went to Torch Middle School in La Puente then I went to Bassett in La Puente. Then I went to Fairfax. So, yeah. To a continuation [inaudible 00:37:11]. Say nine different schools. No, nine times I moved to a different school.MALE_1:	[inaudible 00:37:18] from elementary school then I started getting some solidarity once I went to middle school.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	That is three years is the longest I've been at at any school.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah me too. Three Years.MALE_1:	Yeah you're right. It sucks to move around so much.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Be the new kid all the time.Hoseas Makova:	Yeah. You get used to it though. I was like, ""Hi everybody. Nice to meet you.""MALE_1:	I don't know, I guess what I learned from that not to I didn't get too attached to anybody at first. That's what changed in middle school. I started getting attached to people like Triston. He's still my boy.Hoseas Makova:	Triston's been your homie since forever now for sure.MALE_1:	Yeah. He's been my homie since the sixth grade.

I'm her granddaughter and her name is?Perfecta Contreras:	Perfecta Contreras.Magdalena de la Vigil:	She is how old today?Perfecta Contreras:	How old I am today?Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yes.Perfecta Contreras:	I am 82 years old.Magdalena de la Vigil:	The date today is? February.Perfecta Contreras:	February, 22nd.Magdalena de la Vigil:	And we are in what city?Perfecta Contreras:	Los Angeles.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yes. What part of Los Angeles?Perfecta Contreras:	East Los Angeles.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yes. Today, I wanted to bring you here today because you're very special in my life and you taught me so much and you're the rock of our family. I want to ask you a lot of questions because your stories are always been inspirational to me, and beautiful. You've told me stories at certain parts of my life that were perfectly at that point of my life, there it is. It's just the right time to tell me a story because I was going through some growing pain and then the story came to me from your life and it helped me reflect, and grow, and make correct decisions. So I thought I have to have her come today. I want to start 'buelita because that's what I call you. I don't call you grandmother. I call you abuelita, in Spanish and even shorter, 'buelita because that's what we first said when we were little.Perfecta Contreras:	Yes.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I wanted to have you talk about first, where you were born. If you don't mind telling us where you were born?Perfecta Contreras:	I was born in San Antonio, Texas.Magdalena de la Vigil:	What year?Perfecta Contreras:	April 18, 1927.Magdalena de la Vigil:	1927?Perfecta Contreras:	1927. April 18, 1927.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You were in San Antonio, Texas?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. Then after three years, I was three years old when my parents left the United States and went to Mexico. It was very, very hard for my mother because she was only 18 years old with me, and in May, my sister born and my father's family, they was too mean to my mother and she have to leave.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Why did they go back to Mexico? They were in Texas, but why did they move back?Perfecta Contreras:	Well, the president of the United States gave a chance to the people that was living here. That was when they put the frontier and when they started searching and things like that and president says to my mother-- to my parents that they can leave to Mexico if they want to. They can stay in the United States and make papers so they can go and come back and things like that. But my father family decides to stay in Mexico and they took my mother. My mother's side family stayed in Texas, San Antonio, Texas always.Magdalena de la Vigil:	So the border was open at that point and allowed people to move back and forth?Perfecta Contreras:	Not to move back and forth, but they allowed to visit Mexico and come back. The people that stay in the United States, they have to get documents so they can go to Mexico and come back.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Okay.Perfecta Contreras:	The people they wanted to stay in Mexico, they take all their belongings and stay in Mexico. That was my father's family.Magdalena de la Vigil:	So they had to make a decision of where they wanted to stay at that point?Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah.Magdalena de la Vigil:	So before that, they were allowed to go back and forth?Perfecta Contreras:	No.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Okay.Perfecta Contreras:	No. Yes. I mean, they was free. They was free.Magdalena de la Vigil:	They-- and then all of a sudden, the president said that you need to decide?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Interesting, I didn't know that. That's new. So then they decided to go to Mexico. What part of Mexico did you move to?Perfecta Contreras:	Close to Monterrey, Mexico. It was a farm, a rancho and that was very hard for my mother like I said before, and I cannot go in all of the details because it's a big story. But my mother have to leave from that ranch and come back to Laredo, Mexico, not the United States yet. But she came close to the Laredo, Texas and stay in Laredo, Mexico. We stay there, and it was the Depression times and my mother have very difficult to racists because they only paid $0.50 for a whole day of work on those days, and my mother don't have enough to feed us. They used to give her a plate of stuff to eat to her and then she gave it to us, to me and my sister. In the night, she gave us a little cookie with a little a bit of soda and that was it for the day. That was very hard times for my mother.Magdalena de la Vigil:	That's when she was in Laredo? When she left your father because when she left the ranch, there was problems and she had to leave, and then she took you guys with her.Perfecta Contreras:	Yes.Magdalena de la Vigil:	That's when it was the Depression, at that point when she left. So you were only living with your mom and your sister, and you had left your father from the ranch during the Depression?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes.Magdalena de la Vigil:	That's when you were living with her. But at one point you got separated from her.Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. Well, my father was looking for us. After about three years or something, two or three years, he find my mother in Laredo, Mexico, and he told my mother to go back with him, that he was going to get together again, and things like that, and it wasn't that-- I don't want to go with my father because I don't know my father, but my sister wanted to go and my mother went to Monterrey, Mexico with us. Then when we got there, they, I don't know how to say this. They tell my mother to leave.Magdalena de la Vigil:	The family?Perfecta Contreras:	Leave us there, and my mother don't have any choice because the lawyer was my father parents and they were on my father's side.Magdalena de la Vigil:	So the law was on your father's, your grandparents side?Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah. My uncles.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You said that, was it a police or someone came and made her leave?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. They told her to leave or they were going to disappear her if she don't leave. So she have to leave and leave us.Magdalena de la Vigil:	They threatened her?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. They threatened her.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Do you have memory of saying goodbye to her? Do you remember?Perfecta Contreras:	It's a long story, but they  took us to a house that belongs to one of my aunts and they lie to us that my mother was going to come there and they left. My father left us there with that aunt and that was it. We didn't see my mother no more.Interviewer:	That was the last time you saw your mother? You never saw her again?Perfecta Contreras:	No. I saw her again, but years after.Interviewer:	How much longer after?Perfecta Contreras:	Five years after, my mother show up again and my uncle, who was a police, he came and tell her to leave because my father wasn't there. My father went to Texas to work and he told my uncle to take care of us, and if my mother comes to chase her away again. So my father scared us, because he told us if we leave with my mother, the mochos, I don't know what the mochos mean in those days, he was going to give us to the mochos. I don't know what the mochos was.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Like monsters in a way?Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Someone like orphanage or something like that? You don't know?Perfecta Contreras:	I don't know. I didn't even have an idea but I was very scared. So I don't want to leave with my mother five years after.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You know what's funny 'buelita, that story you told me when I was young. I may have been upset with my parents or something, and I hear this story and my heart just fell apart just hearing your struggles and they were completely worse than what I've gone through, and that's why I remember you telling me that story and just thinking, ""Wow, my life's good"", when I heard that. You struggle not being with your mother, and then this is what was amazing about you. You were separated from your mother, but then you found, I don't want to say salvation, but you found a way to survive it. You were resilient and you were able to survive it when you lived on the ranch with your father, with the stories of you going into nature. I would like you to talk about that a little too. About how you had to work on the ranch and then the animals and things that brought you comfort now that you were away from your mother and just with your father, and your father remarried. So you had a new stepmother that wasn't very kind at that time too.Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah.Magdalena de la Vigil:	How was it on the ranch now that you didn't have your mom?Perfecta Contreras:	My father. I used to go to the forest, and pray that my mother come back. I prayed to La Virgen and in my imagination I think she'd show up and she did this to me.Magdalena de la Vigil:	She called to you?Perfecta Contreras:	I used to play with the animals in the forest, and it was this snake.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	I was going to school and very sad all the time. So I see this black snake crossing the little road where I was walking and it went into a tree, then it was laying down. I got in the tree because I know they were dangerous and I started touching her in the top part like that. She stays there, she don't move.Magdalena de la Vigil:	The snake.Perfecta Contreras:	For a little bit and then I left to school. The next morning I went to school, the snake was there again and I did the same thing. I was sobándola, I don't know how you say that in English.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Rubbing her.Perfecta Contreras:	Rubbing her.Magdalena de la Vigil:	The snake.Perfecta Contreras:	It stays there it doesn't move. I plan the way to be happy at school because that school I was there better to read. I don't want to say is more but I was there better to read.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You did well.Perfecta Contreras:	Mathematics and they pick me up when they have shows I sing.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Oh, they would pick you out to do the talent and all that?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. I still remember the real song they make me.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Can you sing it right now part of it? You know how to sing. I love your voice that's why.Perfecta Contreras:	In English, I can't.Magdalena de la Vigil:	No, but in Spanish.Perfecta Contreras:	""Yo soy la clave que tengo un moño y que no me estorba para cantar..."" something like.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I love it. I love it.Perfecta Contreras:	So in the end, I enjoyed like that and then I pick up my friends at school then I tried to enjoy it. But the sad part was one day was mother's day. They put us all in a carreta. I don't know how you call it here with some bulls.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Like a wagon.Perfecta Contreras:	A carreta.Magdalena de la Vigil:	A cart, like a cart.Perfecta Contreras:	The two bulls pull it. They put flowers all over and we go to the houses to sing for the mothers. I don't have any mother and I don't like my stepmother because she was too mean to us. So I never sing to her and I was crying all the time like that. I have good times entertaining myself somehow and until my mother come back five years after.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Okay, and how old were you when you saw your mom? Can you tell me the day that you saw her, how old you were, and then how it felt when you saw her again?Perfecta Contreras:	Okay. I was around 16. I was in the street making mud because I was helping to put mud in the walls because the wind it was too cold and things like that. My Uncle Larry was there low, was coming with a man to the house and he was doing this to make it to go inside.Magdalena de la Vigil:	More task in you to move.Perfecta Contreras:	No, he was doing this from far away and I don't understand. I stayed there until they got there. So then we went inside and then there was a man from a little town that it was over him and he came and asked me if I wanted to go with my mother. I say, I cannot say yes because my uncle was right there and they don't want me to leave and they threaten me not to go. Through the mirror I was coming my head in the mirror and the guy was asking me and the other guy was telling me no. Then I think and I say, ""I don't want to leave until my mother comes over here."" He says, ""But she says for you to go over there"" and I say, ""No. Ask my mother to come over here and then I tell you if I want to go or not."" So that was the way I can avoid my uncle. Then the next day my mother came and the night he was telling me, ""Don't leave, don't leave"" and then I tell him, ""What do you do?""Magdalena de la Vigil:	Who told you to leave?Perfecta Contreras:	My aunt and my uncle.Magdalena de la Vigil:	OkayPerfecta Contreras:	I was living with them.Magdalena de la Vigil:	They were telling you don't leave.Perfecta Contreras:	I wasn't with my father.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You left your father to live with them, yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	So I told them, ""What do you do if you don't see your mother for 10 years and comes for you? What do you do if it was me?"" They keep telling me,""No, it's not good for you to go with your mother"" and I say, ""Well, you know what? Let me go for two weeks and then I'll come back"", and they say, ""Okay."" So I left with my mother and my sister. We left and two weeks after, my uncle came and looked for us. No address, no nothing and he find us in Laredo, Mexico.Interviewer:	How did it feel when you finally saw your mother and got to be with her after all those years? What was that like?Perfecta Contreras:	When I see her, I was very happy. No, my story is so sad that I don't want to tell everything. But when I see my mother because I was crying for her all the time, I was praying to God too, to come and get us because it was infierno how do you call that?Magdalena de la Vigil:	It was like hell.Perfecta Contreras:	Like hell to stay there.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You suffered through physical abuse and sexual abuse.Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah, everything.Magdalena de la Vigil:	A lot of things.Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. So I was very happy with my mother when she showed up but when I went to Laredo after days, I was so confused. I don't know if I love my mother. I don't love my father, I didn't even love myself. So it was very, very on me. But thank God, now I'm so happy because with all of that, I survived. I raised my kid. I got marry. I got divorced just because it was hell too someone out there and marries. But I raised my kids and I have very nice kids. I got married again and my husband I have right now he helped me to raise my grand-kids and I'm happy now because everything goes okay now.Magdalena de la Vigil:	To think back and to think now how your life has come, it's a beautiful thing and even though you have those memories, it's just you survived it like you said.Perfecta Contreras:	I don't know how I survived here in United States because I don't know the language.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Oh yes because you moved with your mom, you stayed with her in-.Perfecta Contreras:	Laredo, Mexico.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Mexico and then you guys moved to United States.Perfecta Contreras:	Yes.Magdalena de la Vigil:	That's when you were in Laredo, Texas?Perfecta Contreras:	Me in San Antonio.Magdalena de la Vigil:	In San AntonioPerfecta Contreras:	I moved to San Antonio, yeah. When my uncle came and look for me, I was already in San Antonio. I left.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I'm going to speed us up because there was another story I wanted to make sure you say. When you had your first baby. I would like you to tell that real quick not real quick as long as you need but the story of you giving birth to.Perfecta Contreras:	When I was pregnant with my first baby, I was very happy when I get pregnant all the time. It was my more important time when I was pregnant when I hear my baby. I started having pains around four o'clock and my husband wasn't good for anything. But I wake him up and I tell him I want to go to my mom and because I'm going to have the baby. He says okay and I say you have to take the mattress because my mother don't have any bed, but I want my mom so she's going to bring me the baby. He could say, ''We don't have any money for doctors, we don't have any money for anything.'' My ex-husband doesn't work. He didn't work, he was a lazy man. I went over there and I got very sick at eight o'clock in the morning. My mother told my sister to go and get something to give me to eat because I was losing my energy and she was afraid that my baby wasn't going to born, I was going to die, so my sister got mad with me and she says no, ''I'm not going to go any where let her die.'' Because my sister, she's mean. Then I still trying and trying until I don't have any energy anymore. We don't have any houses like these, we have just.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Like a shed.Perfecta Contreras:	Something.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Made of wood.Perfecta Contreras:	Not even make out of wood. Something make out of wood. It was a big barrote up there.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Big wooden beam.Perfecta Contreras:	Beam.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	My mother throw.Magdalena de la Vigil:	A rope.Perfecta Contreras:	Rope.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Over a beam.Perfecta Contreras:	It made me get up from the bed and she put me in my knees and she told me, when I have the pain, she told me to pull that rope.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	My baby can come out. This is how my first baby come out.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Was she a boy or a girl?Perfecta Contreras:	She was a girl.Magdalena de la Vigil:	What did she name her?Perfecta Contreras:	Sanjuana Guadalupe.Magdalena de la Vigil:	How did you feel when you first saw her? Your first baby.Perfecta Contreras:	My God, I was crazy with my baby, my first baby.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Then you went on to have your next one?Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah. I was already in San Antonio because I was in Laredo with my mother. I went to Laredo to have my first baby. I don't want to stay here. I went in, but when I was in San Antonio again, when I had my second, that was my boy. I went to the hospital and I said this time is going to be better because I'm in the hospital, but when I was ready to have the baby, they give me some ether and it made me feel so sick. But, I didn't feel that, I felt around three o'clock in the morning that I don't know it was at three o'clock the morning. I heard the nurses say, if she don't wake up by three o'clock in the morning she's going to die. I hear that. When I wake up, it was three o'clock in the morning and I said never and never when I have anything in my body wouldn't to have my babies because I'm going to have them.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Any medication or natural.Perfecta Contreras:	No, medication I'll just go normal.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Natural.Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah natural.Magdalena de la Vigil:	When you saw your son.Perfecta Contreras:	He was a little boy. He was so cute. He had a round little face and his mouth was a little hole, but I was very, very poor then because the husband I had he was not good.Magdalena de la Vigil:	He was, yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	So I started looking for a job.Magdalena de la Vigil:	With two babies.Perfecta Contreras:	With two babies. I went to the Catholic Church to tell me if they know people that they can hire someone with two kids to go wash clothes and iron and clean the house and things like that. So the Father called families and indeed he find me some jobs to do for me to do, a nice job stepping out somehow. Then I used to go with my family to the Michigan on the fields to pick up beets.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Beets, yeah.Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah, and tomatoes. And picking.Magdalena de la Vigil:	All day when you would do work like that, you would live in a place that people would tell you where to live. They give you a place which usually didn't have beds or well did they have beds? And this is in Michigan?Perfecta Contreras:	Michigan, yeah.Magdalena de la Vigil:	What year do you think about?Perfecta Contreras:	I can't remember. Jane was two years old.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I'm going back 63.Perfecta Contreras:	She's 63 was that it?Magdalena de la Vigil:	So 1950s, around there.Perfecta Contreras:	Something like that.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Okay, you would wake up at what time? How was it?Perfecta Contreras:	Very early in the morning and we have to go and get up at six o'clock in the morning because a truck was taking us through the fields. I have a big--.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Box.Perfecta Contreras:	I don't know. Baño they call it in Spanish.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Okay.Perfecta Contreras:	It's a big thing. I take it with me so I can put my two baby in there and under the shade so I can go pick and get something to eat because the husband just leave me then and leave and beat me up and everything. So I have to leave him like I said, I have to get divorced because I can't take it no more. One time I went by myself to pick and I come back and my husband find me I left him. Then I bring some of the money, my mother was very sick and I have to go see her. When I got to San Antonio, I buy a bed and a little stove because I will live in a very little room, but it was a little house. When I come back from seeing my mother, he sold everything. When I come back, it was nothing again.Magdalena de la Vigil:	He sold all your things?Perfecta Contreras:	Yes. I put him in jail. He beat me up too and I put him in jail. So then, ay yai yai, what did I do then?Magdalena de la Vigil:	He sold everything and you moved maybe or you did you try to get away from him again?Perfecta Contreras:	No. Divorce. I got in the Mormon church and I divorce him and then I want to live in Laredo, Texas when I knew you grandfather. I was looking for a job but was very hard too there, seven dollars a week at Laredo, Texas because there was no factories.Magdalena de la Vigil:	No work.Perfecta Contreras:	No work. Only gasoline station because it was very little town. Only restaurants, only hotels. It was very hard to find a job.Magdalena de la Vigil:	This was probably 1950 still 51, 52 around there?Perfecta Contreras:	No. Your mother born in 1953.Magdalena de la Vigil:	So 1953?Perfecta Contreras:	That was like that. So I was cleaning houses . I used to go to the field right there in Laredo, Texas too and pick up some tomatoes. We find this lady the chick try to me and another girl. She says to clean her house every day and to cook for her and she let us stay there. She used to take us to the fields to work for them. When I went on escalera you know how you can just step down to step up on the way I could. This woman that was with me find these two job that it wasn't hamburger stand that we used to serve outside and in the cars.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You deliver to the cars?Perfecta Contreras:	I say I know I don't want to go because they sell beer too. I never work in places like that. I just work in the fields, I work at cleaning houses, but I never work like that. Says you need the money you have your kids. So let's try if you don't like it, then you leave it and then I say, okay. So two blocks from my house was your grandfather's brother and we started working with them over there. After two months I was working there, your grandfather come and he started asking me to go out with him and things are daring him. He moved me to his place because it was two places they belong to two brothers.Magdalena de la Vigil:	He moved you to his restaurant?Perfecta Contreras:	To his restaurant. Then I work with him, I get involved with him and we have your mum.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yeah. Can you tell me about how you felt when you first saw her?Perfecta Contreras:	When I got pregnant I was so proud when I was pregnant. I don't know what it was going to be, if it was going to be a boy or girl. I never know, I never ask.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You did say, unfortunately, we didn't know my grandfather because he left and he wasn't involved with my mother as she grew up in my life. But you did say when you were pregnant, he treated you very well and he made you feel good.Perfecta Contreras:	Very well, he bought everything for your mother. Everything he bought for your mother, he bought me some furniture, he was with us for about two years in heaven Then he got in trouble and didn't know and I know that was true and he has to leave. Then after that, I don't know how long after two or three years, I don't know. I don't remember. I got married with.Magdalena de la Vigil:	My uncle Eddie's dad. Real quick when you saw my mom, like what did you think? How did she look and stuff? Did she come out crying or how did she come out?Perfecta Contreras:	Before I got your mom, I was washing clothes all day because I like to clean my bed all the time because I was expecting her. I feel like I want to go to rest room only all day long and I say why is this way, why do I feel like that? I stay until about 11 o'clock. It was very close.Magdalena de la Vigil:	The pains were close. The feeling.Perfecta Contreras:	The feeling was very close and I said better go to hospital. So I call your grandfather and he wasn't there. So I got in a taxi and I went to the hospital. The taxi driver says, "" Where you going?"" I said, I'm going to the hospital. ""What are you going to do?"" I said I want to have the baby, ""vrooom"" flew to the hospital and then in about a half an an hour your mommy was born in it. I was so happy.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I just have to say we only have nine minutes. But I just have to say that a year ago, this Tuesday, it's been a year, a miraculous thing happened to me in my life. I became a mom. I was engaged and a call was given to me or I answered a phone call and they told me there was a baby that was going to be left at a hospital. And if I was ready to be a parent because people in my life knew adoption was something I wanted to do. Of course, being engaged, I didn't know it was going to happen that day. The next day we brought him home. You were there the whole time. You've been a beautiful part of my baby's life. There's a beautiful song you sing to him and I have to have you sing it a little because every time I hear you put him to sleep when you're over. I just think I'm going to keep that song in my heart, my mind always, because it's just your spirit that comes out when you sing. I'm so happy I became a mom because I could give a human being the love that you and my mom have given me, cause that's what is so strong with you as my grandmother, my 'buelita. I just was wondering if you could just sing a little bit of that song because it's beautiful. You even put 'buelito to sleep with it.Perfecta Contreras:	I sing different ones.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Well just one that comes to mind please pretend he's with you right now. If you don't mind just I love it 'buelita.Perfecta Contreras:	""Duermase mijito, que lo quiero mucho, porque es chiquitito, y es muy bonito, señora Santana ¿por que llora el niño? Por una manzana que se le ha perdido. Vamos a la buelta, cortaremos dos, una para el niño, y otra para vos.""Magdalena de la Vigil:	Thank you. I love it.Perfecta Contreras:	Is it that one? The other one is ""Tengo un muñequito vestido de azul, zapatitos blancos, delantal de tul. Va... "" ay se me olvido. ""Lo lleve a la plaza, se me constipo. Lo traje a la cama con mucho dolor. Dos y dos son cuatro, cuatro y dos son seis. Seis y dos son ocho y ocho dieciséis."" He dances with it.Magdalena de la Vigil:	Yeah. He likes that one. ""Baila, baila."" He loves to dance.Perfecta Contreras:	I love him so much, I love him. It's in my... inside of my heart.Magdalena de la Vigil:	You have a lot of love for all of your family. We all feel it.Perfecta Contreras:	Yeah, for all of my grandkids.Magdalena de la Vigil:	I just hug you when I get strength and love from you. Just by your hug. It was a beautiful thing to be your granddaughter and still be, God you keep going strong. I tell you live past a 100 that'll be fun. I still can't believe how much you do.

MBY006244,"Sara Elena Loaiza: [00:00:00] Sara Elena Loaiza, I'm 47. Today is February 27, 2010. I'm in East Los Angeles, and I am Ara Najarian's significant other for almost 15 years.Ara Najarian: My name's Ara Najarian, and my age is 44, almost 45 in two months. Today's date is February 27, 2010. Location is East Los Angeles, and the relationship to the partner here is the significant other. I was about to say domestic partner. Significant other. My everything.Sara Elena Loaiza: Give me some tissue.Ara Najarian: No tissues yet. So how are you feeling, Sara?Sara Elena Loaiza: I'm okay.Ara Najarian: Okay. So I wanted to talk to you about your family history, and your experience, which I think is simultaneously uniquely American and commonly American. Would you remind me, first of all, of your family lineage on your dad's side and then your mom's side?Sara Elena Loaiza: Okay. My father is Larry Gordon or was Larry Gordon Finkelberg. He shortened the name to Berg shortly after, I think, I was born. But growing up, he always used Finkelberg, so we always call ourselves Finkelberg. Until he reminded me that I needed to really use Berg because Finkelberg was just going to be very difficult for me growing up, Sara Elena Finkelberg. He was born in Los Angeles. Parents, Ida Finkelberg was born in Lithuania, came to the United States in the, we think, early 1900s, and married my grandfather who I never met in St. Louis, Illinois is where they ended up, and they married, I think, in California.Ara Najarian: I didn't know they're in Illinois.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: That's like my parents.Sara Elena Loaiza: Really?Ara Najarian: Yeah.Sara Elena Loaiza: Really?Ara Najarian: Yeah. My older brother was born in Illinois.Sara Elena Loaiza: Oh.Ara Najarian: See?Sara Elena Loaiza: There you go.Ara Najarian: Fifteen years. So how would you describe your father's culture? With Lithuanian or?Sara Elena Loaiza: No. Well, I'm leaving out the most important part, which is that they were Orthodox Jewish, minor detail. So he was raised Orthodox, and so was I, because I went to go live with my grandmother. I'm sure you'll ask me later.Ara Najarian: How old were you when you went to live with your grandmother?Sara Elena Loaiza: I was seven years old when I went to go live with my grandmother.Ara Najarian: Well, tell us about your mom, and your mom's side of the family.Sara Elena Loaiza: On my mom's side of the family, my mother was born in Mexico City. My grandmother, Carmen, my mother's name is Sara Mortera. My grandmother, Carmen, was born in Nicaragua. My grandfather is from Santander, Spain. They met in Veracruz, Mexico and that's a tumultuous story, but anyway, well, he was a very successful business owner.Ara Najarian: He being?Sara Elena Loaiza: My grandfather. His family in Santander raised cotton, and he came to Veracruz to start a, was it tobacco? Tobacco, tobacco plantations. He met my grandmother. She was very young at the time, and fell in love, and they got married. But he was a very jealous man, and unfortunately, my grandmother witnessed him kill someone, and she just thought, ""You know, one day, he's going get mad at me, and I'm going to disappear."" So when she was pregnant with my mother, she left him, and [00:05:00] she went to Mexico City. She raised my mother as a single parent.Ara Najarian: Now, was your grandfather or your grandmother, were they Jewish?Sara Elena Loaiza: My grandmother was not Jewish. Well, see, this is where it gets blurry, because she was, but she didn't practice it.Ara Najarian: She was by birth or what do you mean she was? Did you mean her mother practiced too? How do you?Sara Elena Loaiza: No. They didn't practice Judaism.Ara Najarian: Because they were in Latin America?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. So when she met my grandfather, he was Orthodox. Then when she got pregnant with my mother, and left him, she was afraid that he was going to come after her, so she changed her, there's a lot of drama in this. But she changed her...Ara Najarian: I saw this on a novela.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah, I know. This is a novela. She changed her...Ara Najarian: Religion?Sara Elena Loaiza: Her identity.Ara Najarian: Really? Her whole identity?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah, her whole identity because she was afraid that he was going come after her, so she practiced Catholicism. So my mother was raised Catholic, until she met my father.Ara Najarian: How did she meet your father?Sara Elena Loaiza: She met my father, she would come to the States. My mother was married previously. She got married at a very young age. She was 13 years old. My grandmother, Carmen, was a very hard woman. She was a great woman, but she was very, very hard.Ara Najarian: Your mother grew up in Mexico City?Sara Elena Loaiza: In Mexico City. So my mother was raised by a very strict woman who she used to say, ""If you're going to be bad, you're going to be bad by yourself. If you're going to be good, you're going be good by yourself. But no one's going to influence who you are as a person except me."" So my mother wasn't allowed to have friends. She wasn't allowed to go, and be a normal kid. So at 13, she married a very wealthy Mexican man whose family was very powerful in Mexico City. She had my brother when she was 14. That's why my brother and my mother, basically, are brother and sister. That what they had, a brother and sister.Ara Najarian: That type of relationship?Sara Elena Loaiza: That type of a relationship, yes.Ara Najarian: Then, you said that she would come to United States a lot?Sara Elena Loaiza: Well, what happened when she married my brother's father, and because of the fact that she was so young, and she was raised by a single woman, Nacho's father was just, my older brother Nacho, Ignacio, it was just a bad relationship, and so they got divorced. She was divorced by the time she was, I think, she was probably 19, 20?Ara Najarian: Wasn't that culturally a big deal?Sara Elena Loaiza: It was a huge deal, but everything is.Ara Najarian: How a nice, it's a novela.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. My whole background, it's just unbelievable.Ara Najarian: If I knew you had all this drama beforehand, I'd tell you.Sara Elena Loaiza: It's this drama. Anyway, so she divorced him and the reason why they had such problems is because she divorced him. She had had another child after my brother, and he died of pneumonia within the year, which was just traumatic for her. I mean, she must have been 15 years old when she lost her second child. They had a very successful business in Mexico City it was a restaurant, and she wanted a daughter, and she thought, she's 15 years old, she thought she could have daughters because she had two boys and -- and so one of the, I don't remember if it was one of the people that would come to the restaurant all the time gave up their child and left her on the doorstep, a daughter, and so my mother adopted Diana, and then so that was very traumatic for her too. I mean, just having [00:10:00] two kids, to raise at such a young age and with this husband, who by the way, was 15 years older than she was, which was also very traumatic in a family that's...Ara Najarian: At least dramatic?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes, very dramatic.Ara Najarian: So she is going to be divorced because of assortment of pressures is that what you are getting at?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. Yes. He was a challenging man. I met him when I was I don't know, I was in my teens when I met him.Ara Najarian: Oh yeah.Sara Elena Loaiza: Because he came to live with us for a while.Ara Najarian: Really?Sara Elena Loaiza: Oh, yeah.Ara Najarian: That's more drama.Sara Elena Loaiza: I never told you about this?Ara Najarian: No.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. Well.Ara Najarian: He came to live with Larry.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: His ex-wife?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. They had a very good relationship afterward because Nacho was the link.Ara Najarian: This kind of explains you and your ex-husband's.Sara Elena Loaiza: A little bit.Ara Najarian: Yes, we can all get along, if you obey me. So how long did he live with you?Sara Elena Loaiza: I don't remember.Ara Najarian: Were you very young?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. I was very young. Yeah, so young.Ara Najarian: So but how did your mom came to Los Angeles?Sara Elena Loaiza: So she came to Los Angeles after they got divorced. She'd come on vacation. She would come just to, she had a comadre that lived in Tijuana, and so she would come visit her and they would just come to Los Angeles.Ara Najarian: Every so often?Sara Elena Loaiza: Every so often. My mother married very wealthy and so she was very privileged and was able to come here and vacation, and Nacho went to a private school when he was growing up, and so she was well taken care of. So she would come here and she'd go on vacation, and she met my father. He was working. They went to a, I think it was some type of store, probably a grocery store or some sort of I don't remember where he was working, but he was working, and so the business needed an accountant, and my mother was an accountant. That's what she went to school for, and so they wanted to hire her as the accountant.Ara Najarian: How did they know she was an accountant?Sara Elena Loaiza: Mutual friends, and my father fell in love with her the moment he saw her.Ara Najarian: Did he speak Spanish?Sara Elena Loaiza: No, he actually failed every Spanish course he ever took.Ara Najarian: I feel his pain.Sara Elena Loaiza: His high school.Ara Najarian: Entiendo entiendo.Sara Elena Loaiza: He went to Fairfax High School, and at Fairfax High school, his teacher told him that he should never take the Spanish language again because he was ruining it, and so then he meets my mother who doesn't speak English, and she ignores him because she, first of all, my father the only thing going for him at that time was that he had really beautiful blue eyes and dark hair, but he's not very tall. I think he was 5'7, and my mother and Nacho's father was about 5'8.Ara Najarian: She didn't speak English either, right?Sara Elena Loaiza: No, but she had attitude. She just was like, ""why are you even speaking to me?"" and ""you don't even speak Spanish.""Ara Najarian: Did she want to learn English?Sara Elena Loaiza: No. Never.Ara Najarian: Why not?Sara Elena Loaiza: Because she didn't like the sound of it. She said that she thought it was the most horrible language to listen to, and so she never learned.Ara Najarian: So he had to learn Spanish.Sara Elena Loaiza: She understood it. We know this as a family, that she understood it, but she never spoke it. So people would have to speak Spanish if they wanted to communicate with her, and so he learned.Ara Najarian: Wow.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. What love will do to you.Ara Najarian: Yes. Entiendo. So, how did they even start the courtship if it had to take him a while to learn Spanish.Sara Elena Loaiza: No, he learned pretty quickly.Ara Najarian: Yeah.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. Well, he learned the basics pretty quickly. Because he immersed in it, you have to speak to someone who does not speak English, first of all, and so you have to communicate.Ara Najarian: [00:15:00] But he didn't have to when he met her, right?Sara Elena Loaiza: When he met her, he had to speak to her in Spanish.Ara Najarian: Oh, for the accounting, because she took the job, I take it.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes, she took the job.Ara Najarian: Why did she take the job?Sara Elena Loaiza: She wanted to live in Los Angeles.Ara Najarian: Totally starts here.Sara Elena Loaiza: It would be different.Ara Najarian: Came to live in Los Angeles.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. So she thought it would be great for Nacho. So, and he would learn English, and so she thought, and I guess eventually my father was successful in courting her.Ara Najarian: I guess so.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: They had kids?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. Yes.Ara Najarian: It's a sure sign. Persuasive at least. So then I know that, was it Larry's bakery, Larry's produce mart?Sara Elena Loaiza: It had different names, the first time they open a business.Ara Najarian: They left wherever she was accounting and he opened his own business?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: Which was the produce mart or was that a bakery?Sara Elena Loaiza: Larry's Next Day Bakery was the name of the business, yes.Ara Najarian: That was in Linc?Sara Elena Loaiza: Lincoln Heights and I want to say 1960, I think it was 1960 when he opened his business. Shortly thereafter she got pregnant with me or maybe 1961 because I was born in 1962. It was interesting because when she got pregnant with me, he didn't believe that I was his because he had had mono when he was in high school and the doctor just told him he could not have children.Ara Najarian: Think of the ramifications of that.Sara Elena Loaiza: Oh my God, more drama.Ara Najarian: That was the line he used on every girl he ever meet.Sara Elena Loaiza: No.Ara Najarian: That's your dad man.Sara Elena Loaiza: Larry. He was a nerd, he didn't have a lot of social skills.Ara Najarian: It's okay, let's get back to you.Sara Elena Loaiza: Okay. Well this is my background, this is him.Ara Najarian: I know.Sara Elena Loaiza: It explains a lot.Ara Najarian: Your family was living in Lincoln Heights?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: Didn't you tell me that it was hard for them to find a place to live because he was white?Sara Elena Loaiza: After me.Ara Najarian: After you?Sara Elena Loaiza: After me, but it was difficult.Ara Najarian: Describe what they went through?Sara Elena Loaiza: It's 1962 and she has me, this is important, she has me in Mexico. I was born in Tijuana and the reason why I was born in Tijuana, and I say this a lot because it's important for people to understand that it's still happening now. When my mother was here, she only spoke Spanish and her doctor was the only doctor at that time in East Los Angeles that spoke Spanish, Dr. Contreras. He pretty much delivered most of the Latinas.Ara Najarian: Dr. Figueroa, but you didn't know about him then?Sara Elena Loaiza: I didn't know Dr. Figueroa.Ara Najarian: But there were a couple.Sara Elena Loaiza: But there was a couple.Ara Najarian: Not very many.Sara Elena Loaiza: No.Ara Najarian: Probably not very many with privileges at the hospital.Sara Elena Loaiza: No, at that time White Memorial, yes.Ara Najarian: That's probably the key point though, all right?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. He would go on vacation in the summer and in the winter and my mother was due in July, which is the summer and he was going on vacation. My mother panicked and at that time got my 15 year old brother.Ara Najarian: Perhaps when she broke water, you mean or panic?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes and she knew that he was on vacation and she says, ""I'm not going to go to a hospital where they don't speak Spanish"" which is ironic White Memorial.Ara Najarian: Now, there all other patients speak Spanish?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yup.Ara Najarian: Where was your dad at this time?Sara Elena Loaiza: Larry was working.Ara Najarian: When her water broke?Sara Elena Loaiza: He was working.Ara Najarian: He was working and not having cell phones in those days?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: What happened?Sara Elena Loaiza: My brother Nacho, drove her with his learner's permit, I think that's what he had at the time and three hours, because it would take three hours to get to Tijuana back then, well, not with traffic, but he drove her to Tijuana so that I could be born. So she could be in Mexico [00:20:00] if something happened.Ara Najarian: It's not that she didn't want you to be born in Mexico, she wanted to be in a hospital where people could understand her language, right?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes, and culture. It wasn't just the language. She wanted to be able to feel like she was comfortable.Ara Najarian: Something happened that she could communicate and be taken care of.Sara Elena Loaiza: She did had other children, she had gone to the hospital. It wasn't as though this was a new experience for her. This was something that she had experienced before and so she wanted to make sure that she had a comfortable experience and she knew that her comadre was in Tijuana and so she said ""¿Me llevas con mi comadre?"" And my brother drove three hours and I didn't make it to the hospital where she had already made arrangements for me to be born at, which at that time in Tijuana it's the Hospital De Tijuana.Ara Najarian: How did she make it, did she call her comadre?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes, they had communication throughout her pregnancy with me and she knew I was breached. I was breached and she knew that there might be complications. She gets into Tijuana.Ara Najarian: But I thought your dad didn't know that she was going to have you in Mexico?Sara Elena Loaiza: He didn't. She took off.Ara Najarian: So she did all these plans without telling your dad?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: Sneaky.Sara Elena Loaiza: Well, she knew he would object because he said our child will be raised and will be born in the United States and will be a United States citizen and my mother didn't care about citizenship. My mother wanted to be at a place where they could understand her language, and her culture. I was born in the hospital that when as soon as you cross the border, the nearest hospital which was a general hospital, Hospital General and they take donations. My mother had three dollars on her and it cost three dollars.Ara Najarian: So you're a three dollar baby.Sara Elena Loaiza: I am a three dollar baby.Ara Najarian: At least not the 99 cent baby.Sara Elena Loaiza: I know that my father didn't speak Spanish very well because when I was born he called me butter. Well yes, manteca, lard. He wanted to say muñeca but he called me lard instead.Ara Najarian: Muñeca means?Sara Elena Loaiza: Muñeca is doll.Ara Najarian: So after you were born, she came back and you guys grew up in Lincoln Heights for at least?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. After I was born they tried to find a place to live in Lincoln Heights, and it was very difficult because they were an interracial couple. It was very challenging for them.Ara Najarian: Well, Lincoln Heights was mostly white Italian at that time?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. Very Italian.Ara Najarian: Hard to believe now, huh? You think Boyle Heights was all Jewish and Lincoln Heights was all Italian? You go across it now and it's dominantly Mexican-American?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: So what was it like growing up in Lincoln Heights?Sara Elena Loaiza: Well, our first place that we lived was in Boyle Heights actually, that I can remember. Right near USC Medical Center.Ara Najarian: USC Keck?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: Do you remember if you had other neighbors that were, I guess bi-cultural? The place they found to live.Sara Elena Loaiza: My parents didn't have a lot of friends. They didn't socialize. Before I went to live with my grandmother, I grew up in an environment where they didn't socialize. They didn't have friends. They worked 24/7.Ara Najarian: Yeah. By the time you were going to elementary school or whatever, the Lincoln Heights had already become dominated Latino though, right?Sara Elena Loaiza: No.Ara Najarian: No?Sara Elena Loaiza: No.Ara Najarian: Okay. So when you were in elementary school, were you aware that you were Latino?Sara Elena Loaiza: No. I never grew up aware.Ara Najarian: Or were you aware that you were Jewish or...Sara Elena Loaiza: No.Ara Najarian: ...Catholic. What was your self-identity as a kid at that time? You've got all these mixes of cultures here in Lincoln Heights was at that time or transitioning from [00:25:00] white Italian Boyle Heights dominated by Jewish. Yeah. So what do you remember?Sara Elena Loaiza: I remember coming home one day. We had moved to Highland Park.Ara Najarian: You stayed in Highland Park too?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. We moved to Highland Park because of the challenges that we were facing as a family because of my mother being Mexican and my father being very white and very Jewish. It was very challenging to live in Lincoln Heights at the time. Even though my father had a business there, even though my parents had a business there, it was not welcoming. So they found a beautiful home to rent in Highland Park on Figueroa what's now part of the Historical Preservation Society.Ara Najarian: It was a craftsman, wasn't it?Sara Elena Loaiza: It was a craftsman home, yes off of Figueroa. I went to school in Aldama. Aldama elementary school, and I remember coming home.Ara Najarian: Highland Park, how would you describe its cultural?Sara Elena Loaiza: It was mixed. It was not predominantly Latino. There was a lot of Latinos, but it wasn't predominantly Latino. It was very mixed.Ara Najarian: We're talking what, mid to late '60s?Sara Elena Loaiza: It was '67, something like that.Ara Najarian: So you say mix, white, Latino, black?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: Maybe some Asian.Sara Elena Loaiza: There was some Asian and there was like maybe one black person in our elementary school.Ara Najarian: Was it middle-class, or low-income? Do you have a sense of it at all?Sara Elena Loaiza: I don't have a sense.Ara Najarian: It's hard to when you're that age.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. I really didn't. I never. That's one thing when growing up, we never felt poor, we never felt rich. We never felt middle-class. We just were. But I guess we were middle-class at that time because we were able to rent a house and it was a big house. I remember my neighbor downstairs was blind and she was a sweetheart. She was able to go to school by herself and she was able to not walk by herself, but she had a lot of independence.Ara Najarian: How old was she compared to you?Sara Elena Loaiza: Couple of years older, I think. But anyway, I remember coming home one day.Ara Najarian: From Aldama?Sara Elena Loaiza: From Aldama.Ara Najarian: Was that at elementary school?Sara Elena Loaiza: Elementary school. Because I was being bullied. There were these other Mexican girls in a class, I think I was in second grade. I came home one day and my teacher at the time was this African American woman. I don't remember her name, but I came home and I was crying.Ara Najarian: Why were you bullied? What was the bullying?Sara Elena Loaiza: The bullying because my last name. Because I wanted to be Buffy. My mother would at night curl my hair.Ara Najarian: So was it Family Affair, the TV show?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. The TV show. I wanted to Buffy. So my mother would curl my hair and so she would curl my hair and in the morning of course, you now got straight hair, so that didn't last. But I would go to school with these little ringlets. My mother had my clothes made for me by this woman who was a seamstress. So I was very fortunate growing up.Ara Najarian: Yeah. You are definitely middle-class it sounds like if not better according to some, right?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah. Well, I just think that this is what my mother was used to.Ara Najarian: Sure. No one is pulling judgment on it.Sara Elena Loaiza: I know.Ara Najarian: It is what it is.Sara Elena Loaiza: Anyway, so I came home one day and I was crying and I didn't want to go to school anymore.Ara Najarian: But you were bullied about?Sara Elena Loaiza: About my last name.Ara Najarian: What does it have to do with your hair and girls and Buffy?Sara Elena Loaiza: Because I wanted to be...Ara Najarian: You're Buffy Berg and the girls at school didn't like that?Sara Elena Loaiza: Finkelberg. It was horrible. They teased me about my last name. They said that I wasn't Mexican. They said I was white and they didn't like me for whatever reason and it was a problem.Ara Najarian: So they said you [00:30:00] are white. How did you identify yourself at that time?Sara Elena Loaiza: I didn't. This whole identity thing.Ara Najarian: Why would it bother you that they said you were white?Sara Elena Loaiza: It bothered me that they were bullying me because they were making fun of my last name and that bothered me. I didn't want to go to school anymore because I said, ""I don't want to be feeling like this."" So long story short, my father said you don't have to go back to that school. My grandmother had been a widow for a few years, and my father thought it would be appropriate for Ida Finkelberg to have some company. So I went to live with my grandmother at seven.Ara Najarian: Where did your grandmother live?Sara Elena Loaiza: She lived in the Fairfax district.Ara Najarian: How did you find out or what happened?Sara Elena Loaiza: Well, what happened was I was at the store one day and the phone rang and I picked up the phone and ""Larry's Next Day Bakery, how can I help you?"" I picked up the phone and she was on the other hand, she says, ""who's this?"" I said. I said ""this is Larry's daughter, who's this?"" She fainted, I guess. Because she didn't know I existed.Ara Najarian: Did you hear thud on the other end?Sara Elena Loaiza: I didn't hear a thud at the other end, but I know that this was what happened. Because Nacho tells me this, that she fainted after she heard my voice because Larry had not told her that he had had a child. So I didn't meet her until I was seven years old. Oh, Larry. And because my mother was not a practicing Jew, and so my grandmother disowned him after he told her that he married my mother. But now there's a child and there's actually more than one.Ara Najarian: How many brothers and sisters you have with your father?Sara Elena Loaiza: My mother had two other children with my father. David, my younger brother and Jackie, my younger sister. They were all born, they were all alive at that time. So she met us all at the same time and then I got dropped off.Ara Najarian: So that was your preparation.Sara Elena Loaiza: That was my preparation.Ara Najarian: They packed your bags for you, what happened?Sara Elena Loaiza: I don't remember, I just remember all of a sudden my life was upside down.Ara Najarian: You were?Sara Elena Loaiza: I was now living with a stranger in the Fairfax District.Ara Najarian: This elderly woman, Jewish.Sara Elena Loaiza: Orthodox.Ara Najarian: Orthodox Jew in the Fairfax District going to...Sara Elena Loaiza: A new school.Ara Najarian: A new school that was dominantly Jewish kids.Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: Going to Hebrew school?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes. I'd grown up going to temple. I knew that I was Jewish but I wasn't going to Hebrew school.Ara Najarian: So your dad would still go to temple and you'd go with him?Sara Elena Loaiza: Oh, Yeah. Absolutely, we practiced Judaism at home. Yeah.Ara Najarian: So then but now you were in a school where they are mixed, where there are a lot of brown, lot of white.Sara Elena Loaiza: It was mixed, then the bullying started again because.Ara Najarian: Were you a bullying magnet?Sara Elena Loaiza: I must have been growing up. It was challenging because now I was being bullied by the Jews. Before it was Latinos bullying me because of my last name and now the Jews didn't believe I was Jewish. How could I be Jewish if I'm Mexican, I don't look like them, I speak another language and it's not Hebrew. It was a challenging situation.Ara Najarian: So let's fast forward to your business, you started your own business?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yeah.Ara Najarian: How does all that have an impact. Your company is called Latino Consultants?Sara Elena Loaiza: Yes.Ara Najarian: So identity is built into the name. We work with various groups that have names, Latino and the Hispanic. You're in the board of the Mexican Cultural Institute. There's all these I don't know if we can call them pride labels but identifiers that whether it's Chicano or whatever. How do you feel about those types of names being on.Sara Elena Loaiza: Honestly.Ara Najarian: Yeah.Sara Elena Loaiza: I don't think of, because I was raised Jewish. I know that I'm a [00:35:00] Mexican-American because I was born in Mexico and I'm an American citizen or US citizen. But I personally do not understand all of that. I know that there are people, my friends, my colleagues, my family, that have self identifiers, strong self identification. I've always just never done that. The company is called Latino Consultants because in 1995, I felt that there needed to be a business that dedicated themselves to helping organizations understand the Latino community that's why it's called Latino Consultants, I felt that I could serve that void. At the time in 1995 there weren't many companies that were helping, especially health care organizations understand the Latino community. In 1995, or '97, or '98, or '99, Latinos had maybe diabetes now it's one in.Ara Najarian: One in two graduate high school with it.Sara Elena Loaiza: One and two, right.Ara Najarian: Yeah. I guess I'm more interested in this American perspective of we have all these different cultures and there's so much pride. I often tell people I'm Indian but I'm just as much, my mom is a Norwegian, my grandfather is from Norwegian in my mom side. So there's ways that people identify, what's the impact of identification you think in terms of community and culture in Los Angeles, does it make a difference? Is there needed to identify or is there?Sara Elena Loaiza: I think it helps people. I think it's something that most people that I know feel pride in their identity. I feel very proud to have had such a rich background now as an adult. As a child growing up, it was it was chaotic.Ara Najarian: How does your daughter identify?Sara Elena Loaiza: That's a good question because I didn't raise her with this strong sense of this is who you are. Your mother is a Latina-Jewish woman, I didn't raise her that way. I just raised her that, we're Jewish and this is our culture. When you grow up Jewish that's your identification, it's your religion, it's your culture. All my friends were eating. Well now I meet people they talk about quinceañeras, I didn't have that. I grew up in Hebrew school, I went to Temple every Saturday. I grew up with you don't turn on the electricity, you celebrate the Sabbath. So that's your identification.Ara Najarian: So do you think Natalie, your daughter, do you think that she is more accepting of all cultures as result of that or do you think it's just...?Sara Elena Loaiza: I think so, I think absolutely because I raised her that way, I wanted her to grow up feeling as though she didn't have that self-identification, that there was nothing wrong with her. I think that's one of the reasons why she was so open at a young age to come out and tell me that she was gay.Ara Najarian: Was she interested in your background and how your parents met and things like that and all that growing up?Sara Elena Loaiza: Not really. She's young she's 25, right now it's all about her and I'm glad it's all about her. I'm so glad she's...Ara Najarian: Did she have questions, did she like why does my dad's family go to church and why do we go to temple, things like that?Sara Elena Loaiza: No, isn't that interesting?Ara Najarian: It is.Sara Elena Loaiza: She never questioned it, she just always knew that her mother was Jewish and I always knew. Just the same way, I guess we have that in common. There was never that curiosity.Ara Najarian: Yeah. So we are at a place where we are about to wrap up. But [00:40:00] what's the thing that your hope is for whether be America, or family. Or what are your hopes and dreams for Natalie in terms of how her culture helps her or doesn't. Do you want it to be a strength or do you think that it's better that she doesn't worry about identifying.Sara Elena Loaiza: My hope is that our world becomes a more accepting world, because if we don't...Ara Najarian: We get to clean it.Sara Elena Loaiza: I know. If we don't become a more accepting world, it'll be such a hard thing for my daughter and people and her generation. She's so accepting of other people and she's had it very difficult because she came out very early. She's had jobs that judge her in such a way that I don't know. I just hoped that we become a more accepting world.Ara Najarian: Me too. I love you.Sara Elena Loaiza: I love you too.Ara Najarian: Thanks.Sara Elena Loaiza: Thanks.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
MBY006255,"Barbara: [00:00:00] I'm Barbara Chicaris. My middle name is Irene. I'm 63 years of age, and today's date is Sunday, February 28th, 2010. I am at the East LA location and my relationship to my partner is that he will be interviewing me today.Alejandro: Hi, my name is Alejandro De La Cruz. I'm 28 years old. Today is February 28th, 2010. I am in East Los Angeles and I'm here with Barbara, who I just met about five minutes ago. Hi Barbara.Barbara: Hi.Alejandro: If you wanted to start off with what your childhood was like, where did you grow up?Barbara: I grew up in the Santa Monica in Pacific Palisade, Santa Monica California, Pacific Palisade's area. So primarily, West Los Angeles. I was born in Santa Monica. I haven't traveled too far. I do know the Los Angeles area very well for two reasons. One, my father's factory, which was located in Santa Monica. I was like his girl Friday, and I ran a lot of errands for him as I was in high school and in college. Then working in Los Angeles Unified School District as an administrator and in a variety of different roles, I had the opportunity to work the whole Unified School District from East Los Angeles to West Los Angeles from the Valley down to the San Pedro area. So I'm comfortable even though I haven't really moved out of this area of the city for all my grownup years. I'm curious as to I don't know a lot of family history. That's why this particular activity was interesting to me because I think we need to memorialize a lot of what has happened, especially to those of us Mexican Americans who grew up in the '40s, '50s and '60s and primarily a white culture, primarily in areas of the city where Spanish was not accepted, I grew up in Catholic schools my whole life from kindergarten through five years of college at Mount St. Mary's. Again, for the reason that my dad did not understand the value of higher education for girls and the only way I could go to college to live my dream of becoming a teacher was to go to a Catholic women's college. That gives you a little bit of a history of my background.Alejandro: So tell me, what was your household like?Barbara: I'm the oldest of 10 children. When we moved from Santa Monica, there were four of us, children in the late '40s and early '50s. My parents were able to locate a home in the Palisades area because it was next door to a convent. It was cheap because no one wanted to live next door to Catholic nuns. So it was out in the market for about a year and a half. When they purchased it, my mother was able to really do the purchasing through my dad because my dad looks like me or I look like my dad and my mother could pass for white, although she was Mexican.Alejandro: Were your parents born here?Barbara: Both of them were born here in Los Angeles. Well, this is interesting because I just found out recently asking for a birth certificate of mine that my dad was born in Sacramento. We had always assumed he was born here in Los Angeles. He grew up in east LA, my mom grew up around the Coliseum area and such. The story is that when things were okay for my dad, he was youngest of 10 children. They lived on the other side of what is now the 110 freeway when his father was not in jail for bootlegging and doing other things. My mom's family, she grew up in a middle-class family, even though it was during the '20s, '30s, and '40s. I would say predominantly because they were five adults living in her house, her mother and her father, and her three aunts. There were only three children, and my grandfather worked for the Southern Pacific railroads. My grandmother and her sisters worked for department stores like Bullocks Wilshire and such and they seemed so stressed. Anyway, they worked in the alteration department. My mom grew up in a, which I would say was more affluent for Mexicans at that time and such. So they were really in contrast and culture my parents, when they got married in '45. Now, my dad was a graduate of Manual Arts High School and you may know where that's located, down by the Coliseum. It's right there by USA, and he was beginning student at UCLA as an engineer in 1939. He was then drafted. He wanted to be an Air Force pilot, but he couldn't be because he was Mexican. Then the story in the family is that once Pearl Harbor occurred, then he was able to be transferred to the Air Force core and he became a pilot and did a lot of bombings in Germany. [00:05:00] This is where I'm unclear, but anyway, his plane one time he had to evacuate for a man and he was picked up by the French resistance, and he didn't talk a lot. But my brothers seemed to know more of the history of my dad's world war 2 experience. When the war was over, he and my mom got married in July of '45, and they were scheduled to go to Texas and he was to train pilots. But that was before they had dropped a bomb in Japan. They got married in July. A bomb happened in August, war was over, and that's when then he started to work for his sister. A jewelry manufacturing in Santa Monica. That's why I understand the family moved from downtown or East LA and then relocated into the Santa Monica area. Now, for me growing up, looking different, going to school with primarily Irish Catholics and also not speaking English. It was really an adjustment for me, and that's why I was anxious to participate in this because I think there's a whole area that has a history in the United States, not understanding what some of us gave up in terms of our culture to become part of the mainstream.Alejandro: So can you talk about some of those experiences when you were going to school?Barbara: Well, one experience, at kindergarten, for instance, at St. Monica's kindergarten, I did not understand anything going on when I walked into the classroom, except for knowing that everything was foreign to me. Everybody looked foreign to me. Thank God for Mrs. Connolly, the kindergarten teacher who heard nonverbal behavior towards me, made me feel accepted. But I will say I cried every single day. Every single day my mom picked me up from kindergarten with my younger three brothers and sisters and the youngest one was about less than a year old, and they understood what I was going through in terms of the transition. We moved from Santa Monica then to the Palisades area. When I was in first grade, living next door to the convent, who were our teachers at school and then after school, they were our next door neighbors. We became very friendly with them, needless to say. The nuns told my parents she's going to need to be retained in first grade because she doesn't know English and reading was really difficult for me. So my parents being totally biliterate, flipped 180 percent to speaking English because right behind me was a brother in kindergarten and another one ready to start kindergarten. Because of that, reading for me was challenging and even in grade school, if I came across words such as island, I would have to say in my mind before it became my turn to read, terms such as Island. I wouldn't make the mistake of saying Island because everything for me with sight vocabulary. I was really clear at volunteering and my eighth grade year in a first grade classroom, the power of a teacher, which then became my dream at 13, that I want to become a teacher. My mom supported my dream. But then that became like a real hot and heavy subject between my mom and dad because my dad was [inaudible 00:08:26] . No, I was going to work at his factory. No, I was not going on to college, and that's what ended up happening with me, going into a women's college, Mount St. Mary's College in the West LA area.Alejandro: So I want to get back real quick to, how difficult do you think it was for your parents to just full on start speaking English with you and cutout Spanish basically. Did they ever talk about that?Barbara: No, they didn't. But we lived a real bicultural life. My dad's back to re-employed primarily Mexicans who would leave their families in Tijuana, and this was during the '50s and '60s. They would work 56 hour weeks. They would leave Saturday afternoons and then go to T.J for the weekend, spend time with their family, and they'd be back at work at eight o'clock on Monday mornings. So to witness my parents, they seemed to do it flawlessly. Now for me in school when my girlfriends would come over on a Sunday afternoon and if our relatives were there, what are they saying? What's going on? What are those smells? If we talked about frijoles and all of that. So for me, it was embarrassment. My dad's name was Tito. So you'd read about history books with President Tito in Yugoslavia and such and kids would tease you. Because I look different and my brothers look different too, I imagine it's a lot like with the African-American experiences in a white culture too. Now my [00:10:00] dad being a blue-collar worker and I can remember on the block being grateful that he left for work at 6:30 in the morning, whereas everybody else on the block looked like their fathers are readers where they would go out with their briefcases and their suits on and such, I was just grateful that the neighbors didn't see him. But at the same time, he was a kind of a person that everybody gravitated to because of his charisma. When he died of a heart attack at 48 and I was 22 and my youngest in the family, my youngest sister was five, I didn't realize the power of my dad and the respect that he had had in the community, in the Palisades, his involvement in the Catholic church up there, and also the respect that he had in the business community until his funeral really to realize how powerful he was. Now at the same time too here we are living, my mom and I through the civil rights era for women. This is the late '60s now when he died in '69 and I was just graduating from college and to recognize that he basically do not believe in women's rights. He was doing the best he can. Now I understand that, but I was an advocate for my mom to stand up for her rights and be able to be treated with respect and not with what I had grown up with. So to transition to a teacher in the district was really a powerful opportunity for me because I could see the power of a teacher having had the experience in that first-grade classroom with Sister Miguel when I used to volunteer in her room, and the remembrance I had at my kindergarten teacher with her non-verbal behavior, I was real clear that I wanted to be that kind of a teacher, even though I worked in South Central West, predominately black at that time. But then ironically, my principal asked me to join a bilingual program in 1974. I said, ""How can I teach Spanish really when I don't even speak Spanish? I can't even roll my R's."" ''But you're the only Mexican-American teacher here in South Central. We need you to start this program.'' He was a visionary administrator. A year after being in that classroom, they asked me to go work downtown in the headquarters of LA City Schools because he said, ""We need teachers like you who can demonstrate how you can work with a bilingual assistant because the reality is we're not going to have all the bilingual teachers we need at the district."" Then I suddenly realized that my career took off in a way that I was on the cutting edge of whatever reforms that were going on in the district. I feel really grateful for that opportunity because like my first principal assignment at Mount Washington, I couldn't understand why I was being sent to a middle-class school where I had done all my work in South Central or in year-round schools and they said to me, ""Because you know how to straddle the brown world and the white world. Although you don't speak Spanish, we're going to need to start by seeing English learners and bilingual and Mexican-American children to this white community. We need you to work the white community and we also need you to help the Hispanic parents understand that their kids will be safe."" The unfortunate thing is because my Spanish is very poor, I couldn't really communicate that to the Hispanic parents. But what Hispanic parents told me over and over again, ''We rather have our children in the school where they're going to become bilingual than where they've been in these year-round schools in the district where they're only learning Spanish and they're not good in their English.'' They felt safe where they were with in our school. I realized then again I've had an opportunity to create a niche that was given to me that I didn't understand. Another time that happened in the district was in the '90s where we were asked to intervene where parents were upset with, I hate to say this, with Spanish-speaking administrators and parents would just tell me in Spanish, ''We just need an administrator here who has a heart. We don't necessarily need an administrator who is bilingual. We just need an administrator who's going to care about our kids.'' So here I felt like caught between my culture, caught between the fact that I don't speak Spanish, but caught with the fact that all kids deserve to have the best regardless of where they are in school, and so I feel like the yin and the yang, it's been my whole life. It has been uncomfortable at times, but it also has made me passionate to be there for the underdog no matter who it is. Although I learned English from Irish nuns who came over here from Ireland, obviously, and learned words for the sofa was a Chesterfield, [00:15:00] the vacuum cleaner was a Hoover and at that time I didn't know that that's not what they were, but that's what I was learning. So in a quick sense, that capitalizes on my experience in a variety of arenas.Alejandro: I'm just curious, you've been speaking about your father and the factory. What kind of factory was it?Barbara: He was in jewelry manufacturing and because of the fact that he was working for his sister and his brother-in-law, he was the manager of the factory. He didn't own it, but pretty much he owned it because they knew he was really good with people. I have to honestly say his way of managing his 37 employees gave me the opportunity to see things way before I became a school administrator. As he started each day by walking to each of the units within his factory to say hi to people, check in with them, ''Alejandro, how was your evening last night, how was your wife because I know she was sick and such,"" it taught me how you manage by wandering around. I learned a lot of things from him and didn't realize how much people loved him like I said until he died and then everyone had stories to tell about his generosity, about his loaning them money so that their kids could be in parochial school, stories that our family had no understanding or no awareness of.Alejandro: I'm just curious because you're talking now about basically almost being held back when you were in first grade and things like that, but it seems like you've progressed and you did progress. What was your education like after those few years where English was such an obstacle? What was your middle school and high school experience like, especially as a young Latina in the 1950s?Barbara: Fifties and '60s. I would say because once my parents understood what the nuns were saying and when they switched, my mom then started to read to us in English all the time. So I have very warm memories of that and that's why I'm very passionate for parents, especially Hispanics to read to their little ones even before they're born. But on the other side of it is I did struggle at school and I would say a couple of my best friends helped me because anything having to do with a written word was terrifying for me. So even to come across word problems in math and it was until my best friend from first grade and we're still friends to this day, would substitute names and the word problems of my brothers and sisters, then it just clicked for me. Okay, this is not too terrifying. She has personalized it. I can get this. The nuns took an interest in our family. So when they had Saturday school, for instance, one example was having us come in during the eighth grade for us to do pre-algebra because the principal said, ''I know you're going to experience algebra in high school. I now want to give you girls a head start.'' I should not have been in that group but because I lived next door she included me. My dad was adamant, ''You're going to go,'' and it was a struggle for me but it was an advantage at the same time. Now because of the community that we lived in when I went to high school, that was a huge, terrifying experience. Again, because of the fact that I could see the Hispanics were primarily classified for clerical classes or home economics. Because of the elementary high school I came from, I was in the college prep classes. That made me start to become aware of the social issues that were impacting my friends too. So that was a whole other experience.Alejandro: What did you do to try to alleviate that.Barbara: Well, part of it was I was I jokester in school, Alejandro, but I also recognize the fact that, hey, we're all the same, and only because of the elementary school I came from, why should I be interested in these classes and such. So I did a combination. I did take some home economic classes, I did take some clerical classes. I don't know why. It just felt I didn't want to stand out anymore as being different, and yet in some ways, I diminished myself not saying that I was in with those classes, but I lowered my own standards because of that I want to be part the crowd. For the first time to go to school with Hispanics, that was a huge new awareness for me, not having ever had that before. I started volunteering at Hispanic churches in the Santa Monica West, Los [00:20:00] Angeles area, teaching CCD classes on Saturdays and such. Because again, it was like, wow, there's so much I don't know about our culture. Although I started to say a few minutes ago that my dad's factory was totally Mexican-American during the week, we would work there on Saturdays because he expected us to be at the factory. I can remember on Sundays driving to some of his employees houses, bringing a pot, so that they could fill it up with menudo for my dad on a Sunday morning. So it was like, I never really knew which world that we were in. I knew when I was at school, it was an English world, a white world, and yet at home, it was another world, and yet, there were many times I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I'm thinking of a specific time now. Elementary school, during the '50s, large Irish Catholic families, they would hire a Mexican-American housekeepers. I would come home from school to discover that my mom would be translating for, let's say, a housekeeper at Mrs. so and so's house. The mother would be there and she would be saying to my mom, ""I want her to wash the floor in this way. Here's the product, can you please explain to her this is what she's supposed to do?"" My mom would be translating. Now, part of me was intrigued with the fact that my mom was popular in a way, but the other part of me would get anxious because I'd be thinking, ""Okay, dinner is not on the table, I'm the oldest, dad's going to be coming home at 7:00 o'clock, he's not going to understand that mom's playing this community service role after school and such."" My mom and dad both were very generous at the time and people really loved each of them. But it would make me anxious because I would think, ""Okay, people aren't going to understand what's happened here."" That happened a lot and lot because at that time, there were a lot of large Irish Catholic families in the palisade section and we all went to the same school. But as the years went on, then I started to understand people who had changed their last names in the community too, who had maybe changed Martinez to Martin. I started to become more aware of who did speak Spanish as I went in the higher years of elementary.Alejandro: When did you start becoming aware of that?Barbara: I would say it was about in the 7th and 8th grade, and when mom and dad would be talking Spanish. Let me give you an example. The dentist wife, she spoke Spanish, Rebecca, and I said to mom why is she speaking Spanish? Mom said, well, because she's Mexican. I knew who the dentist was because we went to his office. So it started to teach me then about ethnicities and such. My dad did a lot of business, obviously the jewelry business, with Jewish people. It was the best nation that grew on me in terms of last names, in terms of their culture. Many of them were recent concentration camp victims so my dad taught me a lot about that area. I still, to this day, have a fascination with World War II, what my dad did as the serviceman, the whole era. But again, I just heard snippets, and that's why I still regret that he died at 48. I didn't really get to capture his words, and that's why I think this particular project is huge that you're doing nationally, to capture all of our stories regardless of where we come from.Alejandro: So going back to just your community, you were talking about how you were having issues like struggling being of Mexican descent and then living in the white world. Do you still see Los Angeles like that?Barbara: No, not at all. I'm so glad.Alejandro: How is it progressed?Barbara: It's funny you should say that. I think we've progressed, and then here, I come to this library today and I am so astonished that there are so many young families here, and yet there is a negative perception that families are together in our culture. That the library is so packed and they're asking for reservations for the computers and it was so cognizant that in my family, we don't have to worry about the computers. We don't have to go to a library just for reservation time. I'm also cognizant right now. I waited in line for 10 minutes just to be able to use the ladies room and I'm thinking, where is this existing? here in the city of Los Angeles today on a Sunday. Did you have to wait 10 minutes in line because there's so many people in front of me with books that they want to check out for their children? Again, it rages me that there's such a negative perception about our culture, and that we're not about education, and that we're all about gangs and that families don't matter. Another experience I'm going through [00:25:00] with that is, I'll have retired two years in June. I started a remodeling project at my house, total remodeling project. I'm struck by all of the contractors and their tradesmen, and everybody's been primarily Hispanic. All of them have two, three, or four-year-olds and such. It's made me realize that, well, first of all, I'm not proud to say this, how professional their trade is, how much they need to know, how much we have had to interface with the department of [inaudible 00:25:35] and safeties and such. Again, coming off the perception of blue collar, it's also reminded me of my dad, what he needed to know in his profession although he was blue collar. It's again, for me, closing the circle of life in terms of we're all the same and we just have different specialties, that a college degree doesn't mean I'm any better than anybody else. So it's been a huge wake-up call for me on a lot of different areas. It again makes me mad because I sometimes get frustrated with our people that we're not more activists. My sister totally issues, if you drive a car in Los Angeles, she's green peace everything. She does everything by the book.Alejandro: That must be really hard to do.Barbara: She totally does. But let me tell you in a kitty way. If she needs an emergency ride, she'd call me up even though I'm added to a carbon footprint for her and such. But on the other side, I really commend her, she's number six in the family, because she truly tries to live by her values and such. All 10 of us are successful in our respective careers, and she's just one who was a scholarship graduate of Stanford University. So I'd have to remind her at times, the younger members of the family didn't experience what us four older ones did, only speaking Spanish and not understanding. Because by that time, my parents totally had transitioned to English only in the house. By that time, when my dad died, the youngest three were 5, 6 and 7. So they didn't experience working in the factory, didn't experience a lot of growing up with the bi-cultural aspect. So for them, they really want to know the family history of the four oldest and what was it like to go on Sunday afternoons to our grandparents who they only spoke Spanish and such, because they'd missed on a huge chapter. So in my family, I feel like there's two huge families each growing up very differently.Alejandro: You've mentioned some really hard times, I imagine, being told that you were probably going to be held back in learning English. Are there any other really difficult moments in your life that you're experienced, maybe in your young adult phase in life, like just obstacles that you had to overcome because of being a Latina?Barbara: I don't really think so because I think the work ethic that both my parents had are working hard, and you don't ask any questions, you just observe, you just do the best you can, has been raised and why I've been successful. But on the other side, I've been reminded by this politically activist sister that I have, that I've been so programmed by Catholicism, so programmed by bureaucratic policies and procedures, so programmed by being the oldest in a family of 10, that I need to deprogram myself. I have to be honest with you right now as to what is my role, because both of my parents are now gone, as the eldest in the family. We had an episode a year ago with a brother who was taken to the hospital, and some members of the family did not find out until after two or three days later, and they were very upset. ""Barb, why didn't you call me?"" ""Wow. God, do I need to call all of you guys?"" Then it made me realize, yeah, I do have a leadership role in a way. So when the sister was recently involved in an accident a couple of weeks ago, I made a conscientious effort. I called everybody right down the line, the other eight brothers and sisters, sent then an e-mail after she was discharged from the hospital. But then again, you're caught as to what's programmed, what do you not program, what is your responsibility, am I the glue for the family, especially when I have a sister in Denver, a brother in Idaho, and everybody else is in different parts of the nation. So you start to wonder, what's your role? But yet, that's just me. So I'm still reconciling [00:30:00] as to that.Alejandro: Is there anything that you want people to know about just about Latinos in general? You've already talked about how we're hard working, we're educated, we care about education, we care about family and culture. What is it that you really want people to know? I'm just curious, honestly. I'm very selfish. I'm being very selfish right now. I really want to know because I do think that there is a bridging of cultures now in the 21st century.Barbara: I agree.Alejandro: But there's still a lot of work to do as far as education, especially in Los Angeles. But since you are an educator, what do you see basically? Where do you see Latinos in the United States in the next few years?Barbara: Where I see us is becoming more visible, absolutely, I credit a lot of that to our current president. I also feel that the school systems need to do a better job with our parents. I'm working with a young mother right now in West Covina, and she's a PTA president and she's an activist. But I'm recognizing that we have come power from when I started in this school district in 1969 to where we are today, and this is still the Los Angeles area. When she's telling me some of the things that are happening at her elementary school, and I really think the power is with the parents as I go to the dentist office and the hygienist is cleaning my teeth, and I see she's pregnant, and I'm recommending what books for her to read. ""Well, why would I read to my preschooler right now?"" Because she's having her second child, and I said, ""Excuse me?"" Well, she doesn't know how to read, so I'm thinking, ""Oh, my God. She's at a dentist office in Brentwood, and she is so young."" There's so much that has to be brought to the awareness of our young mothers having, just left the district, working in early education division for eight years, recognizing that our Mexican-American mothers primarily are graduates of only third grade. The highest educated mother is, as you know, Cubans. I'm thinking we have a lot of work to do in this nation yet for our young mothers to recognize the value of what they're doing. I know a lot of things are coming out of technology right now, as I hear, the statistics about young mothers of Latino students or children. They're primarily the largest women of color on Facebook, I'm thinking, ""Okay, there's hope,"" but we still have a lot and lot of work to do. That's primarily where I want to put my energies right now, even though I don't speak Spanish, is to help say to moms, you have a right to speak up, you can question, as one mother asked me recently about the school policy for uniforms at her son's school. I said, ""Let's look it up on the policy for your unified school district."" I print it out for her. I said, ""You have every right to go in there and question this and such."" But that's just a little piece of grain of sand. There's huge amount of work that still needs to happen in our nation.Alejandro: So one thing I also curious about since we do have a few minutes, was there a happy moment in your life when you did feel you made great strides, you talked about working with a civil rights for women, for example, is there anything that comes to mind like a really great achievement in your life that you would like to share?Barbara: I think the achievements would have been institutionalized in my family and in the district to know that I was in the bilingual office back in the '70s, and those practices, some of them are still been institutionalized at the state of California, to know I was in the school reform office in the '90s, and what we accomplished with staff selection there, which is now for Reno with the mayor is doing and such with these partnerships.Alejandro: Can you explain that a bit?MALE_1: Yeah. Well, what are those?Barbara: For instance, in the school reform office in the '90s, we were working with Mayor Riordan. So I smile right now when I hear about the charter schools, and when I hear about these schools of public choice, and I hear about the mayor's partnership and such. I just smile. I said, ""All of those things we were doing back in the '90s, they just were like the tips of the iceberg,"" and now that other external partners have come in, they're talking about staff selection of teachers. For instance, NPR this past Friday had the situation of Fremont High School on there. So when the superintendents talking about while the parents and the students are going to be able to select the teachers, I'm thinking, ""We did that back in '93, '94, this is no big shake."" But I realize, history takes time for everyone to hear it and for it to become institutionalized uniformly across the whole organization. [00:35:00] When I came into the district, the federal funds were just started. I was happy to leave the district where now early education now is an advocation for students and for the parents before kindergarten. Can't walk into a six hour classroom in kindergarten if you haven't had at least a three or four hour experiences as a pre-K student for the transformation. But again, a lot of our parents don't know that that is available to them in Los Angeles City Schools, and that's something there. Thank you.Alejandro: I'm sorry. Where you could offer, did you want to-Barbara: No, I'm finished. Thank you.Alejandro: Just to go back to your family a bit, who do you think was the biggest influence on you in your life?Barbara: Both my parents.Alejandro: Why or how? What did you learn from them?Barbara: Their work ethic, their values, they truly had shared values. I get emotional about this because I wish there were alive so I could thank them. Both of them were educators. People are still helping me because I have so many subscriptions to magazines, Newsweek, Time, I would have life, Saturday Evening Post, if it was still around. Still subscribed to the Los Angeles Times. My dad was an advocate reader. We grew up with tons of magazines in the '50s and '60s. That's why it was very moving for me to see these young families here today at the library. We always went to the library. That was a given. With my mom, she was an avid reader too. Catholicism, their view of tithing, their view of community service, and how humble they were. Again, when my mom died in 2004, how many community members came out? I didn't realize how much work she had done as a bilingual translator at the public school there in the community, besides just how the neighbors and the parishioners felt about her. To know that still, there's a mom of 10 kids around you in 2004, that's foreign to our young moms now. So I recognized what my parents gave us. I'm very eternally grateful for it because they gave us values that have really contributed to us. If I could digress for one moment, it was an example of where one of my brothers, unfortunately, was serving a weekend assignment, I hate to say, at County General for being picked up as a DUI, and when my mom and I were there to bail him amount, this is back in the '80s, I was really cognizant of the people who were being bailed out on that Sunday. I laid into him when he got in the car. I said, ""I know dad and mom did not work for us to end up here. They've given us so many opportunities, so many sacrifices."" But realizing that was the youngest brother, he was six when my dad died, he didn't know the sacrifices that my dad working three jobs in order to give us a Catholic school education and all of the opportunities that they did, and the sacrifices my mom made too, being a stay-at-home mom with the 10 of us. So I'm grateful for what they did. I know it was courageous on their part to live in a section of the city where people, as my mother would tell us, you don't ever leave this house without clean clothes because you will be labeled as a dirty Mexican. Now, my younger brothers and sisters don't know those kinds of stereotypes that were given to the oldest. So those are the things that I'm grateful for, that maybe how they did it could have been done differently, but what they did to make sure that we had the best opportunities were equal to everybody else in that community, I'm eternally grateful for. So thank you for this opportunity because I was really anxious to be part of this as you telling the story about all of us across the nation. When I say all of us, I'm not just talking Hispanics, but all of us as Americans.Alejandro: We are. Thank you so much. I know we have a few minutes left. Is there anything else you'd like to share?Barbara: No, unless you have any questions?Alejandro: Well, I figure we can go on forever,Barbara: I know. Because I know I do give long answers so I want to be respectful.Alejandro: No. I do want to say thank you for sharing your story.Barbara: Thank you.Alejandro: I think your parents are looking down and smiling.Barbara: Thank you.Alejandro: Actually, I am curious. Is your family still in Los Angeles, the majority of them?Barbara: About five of us are. One lives in the South Bay, West Los Angeles, San Demas, and Santa Monica, and then I'm in [00:40:00] the Palisades, and then two sisters in Northern California, a brother in central California, and then another brother in Idaho, and a sister and Denver. So I told them we just have to get the bases covered in Manhattan, they will be good.Alejandro: Well, if they hear this, do you have any words for them?Barbara: I'm happy that you've been part of history too. I don't think that you may realize what has gone on before you, and I'm not just talking in our family, all of the Mexicans, all of the Hispanics, all of the people of color in this nation, really actually everybody to make it a better nation. I'm proud of my brothers and sisters of what they've accomplished with their families too. So although we only have 12 nieces and nephews in a family of 10 brothers and sisters, everyone's been successful and contributing to making this nation and this world a better place, and I'm proud of you. Thank you.Alejandro: Thank you.Barbara: Thank you.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1
MBY006272,"Paul Yates: [00:00:00] My name is Paul Francis Sanchez Yates. I was born Paul Francis Sanchez IV. I'm 42 years old. Today's date is March 5th, 2010. We're in East Los Angeles. My friend John Ison, who I call Johnny Pisony, is my friend of 20 years.John Ison: This is John Ison. I'm 38 years old. Today is March 5th, 2010. We're in East LA. I am Paul Yates' friend of 20 years or so. I'll be interviewing him since I know him better than some.Paul Yates: We begin. Let's hope, this is going to the Library of Congress, I want to say something first. It's as we said, March 5th, 2010. We are in Los Angeles, and it's 3:47 PM. If time travel is ever invented, I'm sitting here right now, come get me. If I disappear right now, we know that time travel was invented, or they didn't bring this to the Library of Congress, one or the other. I just want to start with that because I want to always say that. If its ever invented, come pick me up. I feel like an alien on this planet, so come back and get me.John Ison: Paul, tell me about your childhood. Tell me where you grew up?Paul Yates: As I said, I was born Paul Francis Sanchez IV in Darien, Connecticut. Whenever I tell somebody that, I always say, ""And don't hold that against me,"" and I mean the Darien Connecticut part. My father is Spanish, Filipino, Hawaiian, American Indian, and English descent. But Sanchez and Darien means you're 100 percent Spanish. In Darien the eyes that upon you, are very white, and if you are any partial color, you're considered that. My mother and father divorced when I was two years old. Actually, he left. My mother had our birth certificates retroactively changed. So my birth certificate actually now says Paul Francis Yates, which was her maiden name. She would always tell her friends that if the father isn't going to be around to defend his Spanish heritage, I can't have them subject to the racism of Darien.John Ison: Right. You think part of it though was that it was a Hispanic name, like Sanchez, where she wanted to erase the Sanchez out of the system?Paul Yates: Yes. For some people it would feel like perhaps she was bitter towards him, but I don't think she was. She never spoke bitterly about him. She just wanted to make sure that my life was easiest in Darien, Connecticut. It wasn't ever going to be easy. I'm not very dark, but I'm darker than most people in Darien, and it still came out. People would sometimes accuse me of being every color, and every race, and make an epithet towards that. I also at a very early age, which we'll get to, I discovered punk rock when I was 10 years old in 1977. That made me an outsider, but also made me self-aware. Want to go back in time a little bit?John Ison: How old were you when your father left?Paul Yates: My father left sometime between when I was two and three. My brother was an infant. My brother was born a year and a half after me, and my father left soon after that. Now, my brother is a little whiter, he took after my mother. He has an upturned nose, he has very fair skin, he has blue eyes, straight black hair. You know my brother. Sometimes I said, well, he's the milk man's kid. He isn't, but he looks like my parents. He looks like a Yates. He is my mother's family's child. I don't think he had any much easier time than I did growing up in Darien.John Ison: He can pass.Paul Yates: He passes very well.John Ison: Yeah. If you were only two, do you have any memories of your father? Like early memories of your father?Paul Yates: I have three early childhood memories of him, and that's about it. I have this physical sense. I have a physical sense of this warm, darker man. I was probably bathing or showering with him. I remember calling him dad and I remember this warm man. I remember he painted, I think he painted the characters from Sesame Street on our bathroom wall literally when I was two years old.Then there's this story of [00:05:00] beep, beep girls, and I think that's the beginning of the end of my father and mother's relationship. I had been out driving with my father, he would take me on drives a lot because I was very colicky when I was little. I think I screamed and yelled for the first couple of years of my life, and driving would calm me down. I would come back to the house, and this is the story that's been told to me now, saying this weird little phrase, which was, ""Beep, beep girls."" My mother figured out that my father was driving around beeping at girls. Then my father was in a car accident and my mother went and got him out of the hospital. But the next day on the cover of our local paper, there was a photograph taken of that accident at the time of the accident, and my father was in the car with another woman, which he neglected to mention when my mum picked him up at the hospital.John Ison: He was literally exposed on the front page of the paper?Paul Yates: Yes.John Ison: That's very funny.Paul Yates: My great grandmother was American Indian. She was an Iroquoian Indian, and she would tell me of times of the racism in Darien from her. When she was a child in Darien, people would drive by their house and fire bullets into the house and scream, ""Indian, go home."" It's ironic to me. They've always come from this interesting odd place. I actually loved being an outsider in Darien. I don't speak Spanish, I'm very fair-skinned, I pass. Spanish people don't think I'm Spanish. Spanish people think I'm Asian sometimes, or preppy and white.John Ison: Right. Well, what kind of town is Darien? Where is it?Paul Yates: Well, Darien is in the Gold Coast of Connecticut. Half your listeners are probably from Darien, the other half are voting Republican. How do I describe Darien? Help me describe Darien.John Ison: Darien is like the town that Lucy moved to, and I love Lucy.Paul Yates: Right. Darien is the town. I mean, she moved to Westport, which is the neighboring town. My childhood in Darien is the Ice storm, the movie, the book by Rick Moody.John Ison: Today, Martha Stewart lives around the corner or something, right?Paul Yates: Yes. Darien is a white community. There was one indigenous black family in Darien when I grew up, and we were their neighbor, which is cool, at least to me. We would take the bus together, and that family was called the Littles, and we would take the bus together. Bus rides are always hell for anybody who's weird or outside. But there was a bunch of kids who would chant the word ''nigger'' from the back to the front of the bus to this poor girl. It was just awful. When I was nine or 10, my hair went from being blonde to being dark brown and extremely curly, and the same thing started to be chanted about me. It was just really odd because also in Darien, it got this false sense of couth, of manners. It's beneath anyone. If you're a racist, you're not going to show it, but the children of those people are going to show it, and the children on the buses don't have that same sense of manner and pride and primness. It was just a very interesting, scary place to be.John Ison: So you always felt like an outsider in this community?Paul Yates: Yeah, and I like that. I mean, it feels like a badge of honor that I was an outsider in that community. But I'm also an outsider in Spanish community, I'm an outsider in the American Indian community, I'm an outsider in the Hawaiian community, but the feeling of alienation doesn't continue to this day. I feel like I'm me. I'm an alien on this planet. I'm not an alien in any culture, I'm an alien on Earth.John Ison: Right. I think you've self-embraced that. You like being an outsider.Paul Yates: I do. Because of that, my ego had to form early, my sense of self had to form early. Let's get back to Darien for a second. I grew up with a mother and a little brother, single-parent in Darien. This was at a time when single parenting started. I was a latchkey kid and I would come home at 3:30 from school and call my mom at work. She was a dental hygienist for a while. I would say, ""I'm home,"" and she be like, ''Okay, I'll be home in [00:10:00] three hours. Make sure your brother gets home okay, and don't set the house on fire."" Then my mother became a secretary at an advertising company. Then my mother became president of an advertising company, her own. She went from poor single parent to meteoric, Darien, Madison Avenue advertising agent. Then she started drinking. I had this tiny little family unit. We were a little bit outside in Darien, but we were happy. But then when I was about 15, she was about 35, the martini lunches got to her. Trying to live up to this Madison Avenue life got to her. She started drinking and within the course of a year, she disappeared and I was homeless. So I was once again an outsider in Darien in that I was homeless. She left our house. She tried to stab me, as you know, and disappeared. That's the story? Should I tell the story of the stabbing?John Ison: Yeah. I mean, my family life was always so stable. So when you talk about your mother, you talk about her as being a really wonderful woman one minute, it seems like to me, and then the next minute she became this horrible alcoholic. What happened? I mean, you were a kid. What did you see? What do you remember when this happened?Paul Yates: Like I said, I grew up in this tiny, little family unit, and we were a little people. Actually coincidentally, we rented the smallest livable house in Darien, Connecticut. It was there when Darien was founded as a town. It was this old colonial house. It only had four rooms and the downstairs only had 5.5-foot high ceilings. My brother and my mom and I could I'll stand in there, but any friends or relatives that would come over had to duck when they were in the kitchen or her bedroom. Upstairs was my bedroom, a living room, and my brother's room, which was a closet. He lived in a closet, so it had this gable going down the middle of it. So he couldn't raise his feet while he slept. It was a very nurturing, beautiful environment.Then she started becoming the American dream. She went from coming home at 6:30 to not coming home because she had meetings, to having to go on trips. She actually worked on Reagan's, maybe that's why she become an alcoholic, she worked on Reagan's campaign. She actually came up with a slogan for him that helped him get elected called, ""Say something good about America."" She started drinking, and she start drinking a lot. She wanted to keep up with the other guys. She went from martini's to Jack Daniel's. If I saw her at lunchtime, she'd already had a couple of drinks. She would be able to drink a bottle of Jack Daniel's in a couple of days, that would be in the house. It was just becoming this strange thing, but then all of a sudden, her personality changed from nurturing to odd and different and scary.I confronted her at some point. My little punk rock 15-year-old self was like, ""Mom, I think you're drinking too much. I don't know why I'm saying this, but it seems like it."" It immediately we became enemies. She hated me for saying that, and she told her boyfriend that I tried to hurt her. She was this different person. It was as if she were possessed. I always look it like The Exorcist, as a parable to alcoholism. Who cares about the Christian overtone of that movie? It is a parable. Because my mom was not there anymore. I have two mothers: I have this great, nurturing, young beautiful thing and this woman who tried to kill me.It got to the point where she lost her job. She stopped going to work. Now, she had a giant bank account, which I had a couple bunch of checks too. So I would write checks for food at the local grocery store. My brother and I would go cash it and then go get a ton of basically frozen food and we'd just put in the microwave and heat it. She started not coming home anymore. She literally stopped coming home for days, and we were like, ""What is going on?"" We had an above-ground pool, which is also outside for Darien because as you know, Darien has in ground pools. But my mom drove her new Mustang directly into it. So she parked in the pool. My brother came running in, ""My mom just drove into the pool,"" and by that point I was like, yeah, I'm over this. I already know. She's like everybody else in Darien, she's an alcoholic. She's awful, which is telling.One night, my brother and I were making Eggos. It was easy to make frozen food. My mother was home, [00:15:00] but at this point, she was a ghost. She was in her bed most of the time. She was roaming the house at all different times of night. She was smoking and she was just drunk. She was this odd ghost. My brother and I were just joking to each other, we instantly developed a bond and a macabre sense of humor about it, about the world. My mom came out of the bedroom and told us to shut up. We laughed at her because at that point, we didn't consider her our mother anymore, or at least the mother that raised us, it was this other person. So we said, ""Go to bed. Please don't bother us, mom."".A minute later she came out with a knife and she's started coming at me with a knife and she said, ""I'll tell you kids to shut up or I'll show you how to shut up."" She was coming at me in slow motion. That's the only way I remember it. She came at me pointing a knife right at my chest. Remember, our house is tiny, so from her bedroom to me was probably six steps. My brother was looking at me, he was standing by the toaster and I'm standing by the freezer and she's coming at me with a knife pointed right at my chest. I couldn't believe it. This was not my mother, this was not happening. I guess I was in a sense of denial, but it didn't feel like I was denying it, I just didn't believe it. I know that's the same thing. But it was real. I was like, ""Wow, that is weird. That knife is going into my chest in a second."" My brother screamed and I turned to him and then looked down at the knife and then it'll all coalesced. It was real. I stepped back and kicked her hand and she dropped the knife and ran to her car and drove away. My brother looked at me and he was like, ""What just happened?"".That night, the police were called. My mother came back and said that I tried to stab her with a knife. They didn't believe her, they knew what was going on. They actually knew her. They knew her from being good and they knew her from being bad. They had a sense of her at this point. They took my brother and I out of the house. They actually took us to Che Che's, which is a fast-food, sit-down, family restaurant, Mexican at that time and bought us dinner, it was really nice of them, and then drop us off at our grandmother's house who lived in a tiny apartment. The next day I took my mother to court. I had been advised that if I took her to court and charged her with attempted murder or attempted assault or whatever it was that she would get enforced help. The judge said, ""You can go to some dry out place or you could go to jail."" So she took being dried out. My brother went to go live with my grandmother and I lived in this empty house. That week I also became an emancipated adult. It was just when I was 16. So I became an emancipated adult. My mother returned two months later from good behavior or whatever, and was not good, she was still an alcoholic, and my house fell apart at that point. There was nothing left to it. There was no heat, there was no electricity. I was living in basically an empty house with a dangerous mother. So I lived on the street, I lived in abandoned buildings, I lived in the train station. I lived at friends houses, of course, you go from friend to friend to friend. But at that point people weren't as aware of alcoholism, so my family didn't believe my mother was an alcoholic, and my friend's parents got sick of me being there. Which they would, if they didn't want to take in a kid. Let me be clear, I was a really good kid. I've never had a drink of alcohol, I've never had any drug whatsoever except for antibiotics, aspirin, and coffee.John Ison: Right. Is that because you saw your mother, so you decided, ""I can't become that""?Paul Yates: Everybody says that. Everybody says that must be the reason. But in Darien, people smoke pot when they're 10. People are already having ram cokes at fourth grade birthday parties, which is why they're all alcoholics and why it's permissible, at least at that point, and I already saw it. Now, my mother's father was an alcoholic. He was sober when I was a boy, but when she was a girl, he was an alcoholic. She had six brothers and sisters, he would beat them, he would get drunk. He was an Irish American, second-generation, Darien, wrong side of the tracks, wanting to be on the right side of the tracks, whatever that means, made a lot of money and beat his seven children with a rifle. He would beat them with a Rifle. That's the story of my grandfather, who's still alive, by the way. My mother's dead, my grandparents are dead except for him. My father is still alive, which we'll get to. So we'll go through homeless. Are you all right with this story?MALE_1: [00:20:00] Yeah. We have 20 minutes.Paul Yates: We have 20 minutes. Wow. Goodness.John Ison: Okay. So your mother's crazy and an alcoholic, did anybody take her place?Paul Yates: At that time, no. She had had a boyfriend for 10 years, a really sweet boyfriend. His name was Fred.John Ison: But even not just as a mother, but just as somebody who was this influence on you or somebody who was a paternal-maternal figure.Paul Yates: I wouldn't say a paternal, but had an avuncular figure. I had my uncle Jerry. My uncle Jerry was a filmmaker. When I was 10, he came back from California, moved to New York. He was a punk rocker and a filmmaker, and I instantly became his protege. When I was 10 years old, I had a 16-millimeter movie camera. He and I would go out, and I would be the brunt or I'd be the star of all his films. But I say the brunt because he would say, ""Okay, now I'm going to start filming and I want you to run into traffic. Do not get hit, but don't stop running until I say cut."" Things like that or, ""I want you to climb this electrical wire. Don't touch the tree and the wire at the same time. But if you're just hanging from the wire, you will not get electrocuted. So jump to it when you grab it."".I actually loved that. I sat by his side for years and watched him make films. I just graduated from the American Film Institute. I went to New York University by the way for photography, and I went to SUNY Purchase for film. All of them say you can't teach film making, you can only learn it, and I learned it at his side. He recently died of lung cancer. My uncle Jerry, Jerry Yates was a really beautiful experimental punk rock filmmaker from the early '80s. He also went crazy. I mean, he had drug addiction when he was young and later on it caught up with him. You're saying did anything spur my mother. I think that she had all these terrible influences from her childhood, but when we were little kids she had to take care of us. Those demons couldn't overtake her. As we got older, just at the point where I could take care of myself, strangely, the demons took her. I think that in a weird way she held out until we could take care of ourselves, or at least to a point. Trust me my brother and I are scarred from this. But in a weird way we're pretty good. I'm an alien and my brother is really funny. He's an interesting, smart weirdo.John Ison: Did you guys form a special bond or anything like that? Do you feel like you have this closeness to your brother because of what the two of you went through?Paul Yates: Yes. But also I think because we were so nurtured. We were regular brother and brother when we were kids. We fought and we built tree forts. I didn't want him around because he was younger, and I loved him. I introduced him to music. The only two bands he likes on Earth are the two bands I gave him when he was 10, which are Devo and Kraftwerk. I think he's added Bjork, and that's it. That's all my brother likes. It's really funny.John Ison: What happened when you saw Empire Strikes Back before him?Paul Yates: Oh, my gosh. You're going to make me tell this story. So I am a normal, regular older brother. In 1980, when the movie The Empire Strikes Back came out. Now, of course we all loved Star Wars. I went to go see it opening night in Stamford, Connecticut and came back. One of my friend's father's took all of us go see it and I knew what had happened, I knew the story. I'd seen the movie, my brother had not yet been able to see it, he was going to see it on the weekend with my mom. I walked upstairs to his closet and I opened the door and I said, ""Brandon, I just saw The Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father."" I turned around and started walking to my bedroom. As his anger built, I could feel it building and it was sinking in and his rage started. He couldn't take it. He stood up and started to scream and run at me. But just as I timed it, I turn and closed my bedroom door and locked it. Hearing his pounding and screaming. I think I was grounded for that.John Ison: Did he ever forgive you?Paul Yates: No, he's still hasn't forgiven me. Every time he sees a movie that I mention I want to see before I see it he tells me the ending, so I don't tell him anymore. But this has been for years. If I say, ""I want to see Avatar right now,"" he'd say, ""The blue people win."" He'll tell me immediately.John Ison: In high school, you've mentioned being a punk rocker and obviously you had a rocky time in high school.Paul Yates: Yes.John Ison: That was about the time that your mother was going through all this?Paul Yates: Yes. Again, my mother disappeared sometime in my junior year.John Ison: So did you [00:25:00] actually graduate from Darien High School or not?Paul Yates: I did not. It's all different now, I hope. Teachers are under mandate to help a student who asked for help. Like I said, I was this smart, weird, straightedge kid and I went to the school and said, ""My mom is an alcoholic. She's not living in our house anymore. I want to go to school, but I have a lot of time having to feed my little brother and take him to his private school."" So I would drive him to his private school in my mom's car, drop it back off at home and walk to Darien High because I wasn't allowed to take a car, but if it was there I would.John Ison: Who's paying for your brother's private school?Paul Yates: My mother's check book was still paying for his private school. There was a big bank account at one point which in a year was gone. So I went to school and I said please help me. They said you should see the school counselor, I told him the whole story. Then they said you should see the school of psychiatrist, so I told him the whole story. Then they said you should see the vice principal, and he said, ""We'd like you to leave the school. Here's a piece of paper, sign it.""John Ison: Like we want you to drop out?Paul Yates: Yes. We want you to drop out of school.John Ison: What is there?Paul Yates: Well, that's an interesting thing because I don't know. I would say I was too messed up, but I wasn't messed up mentally, I was messed up emotionally. Again, I wasn't dangerous, I wasn't being weird, I just wasn't able to attend school regularly. I needed help, but they said it would be better for you just to go and get a job. You're already an emancipated adult, so just go get a job. Later on I found out that probably wasn't kosher but.John Ison: Or legal.Paul Yates: Yeah, I know. But now they'd have to fix that, they'd have to actually help me. But I sign the paper I was like, ""Great I'm out of here. School sucks.""John Ison: It's like they just burned down the school for you.Paul Yates: Yeah, thank you. Strangely enough, I was already accepted to New York University. So I just had to go get my GED and then survive the next eight months before NYU started. Then when I went to NYU I had no place to stay either. I lived in the dark room because I was a photography student until that became overwhelming for me and I just dropped out of NYU.John Ison: I know that you act it out at Darien High School at one point in a symbolic display.Paul Yates: Yes. Now, this was not related to me being thrown out because actually they thought it was cool. But I crucified myself on the front of the school. Are you happy? I built a 14 foot cross in wood shop. This is 1983 and I was in torn jeans with the clash spray painted on the side, wearing like a Smith's t-shirt and boots and a leather jacket. I built a 14 foot cross in a wood shop, dragged it through every main part of the school where everyone meets to the cafeteria. People throw food at me. I dragged it through the office, put it up in front of the school on the sign that's said Darien High and I went up there while my friends photographed it. I tried to get it as the yearbook picture and they pulled it.MALE_1: Can I ask a question?.Paul Yates: Yes.MALE_1: Paul, you had a very traumatizing adolescence, how did you deal with it? You seem normal enough to me.Paul Yates: The reason why I survived my childhood was because my mom was so nurturing and because I was a punk rocker. Strangely, it was so self empowering. It was a do-it-yourself; reject, assess, accept. Reject what's given to you on the surface, assess it for what it really means, and then accept it only if it really is valid. That philosophy has lasted my whole life. Although I dropped out of NYU, I quickly got a job selling cameras. Then I reapplied to school at the State University of New York at Purchase, which was one of the hippest underground film schools in America. I went straight through that. Because I was homeless which I could finally prove, it's not easy to prove you're homeless, but once I proved it they paid for me and gave me a stipend, and I lived there. So for four years I had a stable home. Then right after that I had a childhood friend named Moby, who I grew up with and went to Darien High together. We'd become best friends and made some movies together, some short films. He said, ""I'm doing this weird thing, I'm playing techno music all over Europe would you like to come with me? I need someone to play keyboards."" Because it's me with a tape machine and a microphone and I need somebody to play keyboard, so it looks like I'm an act. We toured Europe for a couple of years together. That was an interesting, stable time even though we were in a bus, a plane, a hotel every single day. At that time, since I'd become so entrenched in the music community, I was asked to shoot the preeminent documentary about the history of techno music called [00:30:00] Modulations, which was a big film festival hit. It also got a big release. It was a Sundance, Berlin, Cuba giant. We were the first history of electronic music/techno documentary that had ever been made. Now we're going fast because we're running out of time.MALE_1: Ten minutes.John Ison: Okay, that's fine.Paul Yates: Okay. Ten minutes.John Ison: Now you're an artist. I think the most important thing to you, in my opinion, from what I see, is the fact that you are an artist. You make films, you take pictures, you write.Paul Yates: I'm also a German electronic musician.John Ison: Name, Schaumgummi.Paul Yates: Yes, I have a alternate personality that's had two hits in Germany where I sing in German. Now, I only know enough German to sing the songs that I sing, but they've had to charted dance hits from my weird personality named Schaumgummi, which literally means form rubber, but sometimes Germans think it means marshmallow, and I sing about marshmallows and know is a slime.John Ison: Like you said, you and your uncle Jerry were making movies when you were a teenager.Paul Yates: Right.John Ison: Do you think that has been your way of dealing with these external traumas like your mother's alcoholism, your father abandoning the family, etc.?Paul Yates: I do think that making films is some therapy for me, but I don't use it as that. I do it, I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, but I'll make a film and then I'll say, ""That's about alcoholism."" But I didn't intend it to be that way. I'd like to now, but I rarely want to make a polemic. I just want to make a film, and the film is usually really seriously entrenched in surrealism, or my personal story about me and my feelings, not about my hurt or my childhood or anything like that.John Ison: Right. Now, your father left the house when you were two, what was the next time you saw him?Paul Yates: My father left when I was two, 22 years later, I took a movie camera, now this is a movie camera, not a video camera. So a movie camera with lots of film and an external microphone and external recording device, and I drove to Massachusetts where he lives. Outside of Massachusetts, just in New Hampshire.John Ison: But how did you find him? You literally hadn't heard a word from him in 23 years or whatever. How did you find him?Paul Yates: I found him by looking through the microfilm of every phone book in the United States. Back then they didn't have computers.John Ison: You didn't Google somebody.Paul Yates: Right. There was no real Internet. So I had to go to the library in Darien, Connecticut, and look through the microfilm of every Sanchez. But his name is very specific, it's Paul Francis Sanchez III. So I found two of them in the United States and I sent them both a package. In that package I had a couple of films that I had made, 10 photographs, and a tape of music, and a tape of my favorite songs. So I was like, here's this guy, your son. Now, I never missed him. I never felt like I missed him. It's like, do you miss your third arm? My mom didn't really worry about him, I didn't really ever worry about him, and until she went crazy, I didn't need him. So I send out these packages, and then my grandmother, his mother, contacted me six months later saying, I got a letter from your father. Now, he said he never received the package, but it's too coincidental, the time is too close. I called him on the phone and we spoke for half an hour, very nervously, and I said, look, can I come up next week and shoot a couple of pictures? Now, I actually meant, can I film you? But I said shoot a couple of pictures, whatever. So I brought this giant movie camera, and drove to his house, and knocked on his door, and filmed him for a day, and made a documentary out of it. I think that's the first film you ever saw that I made. I think you came to SUNY Purchase when it was premiering it and saw it.John Ison: Could be.Paul Yates: Now, I make these art films, and I try to make these surreal, beautiful, grace-filled films, and everyone is like, ""That documentary you made of your father is the best thing you ever made.""John Ison: It's true. Something about seeing these two people meet each other for the first time, almost, in their lives, and they have this, what most people think of as the closest relationship you can have, a parent and a son. To see that happen, it's just like you find out more about you and more about your father in those 20 minutes than you could in a lifetime of painting pictures or writing poems or whatever. For some reason, it's like the truth comes out because it is [00:35:00] just the most awkward position two people could be in. Something about that is just amazing to watch.Paul Yates: Thanks. I think so too. I could go film your father today or you could go film your father today, and you might have him on an off day. He might just be distracted, he might not give you everything. Although my father was never there my whole life, I can watch this film again and know exactly who he is. It's a beautiful thing. Every time I re-watch it I'm like, ""Wow, that's that guy. That's my father."" I only saw ever one time after that. You were there.John Ison: I was there. We had lunch with him. He was the same guy, but he was a little bit more humble I remember. But it was interesting to meet that man in person.Paul Yates: The funny thing is that you talked to him the whole time. He'd rather talk to you at that lunch than to me. He talked to you about football or something.John Ison: He could relate to me more than he could relate to you. But I felt part of that was he knew what he had done to you and your family, or maybe he didn't do anything because it probably wasn't as big a deal to you as it was to him, but he had this lingering guilt over it. So that was always going to be there whenever you two are together, which was very rarely. It feels like the reason you never saw him was he felt guilty and he didn't want to face that guilt. He just wanted to go and hide and leave and forget about it.Paul Yates: There's a Kurt Vonnegut story, it's about a man who can play the most beautiful jazz music on a piano, but he doesn't tell his family. He has a wife and kid and they're poor and they live threadbare. But there was a man who was investigating his money and they find out that he's a millionaire, and they want to tell him you're a millionaire. They tell him and he says, ""Okay, but don't tell my wife because they'll just spend the money. They'll just become worse people."" But then this guy gets all intrigued and goes and follows this guy and sees that two towns away from his family, he's this amazing jazz pianist. He's the best in the world and he doesn't share it with his wife and kid. He's a little embarrassed that he has this talent and he doesn't want his wife and kid to become famous or be a part of that world, they just want to live very spartanly. I always thought, wow, that's my father. That's that guy. I'm going to meet him and he's going to be a superhero. The reason why he had to leave is because he's a superhero, he didn't want to get us in trouble. He didn't want the villains to get us. He's embarrassed at his talents. But what comes through on the film is that he's a shlub. But I'm actually glad because having grown up without him, my mom's choice to not have him there, I would either be more like him, shlub, or I would have to defend myself against being like him, which I have to do about my mom anyway. So I'm glad that I just have one good and bad parent to deal with instead of two.John Ison: Exactly. You weren't missing anything. It's like, well, he's just another asshole. So I'm not missing anything.Paul Yates: That's right.John Ison: Anyway, we're almost done here I guess. Now, today, you want to make movies.Paul Yates: Yes. I've made movies my whole life. It's weird to say that in Hollywood because now I live in Los Angeles, and I just recently graduated from the American Film Institute. I moved there because it was the scariest thing for me to do. I wanted to go to graduate school to learn more about the master directors and about master director techniques, and I'm pretty good. I'm a pretty good self-taught filmmaker, but there are some master techniques that you want to learn about. You want to learn about Bresson's technique, you want to learn about dryer, you want to learn about Hitchcock's techniques that you can just say, he does X, Y, and Z, and that's how he gets that information across. So it was the scariest thing to move to Hollywood and go to school in Hollywood, and go to the elite American Institute to learn about that. I did, and it's weird because I can say to somebody, ""I've been making films my whole life."" We just talked about my father's film for 20 minutes. But if you talk to somebody in Los Angeles, if you haven't made a current feature-John Ison: If you haven't made my best friend's wedding, you're not a filmmaker. You consider yourself a filmmaker and you're not a young man anymore, is it like, well, I don't care about that attitude. I'm a filmmaker, I'm making my own movies. Is that what keeps you going or do you still feel like you haven't achieved that thing that you've wanted to achieve?Paul Yates: Well, it's funny because while at the American Film Institute, I wrote a picaresque. What is it called? A Bildungsroman. I wrote a story about a mixed-race teen in white-bred Connecticut, who grows up with an alcoholic mother and becomes homeless, and has these negligent weirdo uncles and almost childlike parent figures who don't live up to being a parent. So he has to discover [00:40:00] himself. The Film Institute considers it one of the three-best written scripts they've ever had, and they'll tell you that if you call them, which is cool except now that I sound like Quentin Tarantino. But the weird thing is that I bring it to producers, the Film Institute says, here's the script, everyone read it, and every single producer says, can you make the lead actor all white? Because then we can make this film. We can get money to make it because we can't have a half-race character in a film. No one wants to see that. I'm like, well, now I have to apologize for being Spanish and Arianne, and I have to apologize for being of mixed race in Hollywood. It's like the same thing all over again. I move to the same place, which is really weird. Although Hollywood is more accepting, but not of the lead character.John Ison: Ironically, we look out the window and everybody walking down the street is of a different race.Paul Yates: Hell, yes. I feel that my race, like I said, I'm this mixed-race character. I think my race is closer to the face of America right now, race-wise, than Tom Cruise.John Ison: Well, you call it a melting pot, you're melted. A lot of things melted.Paul Yates: I'd rather see a film starring me or someone who looks like me than someone who is white. I've seen all the white stories and I think they're wonderful, but now I want to see a mixed-race story. There are some being made, but now it's my turn to say it.John Ison: So you don't want to make my best friend's wedding, you want to make that movie.Paul Yates: Yeah. I want to make Paul Yates's wedding. Paul Francis Sanchez Yates, the wedding.John Ison: Speaking with, you just got engaged.Paul Yates: Yes, I did.John Ison: Would you like to tell America about your lovely wife? Your lovely fiance, who she is?Paul Yates: I'm engaged to your ex girlfriend, her name is Rebecca Tal, and she's very cool. She is also a mixed race. She's Jewish, and American-Indian, and she comes from a long line of artists. Her grandfather was a beat poet and a beat writer at a hobo, and a photographer.John Ison: He knew Charles Bukowski?Paul Yates: He knew Charles Bukowski well. All the photographs of Charles Bukowski you've ever seen, he took. Her mother started, strangely enough, which is probably why I'm marrying her, her mother started Beyond Shelter which gives homeless families permanent shelter.John Ison: And Para Los Ninos.Paul Yates: And Para Los Ninos, which is also putting children into homes, putting homeless families into homes. Funny enough I needed to marry that.John Ison: Well, you were homeless, and now she'll give you a home, I guess.Paul Yates: Exactly. I hope you don't hold it against me that I'm marrying your ex girlfriend.John Ison: We'll see.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

About Myspace and all of that.Jenny:	It's vague, I just remember talking to you a lot, and I don't remember whether Yahoo or anything, because I remember we used to IM a lot and then I don't know. Did you ask me do you want to meet? I don't even remember that.Noel:	I think I did, and then you're like, ""No, because you could be some old guy or something.""Jenny:	Yeah. I was like, ""Whoa, I don't think so."" I don't know. Yeah, I remember it. Because Claudia told me that she knew who you were. I was like, ""Well, how old is he?"" and whatever. He's 15 right now. I was like, ""Okay, should I meet him?"" Like, ""Yeah, just meet him.""Noel:	2006?Jenny:	Yeah, '06.Noel:	Back in the days.Jenny:	A while back.Noel:	Remember all those times we went to Martin Luther King Park. Jenny:	Shut up.Noel:	It's crazy.Jenny:	You know the first memory that pops up? The stupid gum.Noel:	The gum? You don't want to give me the gum.Jenny:	Shut up.Noel:	You ended up swallowing it.Jenny:	Shut up. It was an accident because you pushed me.Noel:	No. Well, you swallowed it though.Jenny:	Whatever.Noel:	That was funny.Jenny:	Whatever. I don't know. Whatever.Noel:	What [00:05:00] else comes into mind?Jenny:	About back then?Noel:	Yeah, back then.Jenny:	The juicy drinks.Noel:	Which one?Jenny:	I used to go to the doughnut shop a lot, Juicy something. Big Juicy.Noel:	Big Juicy.Jenny:	I used to love drinking that. It was all the time. That's what comes to the mind.Noel:	I guess. Man, remember we went to a park again and they changed it.Jenny:	Recently, yeah.Noel:	They changed it.Jenny:	Yeah, I know.Noel:	They took off the playground and everything to put swings.Jenny:	They put it different.Noel:	Remember the swing I asked you out too?Jenny:	Yes.Noel:	It's not there.Jenny:	I remember that.Noel:	Now it's a basketball court. It's crazy. This is our second time.Jenny:	Yes, I know it's our second time. What do you think is different?Noel:	What?Jenny:	What do you think is different?Noel:	Probably our attitudes.Jenny:	Like how?Noel:	We were young.Jenny:	We still are young.Noel:	You barely started dating and you just want to date as many people as you want.Jenny:	I didn't want to date as many people. Well, not really.Noel:	You still did though.Jenny:	Shut up.Noel:	Remember I even got permission from your dad.Jenny:	Permission? What do you mean permission?Noel:	Permission to go out with you. Yeah, I did.Jenny:	No.Noel:	You don't remember that afternoon we sat down in the sofa.Jenny:	I remember that but you didn't ask permission, you were just talking to him. He still wants to talk to you.Noel:	What?Jenny:	He still wants to talk to you. I was like, ""No, what do you want to talk to him for? You already talked to him."" You still want to talk to him?Noel:	Maybe.Jenny:	I don't know. Because he said a lot that you should ask permission to go out with me or something.Noel:	Yeah. I should probably do it today.Jenny:	My brother said that he wants to have some sort of dinner with you or I don't know, something like that.Noel:	Dinner with me?Jenny:	Not dinner, but to go out and eat together. So you could know each other more like this, sit down and talk. He said maybe go to an arcade or play something. Street Fighter, let's [inaudible 00:07:53] it.Noel:	Tell him I'll go to Huntington Park, the little pool thing. The arcade underground. Huntington Park.Jenny:	No, I don't know it.Noel:	No, you don't know?Jenny:	No.Noel:	It's this little underground arcade where you could play pool.Jenny:	Really? That's crazy. I'm just kidding. What do you think makes us such good friends?Noel:	Maybe the part that you trust me and I trust you.Jenny:	How did you think that happened?Noel:	Probably like time, I think.Jenny:	I remember back then I had a hard shell. I didn't want to let you in.Noel:	What about now?Jenny:	What do you mean? Do I trust you?Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	Yeah. Duh, I even tell you personal stuff.Noel:	Personal stuff like really personal?Jenny:	Yes.Noel:	You don't want me telling them?Jenny:	No.Noel:	No, okay. You're saying I'm not allowed.Jenny:	It's too personal.Noel:	It's too personal. No, we're coming back from, what was it, [inaudible 00:09:11] ?Jenny:	Shut up. I almost like you.Noel:	What happened there?Jenny:	God, I swear. Anywhos, do you think that we'll loose distance between? Not something like that, like get distant?Noel:	I don't know. Well, I'll still come back. I'm going to Humboldt.Jenny:	I know you are.Noel:	I'm still coming back though. Hopefully, you're not in UC Davis or something.Jenny:	You know I want to go to Pepperdine.Noel:	What happened to UC Davis?Jenny:	I don't know. It's too rural, or however you say it.Noel:	[00:10:00] Rural?Jenny:	Rural, whatever. I can't say it.Noel:	How come you don't want to go to [inaudible 00:10:13] ?Jenny:	Well, it's not that I don't want to, it's just that I haven't really researched it. I just know that letter that they sent me that it's surrounded by nature and away from the city and stuff like that. There is something about activists or some symbol or something like that.Noel:	Okay.Jenny:	Why do you want to go?Noel:	I don't know. It looked like a really nice university.Jenny:	Have you researched any others?Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	Like?Noel:	Like Santa Barbara. I'm waiting for them to tell me if I have been admitted. UC Davis, UCLA.Jenny:	UCLA?Noel:	Yeah, I applied to UCLA.Jenny:	Really?Noel:	Remember?Jenny:	I didn't know that.Noel:	You told me to apply to four UCs.Jenny:	Oh, yeah. I just forgot.Noel:	At least you got the opportunity to research them.Jenny:	Yeah, I'm starting early and stuff. I have to apply to six scholarships by June.Noel:	You have to apply already?Jenny:	Uh-huh.Noel:	Damn.Jenny:	I know, right?Noel:	Is it a requirement in your school?Jenny:	It's a requirement. Because they know I don't graduate. I mean, not graduate, I get an F in advisory.Noel:	You need to tell me what school you go to.Jenny:	I go to Gertz-Ressler High School.Noel:	Where is it located?Jenny:	110 Freeway.Noel:	Mine isn't better.Jenny:	Yours is where?Noel:	Animo Justice Charter High School. It's at 27th in Long Beach, right next to the train track.Jenny:	Yeah, I visited there.Noel:	Yeah?Jenny:	It looks pretty big though.Noel:	It's not big.Jenny:	Just that the campus is just small.Noel:	We have two schools in there. The Ralph Bunche has the topper, the second floor, we got this.Jenny:	You're in the [inaudible 00:12:16] , right?Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	What else?Noel:	I do [inaudible 00:12:19] downstairs now.Jenny:	Inside or outdoors?Noel:	Inside. Yeah. Outdoors attracts to much attention.Jenny:	Excuse me.Noel:	You're excused.Jenny:	Thank you. It's really sweet of you, honestly.Noel:	Sweet and short. No, short and sweet.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	Remember that?Jenny:	Yeah, I know. They keep on saying that, like, ""Oh, the theater workshop."" They're like, ""Oh, it's the positive attributes about you. My junior, whatever her name is, she was like, ""Oh, you're short and sweet over there."" That's the first thing that pops up in their head.Noel:	Well, I guess it was a punchline.Jenny:	It was.Noel:	I guess you're right, right timing.Jenny:	But I'm not that short.Noel:	I'm 5'3"".Jenny:	I'm 5'4"".Noel:	Okay.Jenny:	I'm just kidding. I don't know, I forgot. I think I'm 5'4"".Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	I don't know, 5'3"" or 5'4"".Noel:	You're a bit taller than me. Does the height in any way make you uncomfortable?Jenny:	No.Noel:	No?Jenny:	Uh-uh. As long as it's not like a-Noel:	Whole feet taller.Jenny:	Yeah, like a whole feet, yeah.Noel:	Imagine that.Jenny:	I'm like, ""Yeah, I got to go.""Noel:	I have to step on your toes just to kiss you.Jenny:	No. I don't really like that. I don't know, I'm kind of shallow. Sorry.Noel:	Oh, damn.Jenny:	I got to be growing while I'm still young.Noel:	Got to drink a lot of milk.Jenny:	Yeah. I don't drink milk. I don't like milk.Noel:	Why not?Jenny:	Because when I was little, I used to throw up a lot.Noel:	Yeah?Jenny:	I remember I was [inaudible 00:14:01] normally, and I would drink milk because my mom gave it to and it was warm. Then at night, I would just wake up and then feel bad in my stomach. My mom go outside or whatever, and I went outside and wahh, I started throwing out. It was disgusting. I was like, ""Fuck that, I'm not drinking milk anymore.""Noel:	So you're like lactose intolerant?Jenny:	I'm not lactose intolerant.Noel:	But you still throw up?Jenny:	But still, it doesn't mean I'm not lactose intolerant. It just makes my tummy go [inaudible 00:14:33] .Noel:	You'd be taking Red Bull as milk?Jenny:	No, I think that as water, I don't know. But the Monster had the nitrous or whatever.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	I don't know, but it was smooth.Noel:	You have any [inaudible 00:14:48] ?Jenny:	No, only cookies.Noel:	You had two energy drinks.Jenny:	Those cookies. I was not even that big. I was like six inches or whatever.Noel:	Six inches. [00:15:00] Okay.Jenny:	I don't know what else. I'm just kidding.Noel:	Tell me what's something you want to do before dying.Jenny:	What was that phrase, like a bucket list or whatever.Noel:	Bucket list.Jenny:	Like a bucket list. I haven't seen that movie though.Noel:	Start.Jenny:	For sure, skydiving. I want to do that for sure.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	You know I like being up high and stuff. It's pretty cool. It's like just jumping and just being free, it's crazy.Noel:	For like 10 seconds. The longest, 10 seconds.Jenny:	Ten seconds, not even.Noel:	It depends on the-Jenny:	On the height.Noel:	No, on the company or whatever you go to.Jenny:	The company?Noel:	Yeah. In the news, you got to ran an airplane and you just throw yourself on.Jenny:	Well duh, not like that hopefully.Noel:	You got to go to a training and everything.Jenny:	Well, I know that. I don't know. I want to do that.Noel:	What else?Jenny:	Let me see.Noel:	Has anybody tell you you got some pretty eyes?Jenny:	Shut up. Anyways, I want to go back to El Salvador. I know that.Noel:	Go back and visit?Jenny:	Visit and see my grandma's grave. Do you want to go back and see your mom?Noel:	Yeah. Go to three different states, just buy her every single flower shop.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	Fill up the whole grave there.Jenny:	Do you miss her?Noel:	Yeah, a lot.Jenny:	I'm sorry.Noel:	That's okay.Jenny:	Wow. What do you miss about her?Noel:	You know I miss her. I miss how she used to spoil me.Jenny:	What do you mean?Noel:	She used to spoil me. I was like five years old and she was still carrying me around to take me to shower.Jenny:	That's cute.Noel:	Well, I wasn't that heavy.Jenny:	Yeah, because you were small.Noel:	Yeah. I was born premature.Jenny:	Bite size. I'm sorry.Noel:	Bite size. I was like no bigger than a palm. Yeah, it's crazy. You saw a picture.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	I showed you the picture.Jenny:	You're really not that small though. I swear. You don't look that small because of the picture.Noel:	But I was like so small.Jenny:	What did you have? Why were you born-Noel:	It was my mother who was sick and she was taking medication for her, I think, kidneys. Then the medication was affecting the bag I was in. So it started to get weaker and weaker until the doctor said, ""We had to take him out."" So I never knew. I felt [inaudible 00:18:16] magic tunnel.Jenny:	Oh, my God.Noel:	Do you remember?Jenny:	Yes.Noel:	Was it fun?Jenny:	No.Noel:	No?Jenny:	I don't remember.Noel:	Okay.Jenny:	I just saw a big head, and I was like, ""It's coming out, it's coming out,"" and I'm just kidding.Noel:	Just remember when the doctor spanked you.Jenny:	No.Noel:	Well, that's what they do, right?Jenny:	I don't know.Noel:	To make the babies cry.Jenny:	Why?Noel:	The baby doesn't actually breathe while in the stomach.Jenny:	Oh, yeah. I know because they're breathing through that thingy, I think.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	That umbilical cord.Noel:	That's why when they come out, they're still connected.Jenny:	Wait, were you connected? Yeah, right?Noel:	Yeah, I was connected.Jenny:	Okay. Did you have any like breathing problems when you were premature?Noel:	I don't remember, but I have like something with the size of my liver.Jenny:	Yeah. That's why your sister told you don't freaking drink because you're going to mess up your liver more.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	How did you start drinking?Noel:	Huh?Jenny:	How did you start drinking?Noel:	How did I?Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	It's a long story. I don't remember. It was probably my cousin, I think my cousin.Jenny:	Julio?Noel:	Yeah. He's crazy. Like, ""Oh, right here, have one."" Like, peer pressure. Like, ""Oh, you're not cool because you don't drink."" But, I mean, still now I'm like, you know.Jenny:	Then?Noel:	I stopped for a reason.Jenny:	Why?Noel:	You already know that reason.Jenny:	No, I don't.Noel:	Yeah, you do.Jenny:	Well, [00:20:00] remind me again.Noel:	You want me to remind you? Okay. I don't want to be a hypocrite and tell you not to drink and be drinking.Jenny:	But I don't like drinking. Well, not beer, you know what.Noel:	Drinking is still drinking.Jenny:	Yeah, I know.Noel:	Yeah. So yeah. You inspire me to be a better person.Jenny:	Why?Noel:	Huh?Jenny:	Why?Noel:	Because it's like, I don't know, set an example for you. I'm not your dad but, I mean, I want to be better so you could like me more. So you won't leave me.Jenny:	Do you think I'll leave you?Noel:	Huh?Jenny:	Do you think I'll leave you?Noel:	It's not that. Jenny:	It just crosses your mind.Noel:	It crosses my mind, yeah.Jenny:	Like how?Noel:	Like how?Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	I don't know, just it does.Jenny:	Like just random?Noel:	I'm insecure.Jenny:	Oh, man.Noel:	How about something you would like to change from your past?Jenny:	From my past?Noel:	Yeah, your past.Jenny:	It's that time that I shoplifted and I got caught, my dad, he started crying. I don't like seeing them. Like my brothers told me that it was like 2:00 AM and he saw him crying in the car and drinking, and my brother is like, ""Why are you crying?"" My dad was like, ""No, nothing."" My brother is like, ""No, tell me. Come on tell me. You could tell me."" Then, wow, my dad was like, ""My baby girl, she's growing up already."" I was like, Wow."" I really care about that. I was like, ""Wow, it's good."" Noel:	Most of the guys in your family have drinking problems on? Jenny:	Yeah, my dad used to be a total drunk, you know when I go there. But that was before I was born though because I have no memories of him like being stupid drunk. I only remember Jose, Edwin, and Freddie being like messy drunk. The only one that I remember was Edwin when he tried to commit suicide because of his ex-girlfriend, Reyna, who cheated on him with my cousin. I forgot his name though, but I don't think I've met him, and I remember it was at night. He woke me up and he had lived on the second floor. I don't know if I told you. But yeah, he was crying. I don't even remember, because I remember he broke the window, smashing it, and he climbed out. But good thing we have bars. I remember my dad coming in he was trying to hold him back, and he was just screaming and crying, ""Reyna why,""  something like that. My mom was holding me back, and she's like, ""No, stay away, come over here and leave them alone."" My dad was grabbing him by the arms and he tied them down on the floor. He tied them up with rope and then he drive him to the water tub, I mean the bathtub, and started putting the shower on so he could get sober or something. I don't know. Yeah, I remember that.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	Yeah, you're not that bad. I don't know, he kept drinking until a few years later he got into two DUI's and he crashed. It's a beautiful car. It was so pretty. It was a speed race car. It was white.Noel:	What was it, Thunderbird?Jenny:	It was an Eclipse. Oh, my God. I got so mad when I saw the car, it was all smashed up from the front, like totaled. It was bad. I was like, "" Whoa."" He started going to program like Alcoholics [00:25:00] Anonymous. Start go to meetings and after awhile, after a couple months, he started changing, and they saw that, and I was like, ""What?"" Then after a while he started committing not to drink. He's like, ""No, I'm not going to drink."" Now he has like four hours, I mean, four hours, four years.Noel:	Four hours.Jenny:	Shut up. He's like about four years not drinking.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	Yeah. I mean, he's better now. Like he has his car, he has money. Instead of buying alcohol, he buys them for clothes, or he gives me money, which is cool.Noel:	Yeah. You sound so happy.Jenny:	Yeah. My brothers, Flavio, Jose, and Freddie, they still drink, and now is worse though because Jose is drinking everyday since he lost his job, and he's drinking everyday. I'm telling him. Yesterday too, he wasn't drinking until we got out to go watch Alice in Wonderland at the Regal or Regal or whatever. He want to go buy a drink and I told him, ""Don't drink."" I was like, ""Why do you drink?"" He was like, ""I don't know, it's just an addiction. I just want to drink."" I'm like, ""Wow."" I was like, ""Fine, and if you're going to drink, I'm going to drink too,"" and he's like, ""You're funny, I'm going to slap you if I see you drinking."" I was like, ""Damn it,"" I thought it would work, but no. This is weird. I was like, ""I don't really like drinking too."" I don't want to be like that. I don't want to be ending up in a car crash or going to those meetings and talk about how I fucked up my life over, and how I did that, and we're coming, like, I don't know. Yeah. Okay.Noel:	It's crazy.Jenny:	Yeah. Have you had any type of experiences like that?Noel:	Well, only my grandpa. He didn't just drink, he would smoke too. Back when I used to go visit him. I was a little kid, so I always wanted to hug him and everything. He'll always smell like cigar, and then I used to hide the cigarette boxes and then he would get mad. He would go looking for me.Jenny:	He knew you did it?Noel:	He suspected it, until I told him later on and I was about six or seven. I would tell him, ""If you love me, then stop smoking.""Jenny:	I know, right?Noel:	Yeah, and then he stopped for a while. But I heard since we've been away, me and my sister that he has started drinking again, and smoking.Jenny:	That was recent?Noel:	Yeah. He is old. I remember I called him, he didn't remember me.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	He's old.Jenny:	How old is he?Noel:	He is like 70 something.Jenny:	Wow.Noel:	yeah.Jenny:	My grandmother was around that age when she passed on.Noel:	That's crazy.Jenny:	What do you want to do before you die?Noel:	I want to do a lot of things.Jenny:	Like?Noel:	I want to do something that stays in this world, like probably a baby.Jenny:	Really?Noel:	Not something like start a Foundation. Do something; try to change the world. Like that quote, ""Be the change you want to be.""Jenny:	No, ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" Gandhi.Noel:	Yeah, that one. So I want to do something, set an example. I want to have a family.Jenny:	How many kids do you want to have?Noel:	I want to have like 12.Jenny:	Are you crazy?Noel:	You are not down for a challenge?Jenny:	Excuse me! No. I only want to have about two.Noel:	Two. A boy and a girl?Jenny:	Whatever comes out.Noel:	Whatever comes out?Jenny:	I don't know. I'm guessing I'm going to have mostly boys. Because my mom, [00:30:00] she gave only boys.Noel:	Okay. My main goal is I want to set a good example. My little cousin, Nanny.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	He looks up to me a lot, so that's why I try to minimize best of what I do because he mimics me.Jenny:	Yeah. I have noticed.Noel:	Yeah. I told him I got accepted to university, he was like, ""I am going to university too."" That is definitely good.Jenny:	Like a role model.Noel:	It feels good. My dad has been really good role model except for some little mistakes he made in the past.Jenny:	Like what?Noel:	Have another woman. Mostly that happens when people are away, I want to have [inaudible 00:31:07] so I'll come back, don't worry. I learn.Jenny:	After how long? a year?Noel:	A year? I don't think so. I'll probably come back in spring break. what's wrong? Don't worry. I'm not that type of person.Jenny:	what are you?Noel:	I stick to who I love. I'm faithful.Jenny:	Yeah?Noel:	Yeah. Well, what do you think?Jenny:	Are you going away?Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	It's a big change.Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	I'm going to still be seeing you a lot?Noel:	Yeah. Everyday.Jenny:	Yeah. Talking to you all the time. It's going to be like wow. I know.MALE_1:	Can I ask a quick question? When is this going to happen?Noel:	By September October. I don't know. I'm going to graduate from high-school, June.Jenny:	A hundred and thirteen days.Noel:	Yeah. are you counting? You got a countdown?Jenny:	No. Not even. It is because in our school they have a bulletin board in days until graduation. It says a 113, I saw it today. I was like, no. I keep on seeing that map. It says ""LA around UC Davis."".Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	That's why.Noel:	Because we are too humble.Jenny:	How are you going to come back here? You don't even have a car.Noel:	Airplane.Jenny:	Airplane?Noel:	Yeah.Jenny:	Do you have money?Noel:	No, but I could get some. Work?Jenny:	What are you planning to do?Noel:	I'll work in the campus. Maybe, some loans too.Jenny:	Yeah. [inaudible 00:33:08]Noel:	You are on your way to school.Jenny:	What do you mean me?Noel:	You got one more year.Jenny:	I know. I have one more year. It's scary.Noel:	Yeah. It is scary.Jenny:	Being a senior is like, wow. It's the hardest year, at least at my school.MALE_1:	Can I ask something real quick?Jenny:	Yeah.MALE_1:	Both of you can answer this. What do you think is the biggest challenge for both of you is going to be in the next year? You starting college and you starting your senior.Noel:	Probably the fact that I am going to a whole new world. I will be somewhere I never been before, do things I never done before. It's exciting, but at the same time scary.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	Yeah, I'm going to be away from everything I've ever known. you?Jenny:	For me, deciding where I'm going to go because there's more campuses out there, the colleges and I don't know  [inaudible 00:34:11] right? Yeah, I've visited nice campus is right next to Malibu beach. What if I don't want to be in LA, what if I want to go to New York or the UK.Noel:	Either way, I'll find you.Jenny:	Why are you so sure?Noel:	Because I've found you. Even if you push me away, I've found you.Jenny:	Actually, this sunk into you.Noel:	No.Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	Yeah. After [inaudible 00:34:48] at times frequent to you.Jenny:	Except for that cardinal time.Noel:	Which one?Jenny:	The cardinal.Noel:	Okay. [00:35:00] So yeah.Jenny:	What would you say if I end up going to another country because either way I'm studying abroad. Do you know that?Noel:	Yeah, I know that. We're not there yet, so I'll live day by day.Jenny:	That's how I'm different from you. I think about the future a lot. Sometimes I can live in the moment but sometimes I just wonder about future. It was nice talking to you.Noel:	It was nice talking to you too. Well, the first thing I want to do is give thanks to people. I want to thank [inaudible 00:36:01] for getting us here.Jenny:	Yeah. Thank you [inaudible 00:36:05]. Without him we'd have been lost. We are kind of already lost.Noel:	Downtown?Jenny:	Yeah.Noel:	You wanted to keep-on walking?Jenny:	Walking is good.Noel:	Well, you got the little counting thing.Jenny:	Yes, 11,920 steps.Noel:	That's a lot.Jenny:	Yes, it is.Noel:	It was nice talking to you too. I want to thank you for this conversation.Jenny:	Thank you for being here.Noel:	Thank you for being so sweet, so kind to me.Jenny:	You are welcome.MALE_1:	[inaudible 00:36:51] Just for posterity sake, what was your mom's name?Noel:	Aurelia.MALE_1:	Fully?Noel:	Aurelia Candelaria Dias .MALE_1:	Where is she buried?Noel:	San Gerardo .MALE_1:	Where's that?Noel:	El SalvadorMALE_1:	Thank you, guys.Jenny:	Okay.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
MBY006281,"Laura Richards:	[00:00:00] My name's Laura Richards. I'm 58 years old. Today's date is March 7th, 2010. I'm in East Los Angeles with my dear friend, Michelle Sousa.Michelle Sousa:	My name is Michelle Sousa. I'm 58 years old as well. Today's date is March 7th, 2010. I am in East Los Angeles and I am with Laura Richards, a dear friend of mine.Laura Richards:	So Michelle, you and I have known each other since 1974. It's a really long time. So we've had lots and lots of conversations over the years about a million things, and one thing you've talked a lot about to me is your family, specifically your mother. I know that you're really proud of a lot of things that she did. She led a really interesting life. So I was going to ask you about some of that stuff.Michelle Sousa:	Well, I'll try to tell you as best I can remember about the whole history of my family. We are from the Hawaiian Islands. My mother was born in 1918 in North Kohala on the Big Island of Hawaii. Her parents married when they were 16 and 22 years old. When her mother was 17, she got pregnant with my mother. She walked five miles to hospital down the plantation rows, and she had my mother. My mother was less than two pounds at the time of her birth, and she had no name. So they took her home and they used to let her sleep in a drawer. They used to feed her by dipping a handkerchief into milk and having her suckle on it. When she was three days old, the godparents took her to the Catholic Church because they were staunch Catholics, and you wanted to have a baby baptized as soon as possible. So they took her to the Catholic church, and there was a French priest there who had come over with some other French priest to evangelize the native Hawaiians. He asked what her name was and they said just baby girl, she has no name and he said, ""Well, when was she born?"" They said February 3rd. She was born on February 3rd, 1918. He said, ""Well, I'll name her Santos Blasias, which is the word for Saint Blaise, the saint of that day. So Santos Blasias she was until she was three years old, at which point she came to my grandparents and said, ""I don't want to be named that anymore because Santos is a man's name and I'm a girl."" So they named her Blasina. She actually remained Blasina until she went to school and she had an English teacher from probably the East Coast, and when she was asked her name and she said Blasina, the teacher just wrote the name down as Blase, B-L-A-S-E without an accent on the end. So it's not Blasse, it's not Blaze with a z, it's Blase with an S, and she was always very staunchly wanted you to know her name was Blase, without the z and without the accent. So my mom grew up in North Kohala. She was the oldest of six children and she, first of all, loved to read. Her father did not know how to read when he came to this country from Puerto Rico at the turn of the century, but he taught himself to read in Spanish, and he would read to them from Don Quixote, and so she became this amazing reader. She used to actually go into the bedroom and get a book and read behind the trunk, and thereby not doing her chores. Her parents saw this but would forgive her and let her read. So she just became this person that was always in quest of information. So she graduated, she went to school on the Big Island, and when she graduated, she went to the University of Hawaii. She is the oldest of six children and she was the only one to further her education. She went to the University of Hawaii in Oahu, she took the boat there from the Big Island. She graduated in 1939 with a BA. She was the very first Puerto Rican of any gender, male or female, to graduate at that time. The very first Puerto Rican to graduate from the University of Hawaii.Laura Richards:	What did she study?Michelle Sousa:	I think she got a BA in teaching. Basically, at that time you could only be a teacher or a nurse. So she became a teacher. She stayed on that Island, she worked for like Holly households which are the white folk at the time. She was a cleaner. She worked at the Dole pineapple canning plant. She worked for the University of Hawaii, not a teaching capacity, but maybe as an assistant or something, and she also did some teaching.Laura Richards:	So did she stay on Oahu after she graduated?Laura Richards:	[00:05:00] Well, she did that until she decided that she wanted to further her career along, so she decided to become a librarian, but what happened right at this time? This was 1939 when she graduated. The war happened. So during the war, she worked with the USO. She danced with the soldiers.Laura Richards:	I know, I remember you gave me a book called The Last Strange Place and there's a whole chapter about the USO and they talk about Blase in the book.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah. She'd go out with the soldiers. She had really interesting times like at that point, that was when she was in [inaudible 00:05:32] and there were a bunch of soldiers and bunch of girls on the beach and a tidal wave happened. Went out to sea and they were all running in and they could see the ocean coming back in at them a one big wave. She had like really interesting experiences like that.Laura Richards:	Didn't you also tell me that she saw the planes coming over to Pearl Harbor?Michelle Sousa:	I don't remember if she did or not. She saw the green flash though once.Laura Richards:	I'm fascinated by the green flash and I've searched for the green flash, and I'm very envious.Michelle Sousa:	She's seen the green flash.MALE_1:	So what is the green flash?Michelle Sousa:	Actually, I just saw it for the first time ever when I was visiting my home a couple years ago. It's when everything aligns in the sky as the sun is setting, and there's a certain haze in the sky. All the conditions are right. Just when the sun is right at the horizon line, there's a green flash.Laura Richards:	Over the ocean?Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, over the ocean. It's only over the ocean. There's like this green flash. I never saw it. Normally, years of growing up in Hawaii until like two years ago when I was 56 years old, I was pretty amazed. But my mom always would talk about the green flash and I was always very envious that I never got to see the green flash. So anyhow, after the war, she and my godmother went to New York because my mom had been accepted to Pratt Institute. It's not in Manhattan. My aunt went to Columbia and my mom went to Pratt and I can't remember which borough that's in, but she went to Pratt Institute.Laura Richards:	Was this the first time she'd ever been off the Island?Michelle Sousa:	The very first time.Laura Richards:	She had only ever been on a boat and then they were taking planes and trains?Michelle Sousa:	Yeah. So they took a plane to the West Coast and they took a train across the country. Totally these two little Hawaiian girls, they had gone through the war together and they were older. So I think my mom with that point was probably about 26 or 27. They took the train all the way across to New York and she spent four years at Pratt. She had these great stories. One of them, which I absolutely loved was she was in a class. I think they were two women and a bunch of men all becoming librarians. The teacher asked, ""Did anybody know what this CBI was?"" My mom looked around and nobody was raising their hands, and so she raised hers and the teacher said, ""Yes."" She said, ""The China-Burma-India Theater,"" which is the war at the Pacific Theater in World War II, it was that China-Burma-India Theater. Well, it turns out it was actually the cumulative book index because it was a library class. But I say, mom got a lot of points for answering the question, when nobody else knew, she knew what CBI was, it was just the wrong CBI. She took her classes, but she actually had a great time in New York. She used to tell us that stories because just little snippets of seeing people like Billie Holiday perform, and Marian Anderson singing, and Jose Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac, and Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire, she had to see the Stella, Stella, Stella. She graduated, I think it was 1947 maybe or '48, somewhere in there. I can't really remember. I have to look at my notes, but it's not that important, '46-'48. She went back to the islands after she graduated, because I think she missed him, but more importantly, she had a job lined up there. Jobs are hard to come by. So she went back to the islands, and she met my dad, and she cooked him a meal. Before they do that, there was two couples, a blind date thing, my mom and my dad and this other couple that introduced him. But she cooked him a home-cooked meal and he fell in love with her in there over her pork chops or whenever they were, and proposed two weeks later, and they waited a while, but they got married, I think, in 1948.Laura Richards:	Wow, that must have been some culture shock on two ends. One going from the islands to New York, and then coming back after four years of all of that coming back home.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, I think it was. I have a great photo of her in New York in the snow, which I absolutely love, because she's just [00:10:00] in this big old snow drift in Central Park and she looks so happy. My mom always embraced where she was and she wasn't afraid to go to new places, even at the end of her life when she came to live with us. Anyhow, she met my dad and they got married, eventually. I was born in 1952 and my sister was born in 1954, there's only two of us. We lived on Oahu.Laura Richards:	On Nohu Street.Michelle Sousa:	On Nohu Street. My mother was my librarian when I was a kid. The school was only about two blocks away from the house, so I go to school. There are two things I remember about this story, she was the children's librarian, it was just like a grade school. Number 1, she never let me get away with anything in the library. When classes would come in and I fool around because I thought, ""Well, I'm the daughter of the library, I can get away with this."" No. Mom was like, I was just another kid in that class. The other thing which she did, which was wonderful, was she'd go in on the weekends and work on special arts and crafts projects so she might have something to do, and she take my sister and I with her. Pat and I would just run around in the library and look at the books, everywhere, fiction, non-fiction. I mean, we're young. I can remember the smell of the library and the smell of the books, it was just wonderful. I think that's another reason why I love to read. I can't not read, it would kill me if I couldn't read.Laura Richards:	Well, that must be one of the things that keeps us good friends because my grandmother was a librarian.Michelle Sousa:	That's right.Laura Richards:	Books were always a huge thing in our life. I know you've expressed interest sometimes if you'd love to have a used book story, you'd like to own, and how we like to hold books, and open books, and read books.Michelle Sousa:	I know. I just love titles and covers.Laura Richards:	We'll never be a kindled person.Michelle Sousa:	No, I don't think we ever will be. There's just something to be said for turning a page. I just can't scroll. I don't know, anyhow. My mom rose up in the library world of Hawaii and she worked for the State of Hawaii at the end, it's like teaching other librarians and processes, stuff like that. Then she retired. When she retired at age 50, she took what she knew as a librarian in all the research and stuff that you do when you're librarian, and she transferred that into trying to find out about her family. So she started with her family and that expanded to this second career on her. She was almost busier after she retired than when she had been working. What she did was my mom decided to study the history of the diaspora from Puerto Rico to Hawaii. She wrote about the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico in 1900, it's called San Ciriaco, and that sent everybody from Puerto Rico to other places. One be in Hawaii, the second one was probably the East Coast and the West Coast, in search of better times because there's nothing to do in Puerto Rico, everything was decimated. All the fields, everything. Hawaii was very much like Puerto Rico in terms of the crops that they built, the longitude and latitude, and their place in the world. So my mom started to write about that and research it.Laura Richards:	Did her parents come over in that first wave?Michelle Sousa:	Her father came over and I believe her mom was born on the Big Island. Because her father came over when he was seven and her mom was, well, maybe her mom was a baby, I'm not sure. Anyhow, she wrote a couple books, she wrote a book with my dad and I always said they were like this team. My mother was Don Quijote, like up on the horse, tilting that windmills and just finding all this stuff out. My father was the faithful typist on the donkey, down below. She had these dreams, but he actually put them on paper. He could explain the questions like the nuts and bolts thing. So they were like this little team together, and they wrote a book together which was published, which I think is in its second printing, which I think you've seen. Then my mom wrote another book with a colleague of hers about a Puerto Rican poet named Fraticelli. People still call me about the first book, wanting to find their ancestors, because at the end of the book, my father and she compiled a list of all the families that had come over on these five or seven boats and all their names. People still to this day call me and say, ""Where can I get this book?"" I say, ""I'm sorry, it's out of print right now. I think they're reprinting it."" [00:15:00] That was back in Hawaii through the Puerto Rican Heritage Society which she also started. I'm far away from that now.Laura Richards:	Then you go to Puerto Rico with her? I remember that.Michelle Sousa:	I went to Puerto Rico and I went to Portugal and Spain. After my father passed away in 1996 when my mom was 76 or so. She was about 80 at the time. We did three trips, actually. One trip was to Spain, she would talk to the conference, she met her colleague there. I think they were talking about that poet named Fraticelli at the time. Another time we went to Nashville, that was actually for my honeymoon, I eloped in Las Vegas, New Mexico with my husband.Laura Richards:	I remember I got a phone call from you, and you were like, ""Guess who I'm seeing?"" Because my sister lived in Nashville. You guys were in the Nashville, the Opryland Hotel.Michelle Sousa:	Opryland Hotel.Laura Richards:	My other sister was visiting my other sister, so my sisters were together, and they've met you.Michelle Sousa:	No, I had met one sister, Sherry once. I don't know if I met her once or never, but I've seen pictures, and so I saw this woman and I went, ""Oh my God,"" I went up to her and I said, ""Are you Sherry Richards?"" She goes, ""Yes."" Then I said, ""Oh my God, I've known your sister forever. She's one of my closest friends."" It was Sherry and your older sister Mindy, who I've never met until then, who I'd heard many stories about. It was so incredible to be far away from everything and run into people you know.Laura Richards:	You call me and you goes, ""Laura, guess who I'm with?""Michelle Sousa:	It was pretty incredible.Laura Richards:	So my sisters got to meet Blaze.Michelle Sousa:	Yes. She was older, we went to Spain and we took a side trip to Portugal because that's where my father's family was from. We went to Porto, which is little town north of Lisbon. We were looking for my father's uncle who had retired there and it turns out he had died. But we had this mad, hilarious one day trip, which if I ever make a movie I'm going to call searching for Uncle Eddie. Because we literally made this circle around town and we got all these Portuguese people involved and they're all cramming into the taxi with us. None of us really all speak the same language, but we find the place, we find the town. It turns out he's dead and his wife's got into the sea side. But we found his little village, and then when we go back, and the woman says, ""He's buried in the cemetery."" We go back to the cemetery and they have a really nice monument to him or whatever. It turns out the cemetery is right behind the apartment building that we started out with that day looking for him. So I figured if it'll be a movie about a full circle. We have these little adventures and I would go as her companion. My husband would say I drift, but she was drifting. So I was like their herder, and I was the companion, and I would take care of things. We did that in Nashville, we did that in Madrid, and we did that in Puerto Rico until we went back to Puerto Rico. Again, she had a conference.Laura Richards:	I remember when you came back, you were really excited about what a good time you had.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah. It was part of my heritage. It was part of my history.Laura Richards:	Met a lot of people.Michelle Sousa:	Right. That's what she did. Then when she was 81, she decided it was too hard to live in Hawaii by herself because my sister was living in Northeast Seattle and Everette and I was in LA, and she took the great leap of coming here. She never expressed any fear of leaving. She felt that family was the most important thing, like going to New York, just having another adventure. My mom wasn't afraid to have another adventure. We kept the house, I think my father before he died, he told her to sell it, and my sister wanted to. I said, ""No, we should keep it."" In hindsight, that was important because I think even though she was adventurous, that was always her associate on.Laura Richards:	She always knew that that was there.Michelle Sousa:	Right. So she'd spent half the year with us and half the year with my sister up North. Then she moved up there because it was easier, and her grandson was up there, and just too hard living with us. Then they moved to Albuquerque and I moved my mom to Albuquerque, that was about a year and a half ago. She was pretty elderly at the time, like 89 or 90. Then she passed away about, I don't know, six months after she'd been there. Something really actually quick. Maybe less than that, maybe three months. But she just had this great story. She had this great history. She was interesting though. She was an educator. She was a teacher, and that came out sort of inner personality. [00:20:00] As she got older too, it was like, ""Well, this is the way it is."" Everything was like, ""Okay, I'm the teacher. So therefore, this is what I say, and so what I say is right,"" and I'm going, ""No."" But it's hard to contradict somebody when they're nine years old as well.Laura Richards:	Well, my mother was a teacher and I think the quality that they share is, ""You want to learn how to do this, and we're going to learn how to do this.""Michelle Sousa:	Right.Laura Richards:	If you express interest in something, then they say, ""Let's do this.""Michelle Sousa:	Yes.Laura Richards:	We'll learn how to do this together or if she knew how to do it, she teach us. I think that's how you have a lot of adventures by saying, ""Well, I've never done this before, but let's figure out.""Michelle Sousa:	Let's try it, yeah. She and my father are both people that always wanted their two daughters to be happy, and that was the most important thing. I remember when I was 18, coming from the Puerto Rican family, it was like I was supposed to be married. I was the oldest granddaughter. When I was 18 years old, all my aunts and uncles, all her brothers and sisters were going, ""Well, why isn't Michelle married? Michelle should be married, Michelle should be married."" My parents would say, ""You know what? Leave her alone. If she's happy, we're happy. She doesn't have to be married if she doesn't want to be married."" They were the only ones that stood up for me.Laura Richards:	They let you go off to have your own adventures.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, exactly. If they had any reservations, if they had any fears about where I was going or what I was doing, both my sister and I, they never, ever, ever express that unless we ask them. Then they would tell us what they felt. But they really gave us the freedom to be who we are. I think on both, they're great. My dad has little stories because I don't know his family nearly as well as my moms, but what I remember when he was young and living in Hilo, and he had a younger brother, they'd tie themselves to the lawnmower, just to push a lawnmower because they were so little, it would take two of them and they'd have to tie themselves to the front of the lawnmower to mow the lawn. I mean, they're just little kids. Back then, mom, when you were a little kid, you still had your chores and you still did your stuff.Laura Richards:	Absolutely. You had a lot you had to do and you're expected to do.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah.Laura Richards:	You're expected to behave in a certain way.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah.Laura Richards:	Well, I think it's interesting the people who come from the era of our parents because there were so much change happening. We think there's a lot of change now, but really some of the changes were really monumental.Michelle Sousa:	Right.Laura Richards:	How they dealt with life that changed at the same time some things didn't change much at all.Michelle Sousa:	Right.Laura Richards:	But for her to be able to go and just say, ""I'm going to New York,"" when she's never been out of off the island is just astounding. That's a big trip.Michelle Sousa:	That is a big trip.Laura Richards:	I remember you talking about how when you're growing up on the island is that going to the mainland was a big deal.Michelle Sousa:	It took eight hours on the plane and we'd get all dressed up with gloves, and it's hot there, and you get all dressed up. I have pictures with little bobby socks and shoes. I never wear shoes to school or anything. So those are special occasion, and a dress, and we get on the plane. But again, the first time my sister and I traveled, we traveled together by ourselves because at that time, first of all, it was more concern. Parents would try to not split. Like the family wouldn't travel together in case the plane went down or something.Laura Richards:	Right.Michelle Sousa:	But for some reason, my sister and I went on head before my parents. My parents had the faith, and the courage, and the whatever, and didn't show any.Laura Richards:	Where were you flying to?Michelle Sousa:	We flew to Los Angeles, but we're actually were picked up by an uncle, my uncle Eddie, the one from Portugal, and we stayed with him in San Pedro until my parents came over. I don't know why. I just remembered getting on the plane and being afraid, and my sister was two years younger, going, ""Come on, Michelle, we're getting on the plane."" She was always a lot just stick with me.Laura Richards:	I remember taking the plane all by myself when I was 10. In those days, because we're old people.Michelle Sousa:	Right. Yes.Laura Richards:	You dressed up to get on the plane?Michelle Sousa:	Yes, you did.Laura Richards:	It was a bit much bigger deal than it is now.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah.Laura Richards:	The stewardesses wore this military type uniforms and they've handout gum so people wouldn't get air sick.Michelle Sousa:	One in Hawaii. When you landed in Hawaii, man, they'd have a fresh, oh God, it was so good. You land, you just get off the plane. You wouldn't go into terminal, you can just come down and when would be the trade winds or something. Then they'd be there with a tray, with little paper cups of fresh ice cold pineapple juice. Oh, my God, it was the best thing ever.Laura Richards:	There's something about getting off a plane on the tarmac in Hawaii, and those soft trade winds. Just kind of caressing your skin, it's just, ""This is so great.""Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, it's beautiful.Michelle Sousa:	It was really beautiful place to grow up.Michelle Sousa:	It is a beautiful place and I'm always proud that I grew up in a territory. [00:25:00] I like that idea of, people when they asked me where I'm from, I tell them Hawaii because that's where I feel like I'm from. I've lived in San Francisco. I went to school in Claremont. I've lived here in LA now for 20 years and there's a part of me that feels, but I feel like my essence is in Hawaii. When people asked me what I am, because my father was Portuguese and Japanese, and my mom was Puerto Rican, I feel like I'm a triple minority.Laura Richards:	But in Hawaii, that's a common.Michelle Sousa:	Yes, it's common.Laura Richards:	It was very common because there's so many people that came to Hawaii from so many different places.Michelle Sousa:	Right. But my mom, yeah, she has an interesting lady. She was an interesting lady.Laura Richards:	Yeah, I know.MALE_1:	Can I ask what maybe, it's maybe not the greatest lesson, but what are the lessons that you learned from them?Michelle Sousa:	I think I learned from her to be adventuresome, to have a good work ethic, to not be afraid to go to new places. I really don't have any fears about going to parts of the city that people might not want to go to.Laura Richards:	You're a fearless little papaya.Michelle Sousa:	I try to be, and to just have courage, to go through my life, just having courage. To live my life as fully as I can. I guess that's it. She was interesting though. Of the two of them, my father, I think was the one that was more relaxed. My mom, because she was a teacher, was like, ""Okay. This, this, this, and this."" My dad would go, ""Hey, just calm down, relax"", or whatever. So from him, I got that. I think I'm a good balance.MALE_1:	I'm trying to picture what she looks like. When you envision your mother, can you describe what pops into your head or how would you describe her?Michelle Sousa:	What pops into my head is a woman that is wearing a muumuu and wearing a big Lauhala hat, which is like a woven hat, but also has on a necklace with a cross and the cross is turquoise from one of her travels in the South West or something. She was an island lady from Hawaii, but there was something else that she had that made her Puerto Rican or Latina or whatever. It's really hard for me to explain, I think. She wasn't very tall, but she was strong and she was very limber because we didn't have a clothes dryer, so we'd hang everything on the clothes line, and so even up until when she left Hawaii and when she was 81, she'd still be hanging stuff so she was always on her tip toes. When she was actually, I think about 87 or 88 I remember, in Seattle North of Santa when she was living in her little place next to my sister's, she was in a retirement facility, she actually got down on the ground in the living room on the carpet to find something. _elf, she got all the way down at age 87, and I remember my husband Jim being there, just watching her like, ""Oh, my God."" She got down and she got up on her own without any help. It took her a while, but she did it.Laura Richards:	So she was small in stature as you are?Michelle Sousa:	She was small in stature. I don't know how to describe rather than that. She did have my grandfather's nose but she was the Taino-Indian. Part of the family was the Puerto Ricans. She always used to say she was Puerto Rican, and this was a big thing that I couldn't understand. The end of her life, when she had a little dementia, she would say she wasn't Puerto Rican. I would be like, ""What are you talking about, mom?"" She'd be with me and I'd say, ""I'm Puerto Rican"", and she'd hit my arm. I would be going, ""What are you doing?"" She goes, ""You're not [00:30:00] Puerto Rican."" I'm going, ""What does that mean?"" The Puerto Ricans are basically was an island, and the Taino-Indians were the natives there. Just like the Hawaiians were the natives in Hawaii, and then Hawaii and Puerto Rico were all the immigrants came in. So you had Spanish and Italian. One set of my family, my grandfather's side were from Italy, but part of the family were actually Taino. So my mother had this beaky nose like her father, which I think is an Indian, it was very Indian face, compared to some of the other ones in the family. I have one uncle who married a Danish woman so all my first cousins are blonde and blue-eyed. Then I have another set of first cousins, my aunt married a man who was Korean and Japanese. So they all look very Asian. When you get us all together, like this giant melting pot.Laura Richards:	Like a lot of people in Hawaii?Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, like a lot of people in Hawaii.Laura Richards:	It's a small island and a lot of people came, and all intermingled.Michelle Sousa:	Yes, they did.Laura Richards:	I remember James Michener when he wrote Hawaii, the last section is called The Golden Man, and the one character is the amalgam of all the characters that have come to the island. That's a lot of times where I think about a lot of stuff in Hawaii.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah. It's pretty all mixed up.Laura Richards:	It's all mixed up.Michelle Sousa:	Like chop suey, they say.Laura Richards:	Like chop suey, an American dish. Well, I know you're really proud of your mom because I've heard you speak of her a lot.Michelle Sousa:	Why, I am, and her stuff is known the Centro de Estudios Puertorriquenos at Hunter College in New York. A woman came out and actually went through all her papers, all the notes she'd written about all these genealogies of the diaspora and the families and stuff. Her stuff is back there and its for people to look at, that are interested in Puerto Ricans, and I'm really proud of that, that she gave her stuff. I still have a lot of her stuff, a lot of her writings which are hard for me to go through because they're incomplete. Some of them are just like one sentence on a page. But little by little, I'm winnowing them away. I have a lot of photographs. She loved to take photography even when she was young. So I have a lot of photographs of my family's history from the '20s, and the '30s, and the '40s and stuff, which are wonderful to see her with all her leis when she graduated, a couple pictures of her in the snow in New York.Laura Richards:	That's why I think it's so great that we still have things on paper.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah.Laura Richards:	I worry about digital.Michelle Sousa:	Right. You can't put it on Kindle.Laura Richards:	Yeah, going away. But when you have a piece of paper, it can last a long time. Even if it's in a box for a long time.Michelle Sousa:	Exactly.Laura Richards:	Then you look it up and you see you someone's handwriting and you go, ""Oh, wow! I remember that.""Michelle Sousa:	Yeah. She wrote everything down. It was really important to her teaching. Information was really, really important to her. Whether it was to little kids like me when I was younger, to everybody that reads the books and stuff, and still calls and says, ""Hey, where can I get this book?"" The little teeny slice of pie of the piece of the world that she documented, and I'm really proud of her for doing that, and I'm proud of my dad for being by her side.Laura Richards:	Being her typist.Michelle Sousa:	Being her typist, being her travel companion, being her right arm when she needed it, letting her do what she wanted to do.Laura Richards:	I think it's important to remember where we came from and the things that they dealt with that we didn't have to deal with.Michelle Sousa:	She was pretty cool. I would have liked it if you'd met her. You would have liked her.Laura Richards:	I never met her. Over all the years we we're friends, I never met her, which I thought was so ironic.Michelle Sousa:	But I haven't met your mom yet and I still want to because I feel like I know your mom intimately.Laura Richards:	One of these days, I'll get her down here.Michelle Sousa:	I know. I really want to meet your mom.Laura Richards:	Yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't get to meet yours. But I know her a lot.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, you do know her a lot, don't you?Laura Richards:	Yeah, and I have that book you gave me.Michelle Sousa:	Yeah, yeah.Laura Richards:	Well, it's been really good talking to you about your mom.Michelle Sousa:	Well, thank you. I'd love to come back again someday, and you'll have to talk about your dad.Laura Richards:	We all have stories to tell.Michelle Sousa:	That's true. That's a whole another story.Laura Richards:	A whole another story. Well, aloha and mahalo.Michelle Sousa:	Thank you. Aloha to you too, babe.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
MBY006309,"Audrey Diaz: [00:00:00] Hi, my name is Audrey Diaz, I'm 35 years old. Today's date is March 13th, 2010, and we're in East Los Angeles, and I'm here today with my parents, Jose Diaz and Stella Diaz.Jose Diaz: My name is Jose Diaz, I'm 57. Today's date is March 13th, 2010. Location is East Los Angeles, and my relationship to the partners here is Audrey, I'm her father and my wife, Stella Diaz.Stella Diaz: Hello, my name is Stella Diaz, I'm 54 years old. Today's March 13th, 2010. I'm in East Los Angeles and I am here with my husband Jose and daughter Audrey.Audrey Diaz: Let's get started. Well, mom and dad, I have a few questions for you because I hope that your voices live on for a very long time for those who don't get to meet you or see you. So I want to just talk a little bit about where you've been and who you are today. So if we could just start with a little bit about where you were born, maybe a little bit about what you know of your parents, and then we can go from there. So who would like to start, mom or dad?Stella Diaz: Okay, we'll start with me.Audrey Diaz: Your mom?Stella Diaz: My mom.Audrey Diaz: Go ahead.Stella Diaz: Okay. What was the first question?Audrey Diaz: So what do you know about your parents and their story?Stella Diaz: Well, first of all, the mom and dad I know are Rose and Mike [inaudible 00:01:46] . I was adopted. Don't know very much about my biological parents. I do know that they were of Mexican descent and possibly from Texas. However, I did grow up with my mom and dad, Rose and Mike [inaudible 00:02:03]  and they were great, great parents. Here in Los Angeles is where I grew up. Go ahead.Audrey Diaz: Tell me a little bit about Mike and Rose, grandma and grandpa.Stella Diaz: Let's see. Well, my father Mike was from Italy. Although he was born in Mexico, he went on to Italy to live there. He was raised there, came to America when he was about 16 years old somewhere. He and his brother and his father, they came here, stopped in New York, went on to Chicago. From Chicago, he went into the military and was discharged at the proceeding on San Francisco and then worked his way down to Los Angeles.Audrey Diaz: About what year was that?Stella Diaz: Oh, that's probably in the 1940s.Audrey Diaz: Great. Grandma Rose?Stella Diaz: Well, grandma. Let's see. All I know is that she was one of the few people that I didn't know that lived in the famous Chavez Ravine area where the Dodger Stadium now stands. So of course, she didn't like the Dodgers because they took her home away, which is very sad, I thought. But anyway, she had I think four, five brothers, sisters, had a nice little family. But there was lot of tragedy in her family, with her mom and dad, brothers and sisters. She and her sister, they lived together. They had a very, very close bond. I did know my aunt Isabel, is her name, and it was very sad when she died. Mama was very sad when she died. They were very close, like I said. Let see, my auntie died in 1962 or '63. It's interesting how grandchildren just make you come alive because I know that when you were born, and when Nadia came, your sister, it looked as if mama came alive again. I truly believe those were the best years of her life. Papa died right after Nadia was born, about less than a year, but she was about a year old or so and he passed away. But mama got to enjoy the fruits of grandchildren and I could tell that she was very happy.Audrey Diaz: Wonderful. Daddy, tell me a little bit about what you know about your ancestors and your crazy father, Mr. Juan Diaz. So those psyches man.Jose Diaz: [00:05:00] Yes, yes. Well, let's see. My father, your grandpa's name is Juan Diaz and he was born in Acaponeta, Nayarit, Mexico, and my biological mother, her name is Consuelo Ruiz Cabello, and she's from Mazatlan. Apparently, they met in Mazatlan at this big bakery. She used to work in the front where they sell the bread. Of course, he was working the back where they make bread. So he was a baker, and he must have been around 18, and I think my mom was around 18 when they met, and one thing led to another, and they got together and I was born. Then grandpa, like many other young men, trying to make a better future for their family, he came to the United States somewhere around that time in 1950, '51 or so, before I was born, with the hopes of making something better and send money down there and he left me with my mom, with my grandma Encarnacion Encarnacion Garcia Diaz right down in Acaponeta. Things didn't workout, I was eventually raised by my grandma. I came to Tijuana when I was probably about four with my little cousin Salvador, because he was about a couple of years younger than I was and grandma raise both of us, and we live in Tijuana. Then we went back one more time. That was probably about '57, and then came back to Tijuana around 1960. My grandma passed away right around 1961. My dad did marry a woman named Gloria Sanchez, who now I call mom because she was truly my mother, I felt, and she raised me to the toughest time in my life. They were married, and interesting to note, she was just really 11 years older than I was so that was interesting. Then I have a sister that was born a year after I got here. My sister's name is Sonya Mikaela Diaz. Mikaela is named after my fathers grandmother. That would be maternal grandmother. So that's a little bit about us.Audrey Diaz: So tell me a little bit about how you came to this country and what your journey was like, what you remember.Jose Diaz: Well, it's interesting. The same things happen. When my grandmother passed away in 1961, my dad, at that time felt that he didn't want to leave me there with my cousins, and he'd already started a family with my mom, Gloria. So they immigrated me. That time, I guess papers weren't that hard and I was a little kid, I was only nine. So in August of 1961, I believe, that's when I came to this country. I remember, it was really interesting. The immigration person, he was a Caucasian guy and he's maybe a first speaking Spanish. I remember he says, he told me in Spanish, ""Listen, what are you going to do?"", and I say, ""I'm going to study."" He goes, ""Be a good American."" It was interesting. So I remember getting on the bus, a great [inaudible 00:09:08] bus, it's a double-decker, and I always had little double-decker buses because my dad given to me for Christmas. So it was always a dream come true. I get to ride, when I came to America, a double-decker. That was neat.Audrey Diaz: Great. Now, both of you grew up in the East Los Angeles area or Boyle Heights. What would you call it East LA or Boyle Heights?Stella Diaz: Los Angeles. At that time, they didn't distinguish between East LA, maybe Boyle Heights but not East Los Angeles. So for me, it was Los Angeles.Jose Diaz: Same here. I was right at the border, Indiana. So that's a boundary between Los Angeles and I guess, East Los Angeles. So I was [inaudible 00:09:59] right there, so [00:10:00] didn't know anything. I went to Lorena Elementary, which is actually in the city of Los Angeles.Audrey Diaz: Okay.Jose Diaz: Yeah.Audrey Diaz: So mom, why don't you tell me a little bit about how you met Mr. Diaz over here?Stella Diaz: Well, let's see. It was 1970. 1970? Wow. Okay. 1970. I had just gotten into high school, Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. It was the last day of summer school, and so everybody was going to the big dance, the last thing, I guess, of summer, whatever. It was interesting because I remember my mom was very, very strict and didn't let us go anywhere, but it was strange. But I asked her just one time and she said, ""Sure go. Have a good time."" Your dad's going to take you and pick you up, but have a good time."" I didn't care who took me or pick me up. I was going to go to the dance. So my friends and I, we met there and we had a great time, until we met these three other boys.Audrey Diaz: Do you want to say clowns?Stella Diaz: Clowns? No. They were there just like we were. Well, basically, I wanted to dance. I really wasn't interested. I love to dance and listen to the music. At that time, they didn't have DJs, it was all live bands. This is in 1970s, so it was still the '60s era. So it was all live band, it was so much fun. Then once the band took a break, like lights were on and people went and get punch or whatever it was in. There was no music, it was all downtime. You didn't play records. It was just, yeah. But anyway, so this really nice song came on and two of three of my other friends, we wanted to dance and there was really no one, and you didn't ask boys to dance, or at least we didn't. So we've waited, and waited, and waited until finally these three figures came towards us and it came to find out it was dad, his best friend, Robert, and another little guy, chubby little guy. I remember. Well, dad didn't ask me, he asked Carolina who was the tallest and I guess prettiest since, whatever. Anyway, and I got asked, thank God. The other guy chickened out, so our poor little friend Margie got left behind but Carolina and I got to dance. So we're having a good time. So the song finished, holding up the wall, and the guys followed us, of course. So dad started talking to Carolina. I was like, ""Wait a minute, I want to dance but I didn't want that other guy. I like this one here."" So I started poking, bugging him, ""Hey, hey. I'm over here. Hello.""Audrey Diaz: That's awesome.Stella Diaz: It was quite comical, but to me, it's okay. So I guess he finally got the message. He say, ""Okay. Let's got to hands.""Audrey Diaz: Great one, dad.Stella Diaz: So we went out to dance, and of course, it was fast song, which was great, we're dancing and whatever, and then it turns into the slow one, so oh my God. What do I do? Yikes. So we looked at each other and he looks at me and he said, ""So he says, do you want to dance?"" ""I guess, we're out here."" That was pretty much it. My girlfriend, her father was coming to pick her up as well at 10:30, I had till 11:00, so she had to go home and I kept to stay. So I had a half-hour extra to hang out with your dad and to dance and to talk, and it was fun. I remember that night I gave him my phone number and my dad was outside waiting and I remember jumping in the car, and I was really happy and excited. I told my dad, I met a really nice guy and I told them, please, tell mom answer the phone tomorrow because he's going to call me.Audrey Diaz: Smart thinking.Stella Diaz: Yes. That was pretty much it. We talked on the phone for a month until we saw each other again in September. From there on, he was a senior [00:15:00] and I had just gotten into Garfield. I remember he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was a little concerned because he was already a senior and I thought, you probably have a bunch of other girlfriends lined up, wherever there was places he could go I couldn't. I just told them, no, I didn't think that was a good idea. They said, ""Well, let's try it. Let's see if it works. Well, okay, gullible. What the heck?"" I liked him. There was something about him that I really, really like. He was very sincere. I saw that he could be easily molded, so.Audrey Diaz: Maybe not so easily.Stella Diaz: Well, how many years now? That's how our relationship started.Audrey Diaz: So let's fast forward a little to when you proposed.Jose Diaz: [inaudible 00:15:50] if you don't mind, I'd like to rebuttal that.Audrey Diaz: No time, no time. I want to hear about the proposal. I think mom's version is accurate.Jose Diaz: All right. The proposal, interesting enough, 2010. In 1973, it was right here, literally, not in this trailer, but in this park. There's a tree back there. We made some sandwiches and I bought some Cracker Jacks and my mom, God rest her soul, she helped me. Actually, she gave me the idea because I was thinking, well, how do I propose to her? So she says, well, maybe you want to wrap the ring in something. Of course, at that time, we couldn't drink or go to restaurants or something really fancy, so to drink, of course, that's what I thought was fancy. So anyways, I took a Cracker Jack box, I took the gift real careful, and I put it in there, the ring. So then we went out and we had a lunch right there and we already carved our name on the tree there.Audrey Diaz: Nice.Jose Diaz: So we started, and I said, oh, and I opened up the Cracker Jack box and, ""Oh, look, there's something here for you."" So I gave it to her and she goes, yeah, she opened it, and I don't think she realized it was a ring. She thought it was one of those fake.Audrey Diaz: A toy?Jose Diaz: A toy. She was, ""Oh, look, looks like a wedding ring,"" and it's like, ""Yeah, dork."" Anyway, so I told her.Stella Diaz: No, that's not how it happened.Jose Diaz: [inaudible 00:17:42]Audrey Diaz: Let father finish.Stella Diaz: Okay.Jose Diaz: Then I asked her if she would marry me. Of course, her eyes got opened. She said she felt she was very blessed, and of course she said yes, so that's pretty much it. Not time to rebuttal. Let's move on.Audrey Diaz: Sorry, mom. He did rebut your story, so that's a wonderful story.Stella Diaz: We'll talk again.Audrey Diaz: So you've been married for 35 years. Just tell me some of the specifics of the date you were married and where.Stella Diaz: We got married at Saint Peter's Italian Catholic Church. The reason why we got married there was because I had promised by father I would be married there someday. My father and his brother helped build that church when they came to Los Angeles. In fact, I believe they have both names on a plaque in the back. It was just really, really special to me. I just told them, no matter what, I'm going to get married there, and we did, and it was just beautiful. The day we got married, they told me it was the hottest day of the year we got married, May 25th, 1974. I had a long sleeve winning gown,went up close, I think, it was up on my neck as well. I was not hot. It was amazing. There are some pictures of us standing outside and I just looked so cool. I was not hot and people were dying out there, but it was just amazing. A lot of the wedding preparations were, I can say now because I wouldn't ever tell my mom, but they were not what I wanted because I just wanted other things as most brides want what they want. But my mom being my mom [00:20:00] who she was, she wanted other things, and so I allowed her to do that and I figured, the bottom line was I was going to marry the man I loved and that was the bottom line for me. It didn't matter if we had this instead of that and whatever, so it really doesn't matter. So I was just happy, period. It was the best day, I think, in my life next to having my children. It really, really, really was.Audrey Diaz: So speaking of children, in 1974, you get your first, and I assume your favorite child. Tell me a little bit about how you felt when you heard the news or you learned of the news.Stella Diaz: I remember we had came back from vacation and I wasn't feeling well. I remember I kept having a stomach ache. What the heck. It was terrible. So your dad tells me, ""I think you should go to a doctor."" Yeah, I think so too. We didn't have a doctor at all. We had just gotten married and we were just, whatever. That was not in our plan yet, going to establish doctors and things like that. I think the doctors recommended to us and so I went, we both went, and sure enough, we were so many weeks ahead pregnant or whatever. I thought, ""Oh my God."" The thing was, how do we tell our families because we knew they were going to be excited. But then I knew that there was going to be a lot of tension between my mother. My mother was a tough lady, so I thought, ""Oh my gosh. Here we go."" Pretty much for the first, I guess, nine or 10 years of your life, my mom had a really tough time with sharing you, would the best way to say it. Sharing you with any other adult person.Audrey Diaz: Including you.Stella Diaz: No. Well, no. With other grandparents and other adult friends that we had and things like that. She wanted to have you all to herself.Audrey Diaz: So Dad, how did you feel when you heard the news that you were having a baby?Jose Diaz: It was unique. I mean, you hear about it when you're growing up, but when it's actually you, it felt very, very surreal, I guess. Then it started working on me. I said, ""Okay, I'm going to be a father."" When I did see you born, I got scared because I saw this little child and it's like, ""Oh my god, that child is my responsibility."" I remember being a child and I saw my parents never worry about anything, they were going to take care of me, never questioned it. Now, I was going to have this child. At least, an infant that was going to have that same kind of trust, and I just thought if I was ready. Not that I didn't want to, it was scary. But it worked out great. It worked out great.Audrey Diaz: What were some of the things that you hoped for your children and try to instill in your parenting styles and your structures that you had at the house? What was it that you wanted for your children, and you can now mention the other child that you have and when she was born.Stella Diaz: She does exist.Audrey Diaz: Yes.Stella Diaz: Her name is Nadia and she's three-and-a-half years younger than you. We almost didn't have her, you know that, right? We were just having so much fun with you.Audrey Diaz: Right. We really don't know why you had to have her, but that's okay, though.Stella Diaz: But we thought, I guess, we're all entitled to ourselves. No. We knew that we wanted more than one child. It was fun having just one child. I mean, we gave you all the attention we had and, of course, love. It was just really, really super the first three-and-a-half years. But then we thought, ""Wait a minute, I don't want her to grow up alone."" I did, and no, that's not fair. I mean, who's going to ride with her in Disneyland. Come on. I always worried about that. So there we go. We planned [00:25:00] and Nadia came around July 3rd, 1978. It was great, it was great. They always say your first child is your experiment. Oh, definitely. Because when Nadia came, so we knew it all. Didn't pay attention to her, we just left her there. She'll be fine. But it was great. One of our dreams was to have our children young, and still be young when they had children, and so on and so forth, because our parents were older. At least my parents were much older by the time I came around. My dad, he was very young at heart and he tried to play with me, and he did. God bless him. But when you guys came, when you girls came, well, you know how much we played with you. Dad, basketball, and biking, and all these fun things that we wanted to do as children, we were able to do with you and Nadia. For that, we were really blessed to have done that. By the way, the number one thing was the faith in our household, and that we really wanted to instill that because I feel that God is always been there to help me and to guide me when things were really, really rough, whether before I was married, during our marriage, and with you girls. I just feel you need that in your life and we wanted to instill that very, very early on, and I hope we accomplished that with you and Nadia. I really do. That's number one thing.Audrey Diaz: How about for you, daddy, anything additional to what mom said?Jose Diaz: I don't know if it's practical, I guess. I wanted to share those the same discipline, if you will, that was given to me by my parents, by respecting your elders. Not only your parents, but elders in general. So we try that to also be courteous; yes, thank you, not yeah. I think those are the little things that make a difference, at least to me and they still do, I think. If I see a child doing it now, it tells me that there's a certain level of respect, I guess, as a society. I think those are still good values to install. I think we tried to do that, and again, it's an experiment growing up as a parent also. You want your kids to behave, if you will, but you also have to behave. Because you can tell them all day how they should be but if you're not doing it. I think that was a challenge.  I didn't realize that parenting meant that you also had to parent yourself, if you will. You don't want them to use bad words, well, then you better not use bad words. You don't want to be impatient, well, then you got to be patient. Those are always very challenging. I do agree with mom, the center of our life has been try to live a faith, ourselves, and then share that with our children.Audrey Diaz: Now, I remember being raised with a big emphasis on education. What were your hopes for Nadia and I as far as education and what you thought education would give us?Jose Diaz: If you don't mind, I'll take that one. It's interesting. You're right, and I think that came because coming from Mexico for myself. I went in Mexico, I mean, Tijuana for two years. At that age, I didn't understand all the economics but I knew one thing that there was other kids that their parents hadn't enough money to send them to private school. Even then I used to hear, if you have a good education, you'll go further in life and you have more choices, if you will. Maybe I didn't understand all of that. So when I came to this country, I did see that, I experienced that. [00:30:00] You had your own pencils and you had your own books. In Mexico, you had to buy it. I remember I had to get money from my uncles and my aunts for that. But here, wow, they give it to you. That to me was like, ""Jeez, I should study."" I mean, they give them to me. Anyways, education was very important. So yeah, we made that, you're correct, a goal because we knew that that would open up more opportunities, especially with girls. I knew that at that time, not that I was going to create a feminist movement with my daughters, but I knew that there's some extra challenges that I can see for females.Audrey Diaz: Mom, where did your daughters end up going and doing?Stella Diaz: Well, let's see. Well, the first one, well, actually, they both did. But lets talk about Audrey. She left home and when she went to college and that was hard for me, although that's what I wanted in terms of you choosing where you wanted to go. It was difficult, and that was a lot of sleepless nights keeping your data. What if this, what if that. Are we letting her go? Should we let her go? But it's not our decision anymore. It was who we raised you to be and in making your own decisions, and that's what you wanted and we had to let it go. Whether you made it or you didn't , we were always going to be there to support you and I believe we were. It was a lot easier when Nadia went, of course, because you were back home. So it's okay. It's Nadia's turn to go. Those weren't schools to sneeze on. I have to say in my family because I know little bit of my biological family. You girls were the first ones to have gone to Ivy League schools and graduate with a Master's. I take a lot of pride in that. However, I wasn't the one doing the work. I wasn't the one that had to leave home. I was one to stay at home and prayed and just worried. But nevertheless, when I see you girls out there doing what you do, what you love to do, just so much pride and just makes me so happy that you're not settling and you're doing what you want to do, and I'm very happy about that.Audrey Diaz: What's been the saddest moment in your life?Jose Diaz: Well, I think the saddest moment is always when we lose a loved one. We lost grandpa Disty, we lost grandma Gloria, we lost grandma Rose. So there's always said Mom touched about the fact that when you girls left to college, there's an emptiness, emptiness window, even though we were very proud of both of you as an emptiness. So those were the saddest. Everything else is good.Audrey Diaz: Mommy.Stella Diaz: I think it's happy and sad. It's bittersweet when something wonderful, like your upcoming wedding next week, there's so many people that I love that will not be there, my mom, my dad, your grandpa, your grandpa, my brother who had so much pride in you, girls, he won't be there, your grandma, dears, just so many people. It's bittersweet because I'm so happy to see you because you're happy and it's just wonderful and I want them to be there and see how happy you are and how happy we are. It makes me sad that they're not there. I get upset, but it's just one of those things and I'll never forget what Kyle, Nadia's husband, said to me when Hayden, their only son, was baptized last year. His mother passed away a year [00:35:00] after they got married, and she wasn't there for the baptism, of course, but he hugged me and he said, ""Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here with Hayden and for being his grandma."" It was sad, but it was a beautiful time in their lives and being baptized, and I knew he missed his mom, and I missed her too not being there. So that's it. It happens with the happiness.Audrey Diaz: Well, the two of you should have a legacy and myself and Nadia. Your current three grandchildren probably more, Issabella, Rose, Hayden, Joaquin, and Alexandra, Encarnacion, how would you like to be remembered by them and those to come? Then we'll wrap up. You have two minutes.Stella Diaz: I think I'd like for them to remember how much we loved them, how much we love them now and always. Just remember as is always happy and loving and  always being there. As I tell Issabella now, if times get tough for you, just pray, and I will say the same thing to Hayden and to little Lulu, Alex because that's how I got through tough times and good times, and I hope they all remember that, all of them. Those ones are the ones after them. I hope I'm here for them too.Audrey Diaz: Daddy.Jose Diaz: I hope I remember that my life is one that I show that I'm very optimistic. I like to think I'm optimistic in that for them never to give up on anything that life challenges them because there's always another day and there's a lot of good things to live for and to trust their families, and I hope that my family will always challenge themselves to love each other. Not always easy, but it's worth it.Audrey Diaz: Well, thank you for taking the time to talk to all of us today. Is there anything else you want to say?Stella Diaz: No. Are you happy?Audrey Diaz: Absolutely.Jose Diaz: Why are you happy?Audrey Diaz: Why am I happy? Because I have everything I want. I really do and all my key people are still alive.Stella Diaz: Okay, thank you.Audrey Diaz: Thank you.Stella Diaz: Thank you.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
MBY006347,"Daniella:	[00:00:00] I'm Daniella Simonovic. I'm 26. Today is March 28, 2010, and we are in Fresno, California and I am interviewing my mother and my father.Jimena:	I'm Jimena Simonovic. I'm 54, oh my goodness, and today is March 28th. We're in Fresno and we are here because Daniella wanted us to be part of this project.Lysenko:	I'm Lysenko Simonovic. I'm 56. Everybody call me Blas. Today is March 28, 2010. We're in Fresno, California at this time, and Daniella is my beautiful daughter that she had the initiative to have us here for this interview.Daniella:	Okay. So my first question is tell us how we got to Fresno, California from Chile, and maybe what was your first memory about being here in the first couple of months that we were in the United States?Lysenko:	You want me?Daniella:	Both, together.Lysenko:	Well, why we end up in Fresno is a long story but-Daniella:	Well, how we ended up in the United States?Lysenko:	In the United States of America, at least for me, probably was a dream since I was a little kid because I was crazy fan for John Kennedy. I remember being a little kid and asking my parents to read me about John Kennedy. I think everything's started from there. I have that connection with this country. I don't know if my other life have some other connections there, but then with time I became a teenager and I was probably 18 or around there. I had this crazy feeling of coming here. I remember that time Veronica and Alejandro were in New York, my cousins, and I contact with them all the time, and I think they got tired of me. I wanted to come to see them but they were telling me it's difficult, you need to get your visa, and it's difficult to come to this country anyway, so my dad totally opposed to that. You're going to go there and watch beaches. That's not the place to go for you. Then with time for some reason, you want me to continue what I'm saying?Daniella:	Yeah.Lysenko:	Then with time for some reason, I end up going to physical therapy school and I didn't know that physical therapy will bring me to this country. I don't know, it's like destiny put me with that profession. I was in Chile, finished my career in 1978, and then opportunities for us as a physical therapist were really poor. I beg people to hire me. Finally my dad, because he wanted to help us since my brother and sister also were therapists, gave us opportunity to open a practice and it was so difficult to live in the environment at that time in Chile. Then for five years I was able to develop something there in terms of work, but it was difficult even for Jimena, as a doctor, it was not easy to find a good job. It was, I think, my idea to come to this country. Well, I knew there was a good opportunity, am I standing too much? I don't know. It's okay.Jimena:	Well, I think what happened was that for you we had the opportunity to come, because in Chile things were getting difficult with the new land, a bit little. It was hard to plan ahead with the economy the way it was going. So we went to Miami and as I could remember, we went for a visit and, I went to the hospital to see an interview with a pediatrician. While I was in there, Blas was walking around and he went to visit the physical therapy department. Believe it or not, for the medical professional was [00:05:00] very difficult to come at the time and Blas was just being nice and going with me. He got offered to apply for a job and he saw that the opportunities for being physical therapy and coming here were actually big, right?Lysenko:	Yeah, when we came to Miami because we didn't have so much money then. I had this patient of mine. He worked for DHL. It was an American courier company. Then they use people to carry the mail. Then through him, we had a chance to come to Miami. In fact, we had to travel in different days of traveling, and then that's how because I knew there was an opportunity for therapists in the United States that's how we came. Then I went to different hospitals. We went to different hospitals. Everybody was looking for therapy, they want to hire you right away, and that's how the story started. We went back to Chile and immediately I started all the process to apply. Then at the same time, Domino was, my brother, he was trying to come here for many years and decided that he wanted to come with me too. Then we started the whole process together, applying to take the test and that's how we, at the end, finally, after a long process of sending paperwork here, we were able to come to take the test which was not easy, because you needed to get a tourist visa to come over here. Because the legality to come to the United States is just the only way you can do as a tourist, very difficult to come and say that you want to work here. They will not give you a visa to come. That's how we started.Jimena:	But what is funny or interesting is that we wanted to leave Chile and go someplace. We had a very good friend, very dear that was living in Switzerland. So we started studying French to go to Switzerland. So we studied French for like six months.Lysenko:	That's true I think, yeah.Jimena:	To go with Pablo and then we end up in the United States with, well, my English, it get 100 percent or close, but it's funny, we end up speaking English and we started studying French. So that's life.Lysenko:	That's true and I had forgotten that step of the process. But I think like Jimena was saying earlier, the desire to emigrate was coming from the family because like me in my case, my grandparents, my grandfather was the one that traveled from Yugoslavia to Chile first.Daniella:	Okay.Lysenko:	As an immigrant over there in South America. Then everything's started from there. We are in some way gypsies .Daniella:	And mum, your family too, right? They're pirates?Lysenko:	Oh yeah, my maternal grandfather. I think his family came from Spain because his last name is Varo, V-A-R-O but he always wanted to say that his grandparents were pirates and he descend from a family of pirates that came to Chile.Daniella:	So what was it like the first couple of months our whole family was here?Lysenko:	Well, first, I came by myself with my brother, then that was the difficult stage of the process. I was here for six months probably and then very stressful. Well, because in the whole process we didn't know so many people, then I met these friends Marisol and Natalio well, through a patient of mine, by the way. But she came from Chile to California because I asked her to, she was coming to California and asked her to bring me books to study for the examination that we had to take here. Then she came over and she couldn't find the books and then so well, but over there I met this lady, Marisol. She's from Chile, she's living in California and she's coming in a few months here to Chile, and that's how we met Marisol in Chile. She came to our house, brought the books and everything, and then she was really nice to offer her home when we were coming [00:10:00] back to take the test. Then we arrived to California and she was going to pick up us there, picked me and my brother. My brother bringing tons of luggages and we were there waiting. We didn't know what happening. Well, finally she showed up and we came to her home and then she had to go out of town then she left us in the house and she just took off to the coast. Then we were, me and Tommy, we didn't know what to do over there. We're answering phone calls that we didn't know who was calling. In Los Angeles not having a car, you cannot go anywhere, it's so difficult. But then the whole process started over there and then a few weeks later, we had to take this test on that was April 18. I never want to forget that we came here on April 13. We arrived to the country. April 18, I was-Jimena:	19-Lysenko:	1984.Jimena:	1984.Lysenko:	Then in between my brother got sick before the test, he got kidney stones. He was so very dramatic after, even though he was really interesting, he was a big challenge. Well, the first few weeks when we do the test, then at the hotel where we taking the test was a job fair where all the hospital from California where they're looking for people to hire. Then we got offers from everybody, and that's how the whole process started. We were still going to all these places that we they gave us a business card or they wanted to talk to us and we went all the way from San Diego to San Francisco, every single hospital. Finally, to make the story short, we end up staying in Alamitos Belmont in Long Beach, California, where the people were so incredibly nice. They receive us like we were family. That's how my heart was more open to his country from the moment in all day. The working place was their ideal working place. Christopher Derby, the director, he was such a nice person and very single person in that place. I remember we were looking for place to live. It was so hard because we didn't have credit in this country. Then no one would rent you a place if you didn't have any credit history.Daniella:	So where was the first house?Lysenko:	Me and my brother, we ended up living in a hotel for a little while. Daniella:	Where was the first house that we came to?Lysenko:	Well, it was in Lakewood, California. Fortunately, the person that the landlord or the owner of the house was a Vietnamese guy.Jimena:	Niugen.Lysenko:	Niugen.Jimena:	Yeah. I remember.Lysenko:	A very in a nice man.Jimena:	He was nice. He was very nice.Lysenko:	Then he understood the whole problem about immigrants coming here. The history of credit, you know, how then he was open and willing to rent the house to us, and that was a first house in Lakewood, California and I lived there before going to Chile to bring your mom, and you, and Carolina. Then they told us that the we could go for the interview for a Green Card to Chile will take us a few weeks. We rent this house already and we were living there. Then, we were going back to Chile for a few weeks to get the Green Card. But meantime, something happened in between Chile and United States relationships in between the two countries, they start breaking and they slow down the whole process. Instead of staying in Chile for a few weeks I end up staying six months. But at the same time we met a couple from Chile, a doctor. They wanted to come here. They came here for a fellowship and they're looking for a house to rent and they offered a house to them to stay for a few weeks while I was going to Chile, he was going for six month. Destiny put everything together, and then I told them, ""Look, you can stay for the six months [00:15:00] because I'm not going to be able to come back from Chile."" He was exactly six months when we were called to do the interview. These people came back from here, California to Santiago with a house key. The next day we took the plane back to California.Daniella:	All four of us?Lysenko:	The four of us, in Avianca. That 's when your mom then she came, was part of the story there.Jimena:	Well, you know, I think, you don't understand, but usually, life is so special that everything is happen for a reason. To me being on the mom side, to me, the most important thing where my kids and the family, and so Carolina was four years old when we came here and then Daniella was almost two, she wasn't two, and things like to, find a good school. We were lucky to find a bilingual school. Teacher was very nice with Carolina for the kindergarten. Then Daniella, she was speaking fluently in Spanish, and then we move to a country where you speak English, she got a little confusing. Sometimes you will make up words just to keep talking, like [inaudible 00:16:27] . It was very difficult also to find a preschool for here where she could feel comfortable, while I could go to the college and take English classes, because even though we have English in Chile, it's not the same as social English, and so-Lysenko:	I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when we start working, me and my brother, after a few weeks they hire us to work in the hospital and the patients, we had to communicate with them in English and they would talk to us. We couldn't understand a word what they were saying. So many times I went to Chris, then direct to tell him I don't know if I can do this, you know. Then it was quite challenge, for JJimena, that was challenge because at least I has some basic English but your mom, she never had a chance to really practice English before coming then it was a little harder.Jimena:	Yeah. Because, you know, I enroll in an institute just to have conversations, but then my own thinking we're going to move. I have a grandmother that I adore and sometime I had to decide afterward either do I go to see my grandma or do I come to English classes? I said, well, if I'm going to move to the States, I am going to have the English there, so I will of course just go visit grandma and talk to her and be with her. For me, I don't think it was that difficult taking the decision on staying home because in Chile was working as a pediatrician. We had some help in the house with the kids. It was change, a complete change of life coming from Chile here.. Stay home, stay with the kids, and you don't have the family, you don't have cousin, you don't have anybody. You just have friends that you have to keep them in or develop relationships that they end up being your family later. The main thing was having the kids being comfortable and don't have the feeling of missing the family or missing something and try to develop like a language.Lysenko:	It was so easy here too in some ways, because, like California when bilingual State in some ways, despite the people don't want to see that. We have friends who were so incredible like [inaudible 00:19:18] . He want to pick us at the airport. That was like five o'clock in the morning. He was waiting for us in his little car. We couldn't even fit the luggage. We almost couldn't even fit us inside the car. Then they're these people speak Spanish, then Marisol then we have all these friends that we start meeting here. They became family for us.Jimena:	Well, yeah like-Lysenko:	Then you guys start growing here. Carolina went to school here shortly start speaking English, you too, you were little. I think it was harder for us to get the language [00:20:00] than it was for you, you and Carolina. Six months you were having friends.Jimena:	But I remember the first day that Blas went to work and I stay home alone with two girls and then suddenly the doorbell rings and I said, "" Oh, who can it be? I don't know anybody here?"" I opened the door and there was this beautiful blonde American girl with blue eyes with the big basket with fresh fruits.Lysenko:	That was Joyce.Jimena:	That was Joyce. She talked to me in Spanish the whole time because she knew. We still keep in touch and she is Michelle's godmother. We're lucky to have that people in our life because she is being a great friend of all the time.Lysenko:	I think like in my life, everything happened that way. Something that I follows, some energy that I follow takes me to places. I remember when we had to sell the place to work with my brother. He wanted to go to San Francisco, I wanted to stay in Long Beach. He said, ""This is a place, I want"" for some reason it's the place I wanted to start working. Then he's, well, it's up to you. You can decide you want to go to San Francisco. You stay here with me here. At the end he stayed with me. But then everybody in that place, Joyce, Chris, Adela, and so many others that work in there, that was our beginning in this country was they did a house warming for us. Anything that we needed, it was brought to our house. That was before, that was when me and Tommy were living in the house. It was such an incredible experience. We never experienced something like that in Chile, such a great welcome. For us it now means a new life.Jimena:	I just want to mention two experiences that show you what difference you can find it in the two countries. I mean, for one thing, when we first tried to go to the bank and open an account in Chile. I was a pediatrician and I was Dr. JJimena Navarrete, that's my single name. Even though I was married, I work with my single name. Your dad was Blas [inaudible 00:22:34]. When we went to the bank and we tried to open an account with two different last name, they were so confused, so upset, and I think we couldn't do it. We just have to put JJimena [inaudible 00:22:48] . For me, being a professional and being always JJimena Navarrete, it was such to big change of mine, to have a different last name that I was not used to having. That was in 1985. Then they did a big fuss when Hillary Clinton wanted to start using her single name. In Chile we had always use our single name even if we get married, we keep it and we add both. The other thing that I wanted to share with you is I love coffee for breakfast and I love tea for the tea time. So the first time that I went to the supermarket to buy a coffee, I go looking through the aisle for the coffee. Well, when I went to the coffee aisle, it was a huge, huge aisle full of coffee, different kind of coffee, grains, no grains, instant coffee, different brands, that was so choking. I mean I had so many choices that I was overwhelmed and I didn't pick any. I went home with no coffee. It was too much. I couldn't take it.Lysenko:	We went through all those challenges.Daniella:	What were the funniest challenges? Funny stories?Lysenko:	I don't remember.Jimena:	Well, driving. I remember driving in Long Beach. I was going to San Pedro. We used to go to Mother's Beach in Long Beach. Then I wanted to go to San Pedro. For some reason, I had to go and I was driving and I was going on the bridge and suddenly I don't know why I got scared about going in the bridge and it was going high, high, high and then suddenly decided no, I cannot do this anymore. I don't know where I'm going to go on the other side of the bridge, so I just turned in the [00:25:00] middle of the bridge.Lysenko:	No.Jimena:	I turned back.Lysenko:	That part I know.Daniella:	Twenty years ago?Jimena:	What was incredible for me is that everybody just stopped, nobody honk, nobody screamed at me, nobody yell, everybody just let me do this craziness about turning in the bridge. Then when I came back and I park and we went to the beach I said, ""That was so stupid of me."" But I admire all the people respecting my decision on going back, so everybody stop and everybody let me do my thing and nobody.Lysenko:	Yeah, that's one of the most impressive things I believe because in our country we say we're nice people and all that, but the concept of respect sometimes too far away. The considerable respect here, it was something that really learn how to receive that and to become also the same here. Then it's funny, but when you go back to Chile, then you realize, oh my goodness.Jimena:	It's a big change.Lysenko:	It's a big change. Then so many things. There's funny things happening in working with the English language too. So many funny things, but I cannot tell all them here.Jimena:	One thing that really impressed me is the respect for the people here. I mean in Chile you cannot go into a hotel if you don't look right. Here you can go anywhere as long as you have shoes and a shirt. But what impressed me the most was on the funerals. When people die and they are going from the church to the cemetery, there is a police motorcycle starting with the-Daniella:	Procession?Jimena:	Yeah, with the procession. Then at that time in Los Angeles where we lived, even if you're going to freeway, nobody will go in between and that person goes to the cemetery with the police motorcycle in the beginning and one at the end of the procession and I thought that there was such a respect for that individual's life. That impressed me.Lysenko:	I was so worried when we move here because of you and Carolina growing in this country, but that was at the first month. After two, three months, I felt so good that you were here for some reason. I start seeing the benefits of we all coming here. I feel like I belong to this place here. I don't feel like even coming back to Chile other than visiting and that's my feeling at least. But when I look back, when I see you how far you have reached here and Carolina and-Daniella:	Michelle and [inaudible 00:28:45] .Lysenko:	Michelle and [inaudible 00:28:46] , I feel like, oh, that was the right decision that we made to come over here because it's not easy to be an immigrant. It's not easy. We came here when we were 30 years old already, it's a huge change in life. I tried to imagine how it's for other people because I got it easy in some way of how the profession that was needed here and in the process, it was easy. But I don't know how other people can do it when they have to come here and really start from nothing and sometimes not even be able to get their legality. It's so uncomfortable to be in that stage. But hopefully because this country, I feel like he can give much more and can provide that to other people the same way that it was provided to us because it makes love this country more when you're legal.Jimena:	Well, for you it was easier than me. I mean, they needed physical therapists, they didn't need doctors, so I had to take so many tests and they were so difficult, [00:30:00] especially for the foreigners, they were more difficult. The passing grade for the foreigner was at 20 percent. For the Americans, which I understand, it was 80 percent passing score. But I think when you go to Rome do as the Romans. So I think for the kids, the school, the system, it gives you so many opportunities. The thing is you have to work and you have to work for them. You have to work hard and then you get a reward at the end. There are many options here. Sometimes it's sad to see that young people they don't have more aspirations, although they don't work as hard as they could.Daniella:	Well.Lysenko:	But yeah. I think everything was a plus coming here, and I feel we have accomplished something in life that not so many people do because it's a huge decision, especially when you have two kids.Jimena:	Well, now four.Lysenko:	Four now, but by the time we moved here, you were little kids, and then it's just to say, okay, I think it was right what we did, and nothing is perfect. But -Jimena:	Well, I think it was right what you did because you wanted to come.Lysenko:	Yeah. I really wanted to come, that's for sure.Jimena:	Yeah.Lysenko:	Yeah. I'm glad that your mom was able to support me in that because she was losing more, and in some ways, because she didn't probably need to come over here. But I think at the end, I think you realize also that was a good decision, I think.Jimena:	Yeah, it was.Lysenko:	You would like to change some things that are happening in the country, but that's the story of each country.Daniella:	So for Michelle and Dawar, what's one thing, in just one thought or something, that since they were born here in Fresno that you would want them to know about your decision to come here and what you want for them, each of you?Lysenko:	Well, it's true and I have talked to you, sometimes we forget about Dawar and Michelle. They were born here, and then the story for them is different. Sometimes I feel like we're missing a little bit their connection with the family and the backgrounds from Chile, which is important. I think they were not part of the story in 1984, their story start here, later. But I think they feel that they are, in some way, immigrants, in some way, because belonging to parents that are immigrants. For them, growing with you and Carolina, I think you have transferred more of that part to them that probably we done.Jimena:	Well, I think it's very important that they have the interest to keep the language and we emphasize always that the fact to be bilingual is very important. So you don't lose your connection with your roots and with your family.Lysenko:	My message for Dawar and Michelle, is like-Jimena:	Issa.Lysenko:	Issa, that they are here because one day, we decided that it was good to move to this country, and we are here growing, and who knows who'll be the future. But today, we are here and everything happened 25 years ago when we decide to move here and-Jimena:	They have to keep working because it's not easy in everything. You can you can fulfill your dreams if you work hard and don't loose your faith.Daniella:	Thank you, guys. Thank you for coming today on Sunday.Lysenko:	We're so happy to do this for you because you really wanted to hear this.Jimena:	Our little butterfly.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask a question just before you guys end?Lysenko:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	I was wondering Daniella if you wanted to talk a little bit?Jimena:	Oh, yeah.Lysenko:	Yeah. She's an immigrant too.FEMALE_1:	Yeah. What's your experience been like? Do you remember the first years?Daniella:	[00:35:00] I have a lot of memories when we were living in Long Beach, and I think I remember being on the bridge with you that day, Mom. Yeah. It's been fun to be able to watch the different phases of our family here and see you guys.Jimena:	We love you so much, and we love also Dawar and Michelle. One thing that's always happen in our family when we talk, is that they said,""Oh, Mom, you are so sweet with Dawar and Michelle, or you're spending too much money with them, or you are treating them different."" Ten years apart, Dawar and Michelle, and one thing is the language is getting better. We speak a little better English now, at least me, myself. Then I don't feel so shy to talk to other people and mingle with the kids' friends. So that's make a big difference, so you can get into the society and be more like you belong.Lysenko:	So Danni, how you feel to be here with us?Daniella:	I feel proud. I feel happy. I thank you because you built such a good community around us and I know that it was hard being away from my family. I'm glad that we got to go to Chile when we were growing up, every two or three years because sometimes I feel like, I'm neither from there or here. I feel like, I'm really from both places. You guys let us see the best and the worst of both worlds. I remember all the Saturdays in Los Angeles, and when we moved here going to all the parties with all the other Chilenos, all the Colombianos, everybody around. Then listening to you guys drink wine all night and talk about politics and this country and what it was like. I don't know.Lysenko:	I wanted to ask something. I pick this profession because I was strongly influenced by my father.Jimena:	He must be happy. He must be happy seeing everybody growing up happy here because the kids are finding their way. They are going to university. They're working and we keep them-Lysenko:	No. It was hard because I didn't know where I was going in life, but then he was so strong about me going to school. It's true, when you're a kid, sometimes you don't value that, but then when you are old, you look back. There's so many things that my family provide to me, my father, my grandparents, even though we didn't have a mother because she died so young. But all the things that they provide to us allow me to be here because I hated to go to a British school and learn English. English was a nightmare for me. But then look, I end up here and this is my main language right now. It was interesting. I think it's good to value the past.Daniella:	Thank you, guys, for bringing us here, and thank you, Mom, for all the sacrifices I know you made for us, staying home and putting your career on hold and going through everything you went through. Thank you, Dad and Mom, for making that decision to come here. Your dad made the decision that changed your life to bring us here. I think you guys have opened so many doors for all of us here in this country and for our lives. We love you guys.Jimena:	We love too.Lysenko:	We love too, honey.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
MBY006380,"Naomi Guerrero:	[00:00:00] Hello. My name is Naomi Guerrero . I'm 50 years old. Today is April 10th, 2010, Fresno, California, and I'm here with my sister, Lydia.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. Good morning. My name is Lydia Milano. I'm age 52 and today's April 10th, 2010. I'm here in Fresno, California, Arte Americas, and I'm here with my sister, Naomi. Well, first of all, thank you, Naomi, for coming. It was a tight squeeze trying to get to Parlier from the Sanger to pick you up. I had to put gas  this morning. I always wait till the last minute for everything.Naomi Guerrero:	But we made it. That's great.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. I was speeding a little bit there on that freeway. I just wanted to say that one of the very first things that I always think about is that one time dad said, [inaudible 00:01:04] I had you guys here in the United States because it's really poor over there in Mexico where they lived.Naomi Guerrero:	Yeah, and despite it all, he really did a lot for us. Provided for us and brought us up to be productive citizens, which is something that we will forever be thankful for.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. He gave us the motivation. A wonderful father. Worked really hard. Both parents from Mexico, first-generation here. It was hard.Naomi Guerrero:	I think we have a lot to be proud of our parents because they instilled in us values. They instilled in us the value of integrity and work ethic and just really, really making sure that we grew up to really good citizens and stick to those values and morals that they instilled in us from a very young age.Lydia Milano:	Despite the fact that both mom and dad in Mexico, maybe if lucky, third grade education.Naomi Guerrero:	Dad six grade. But he came here, he went to school. He did his citizenship and learned the language and was the only breadwinner for the family. Despite it all, he made time for that and emphasized education. Was very proud that we all pursued our education. That's something that will [inaudible 00:02:55] .Lydia Milano:	While working out there in the field that's hard. Being the first one, the first child going out there, I said not for me. I'm going to continue school and dad said, okay, despite being so traditional.Naomi Guerrero:	But do you think that that in and of itself helped you want to really pursue going to school and getting a career because we knew what it was like to be out there working in the fields.Lydia Milano:	Especially a woman out there in the field. Morning is so cold, those vineyards. The leaves wetting your clothes, and then the hot sun in the afternoon. I wanted to die at 3:00. Three o'clock, I wanted to die. But he did a lot. Mom is just a housewife at home and not just a housewife. That's a lot to do.Naomi Guerrero:	One thing that I really when I think back, I think while mom, third grade education in Mexico, but she learned, she was well read. I remember her reading books, always looking at magazines or books and then also making cookies for us. I think mom read a recipe in order to make those peanut butter cookies or oatmeal cookies. She had to read a recipe and she did. We would come home from school and well, that was great. Peanut butter cookies.Lydia Milano:	Especially because you were always hungry and I wish you could have ate my food because I hated breakfast. I just hated to eat that stuff in the morning.Naomi Guerrero:	Those were good memories.Lydia Milano:	We just had grandfathers. One in Mexico and one in Texas. But our trips out there three days, three full days, two nights nonstop. Just go-go-go and [00:05:00] never really stopping at a restaurant. That one time we stopped at that restaurant and dad ordered eggs. I don't know. We couldn't afford it. You were just looking around like you wanted more.Naomi Guerrero:	I ate that egg in no time and was ready for the next thing. There was nothing there.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. We grew up with not too much, but happy. Now we're okay. Everything's good. Work hard and 40-hour jobs. I think sometimes you put in more than 40 hours.Naomi Guerrero:	But I think that our childhood really, our formative years when I look back at it, yes, we did without, but I think that that kind of that makes us value what we have today and our parents and what they did for us. That's a really good thing.Lydia Milano:	I always remember how when it rained dad couldn't go to work and he'd be looking out the door. ""My goodness, I'm not going to get paid."" There's no such thing as annual leave, vacation time, sick leave, nothing like that. He'd just be so worried because he was the only one that worked and four kids and only that drove, only one that knew English, when we were little. Talking about English, being the first one not knowing any English when I went to school. We'd watch cartoons and stuff, but I don't think I knew fluent English. Just have a word here and there. At that time when I got to school, the kids said, ""You can't speak Spanish in school. What are you doing? You're going to get in trouble."" I said, ""Well, what do I speak?"" That's all my parents spoke to me. Spanish. But now, when you went to school, I was already there. So I was already learning and by the time you went, do you remember it being a little easier for you?Naomi Guerrero:	Easier because you had sort of paved the way for us and we we were able to go into the school with more of an advantage than when you went in and it was a little bit more challenging for you.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. Then our brother, Esaias, by then he already knew a lot of English. Then we started growing up and just started speaking more English to each other and mom would get upset and say [inaudible 00:08:08] you have to speak Spanish here. Well, I'd say, ""Mom we learned English now. We want to a speak English. Mom would always want to have us speaking all Spanish and eating tortillas. You have to eat tortillas because you're Mexican. I don't want to eat those corn tortillas. I don't like them. I'd rather eat the flour should make them for us every day after school. With butter and everything.Naomi Guerrero:	What's interesting is that when our sister Alice was born, 13 years later, 11 years after I was born.Lydia Milano:	A whole different world.Naomi Guerrero:	Nine years after Esaias was born, she grew up in a totally different environment. I remember thinking when we were already teenagers and working. I don't want her to go through what we went through. So I would give her some extra money to purchase some clothes that was in style. I wanted to do that for her so that she wouldn't have to be embarrassed going to school with funky little shoes or whatever, the things that we normally had to wear because dad couldn't really afford much. I don't know if that was a good thing or it was not such a good thing.Lydia Milano:	I don't think Naomi. What do you think Naomi? Look at the way she's shaped. Look at the way she is. She's way different.Naomi Guerrero:	But it was a different upbringing altogether because she had our influence, which is different.Lydia Milano:	She had the best toys. [00:10:00] I think I have one Barbie in my whole childhood. Alice had a whole suitcase full of them. Well, you more than me of course. She's closer to you because you used to really spoil her rotten. Now you spoil her little one. Our niece. But it's hard. It's painful when you think about when you're so poor.Naomi Guerrero:	My dad always had a roof over our head and he always provided for us. He was very responsible in the sense that he did not live check to check. He saved the little he could and he always had that cushion for a rainy day. We never turned off our electricity or we don't have food on the table. He always provided for us.Lydia Milano:	No welfare.Naomi Guerrero:	No welfare. That's one of the things that I appreciate really in the values that he instilled in us that we learn to make an honest living and not depend on the system. To this day, he's is still with the with his health insurance and a supplemental that he pays.Lydia Milano:	You'll never catch him say, I can't pay the phone bill this month or I can't pay the electricity. He always did provide, even if it was just beans and rice.Naomi Guerrero:	But he did. So that's a good memory and good thing that he did for us.MALE_1:	Can I ask you a quick question?Lydia Milano:	Yeah.MALE_1:	What did your father do?Lydia Milano:	Field work labor.MALE_1:	Where?Naomi Guerrero:	Farm worker in Parlier for many years, same employer.Lydia Milano:	Farm worker for 30 plus years. Our brother Isiah, 30 years in the Navy, Master Chief. He just retired and he's getting a really good retirement. Left to the Navy right after the high school and served the country for 30 years.Naomi Guerrero:	That was a difficult thing especially for mom to deal with because he was the only son and he left right when he graduated from high school. So that was a very difficult transition for her.Lydia Milano:	Especially because mom was used to the Mexico ways that the children stay at home until they get married and that's it. When I first started going to Reedley College, every day when I come home from classes, she'd say, ""Why are you going over there? Stay home. A woman's place is at home to be a housewife, and a mother, and that's it."" I'd say, ""Mom, why do you tell me that? I want a higher education. Looking  for our people are at? If we're over here just going to continue that trend, we're never going to get anywhere, our people."" It's that you listen to those friends of yours that say, ""Oh, no. A woman shouldn't be out there alone in a car going to school. She'd probably do another thing. You shouldn't let her do that."" I'd say, ""Mom, look at all those other kids in the neighborhood. How many of those kids even finished high school?"" Just maybe 15, 16 right away elope with a boyfriend and have four or five kids and that's it. So I said, ""Mom, no, no, no, I want to go to school."" Then then Naomi, you said, ""Now I have to go too, just because you went.""Naomi Guerrero:	I followed in your footsteps.Lydia Milano:	So we both we did. We graduated from Fresno State and my brother in the navy, he also got his four-year degree.Naomi Guerrero:	Electronics.Lydia Milano:	Naomi and I got BAs. My youngest sister got her Masters. It's a wonderful thing to continue with higher education. I wish I had gone on a masters too, but I'm kind of stuck now, [00:15:00] 52.Naomi Guerrero:	You can still go back to school. Yeah.Lydia Milano:	It's never too late, but now I'm married and have to work 40 hours and marriage and everything is quite a task.Naomi Guerrero:	In retrospective, have any regrets?Lydia Milano:	On what?Naomi Guerrero:	On the way we grew up or the way that your life has ventured?Lydia Milano:	Well, the only regret I have is when I graduated with a BA, I was still single and I should have just continued on with a masters so that way I could have gotten a better job. I'm not complaining about my job, I do love it. I've been there 25 years at the Fresno County Library. It's a very rewarding job. You know that too, Naomi because you worked at one time for the library as well.Naomi Guerrero:	I continued doing part-time work for them.Lydia Milano:	Yeah.Naomi Guerrero:	But I think my job and working with the migrant families, I think can really identify with them and I think that the way I grew up, I can really empathize with what their challenges are. Although these are different times, there's a lot of similarities, and I feel very fortunate to be able to give back to the community that I grew up in and to be able to instill the education and literacy and really promote that in what I do. Because that is something that will carry and help these children through their educational levels.Lydia Milano:	Especially that group. To me, the people that you work with, the families that you work with, I see them and I just right away picture mom and dad and when they were raising us. The kids not knowing too much English, and dad speaking English, but not too much and mom nothing.Naomi Guerrero:	It brings back memories of our parents.Lydia Milano:	Oh, yeah. It brings back memories of how we started off and how they're starting off, and of course, at the library, when I see Spanish speakers coming in, I always try and go out of my way to explain to them what public library services are because they don't know.Naomi Guerrero:	To make them feel that this is something that they can access, that it's okay not to feel intimidated by the system, that it's there for them and it's a free service. It reminds me of going with mom and helping her to interpret thing for her and how it was just always that process where you were, and you really never realized. Well, this is something new to her. She's never been in a mall because most of her life she spent in that little rural community of Parlier, in that little house and that was it. When we went out to go to school, well, every day you're exposed to new experiences, but in reality, think about her even today. Her world is very limited. So some of the things that she talks about is because she's really not had exposure to much.Lydia Milano:	But too, Naomi, she settled for that. That's one of the things that I have a hard time understanding. Why a person would settle for just being stuck in there. Well, okay, she's comfortable there. That little community, Parlier, California is almost like the little Mexico now. It's just all Spanish speakers.Naomi Guerrero:	It's a comfort zone.Lydia Milano:	So it's very comforting there for her. Anywhere she goes, all she sees is people that speak all Spanish and everything. So she's comfortable in [00:20:00] that little world. Okay mother's 70 what? Seventy-four now? Never learned English, never learned how to drive, comfy in that little environment, but then sometimes she gets frustrated and wishes she could, you know, ""Well, I can't do this, I can't do that. I'm very limited."" Well, she kind of built that little nest there. It's fine, but at the same time it just brings you down. Well, I'm pretty independent. I didn't get married till I was 29, okay.Naomi Guerrero:	But that might my work for her.Lydia Milano:	Yeah.Lydia Milano:	I agree with.Naomi Guerrero:	What it is the most important lesson that we learned in our lives?Lydia Milano:	In our lives? What's the most important lesson in our lives? Well, I think to be like you said, give something back to the community, be good citizens, learn as much as we can learn, and help people, that's my jam to help people.Naomi Guerrero:	Never to give up to always strive.Lydia Milano:	Never give up and think optimistic.Naomi Guerrero:	Be positive.Lydia Milano:	Because if you don't think optimistic, your life is always going to have that great cloud under you, and I don't like that. I always try forget and forgive and just go on like you tell Andrea, your daughter.Naomi Guerrero:	Moving forward.Lydia Milano:	Don't dwell on things just move forward. Somebody was mean to you or rude, don't dwell on it just go forward. I always try and be nice to people because I feel like I want people to be nice to me. I always think of how would you like to be treated, you treat them the same.Naomi Guerrero:	Do unto others.Lydia Milano:	Yeah, you treat them the same, and dad always told us that too. Don't be fighting at school, don't be mean, don't talk back to people. Well, that's sarcastic.Naomi Guerrero:	But he is.Lydia Milano:	He can be a little on the sarcastic side at times, but he means well. We always talk about mom and dad in our lives and everything, but right now, I'm thinking about that just talking. I think people if they were to hear our conversation, they would think that we put a lot of emphasis on dad and mother's being going through a little, I don't know what her problem is these days, but she told me flat out the other day, [inaudible 00:23:06] and I said, ""Mom, how could you even say that?"" Well, dad has his personality lends themselves to he's a little more bubbly entropy and mother's always depressed about something. So obviously, who do you want to hang out with? Who do you want to talk to?Naomi Guerrero:	Well, I guess it's because he influenced her life in a more positive way that you tend to bring him up a lot more and it's really not that you favor one over the other one because, I mean, we love our parents both. But in the sense of being influenced in a positive way, and you tend to congregate towards people that make you feel better than making you feel like you-Lydia Milano:	Your self-esteem.Naomi Guerrero:	-to contribute.Lydia Milano:	Boost your self-esteem.Naomi Guerrero:	Absolutely.Lydia Milano:	We don't really get that too much from mama, it's more dad. He's always, ""Oh good, you did that, oh wonderful you did this."" When I graduated from eighth grade, he gave me a watch, and I don't think mother gave me anything.Naomi Guerrero:	But it was from both I'm sure.Lydia Milano:	No, he just might sign a card from both, but it's him. Every birthday, he gives us a little birthday card. When we were growing up, we didn't have birthday party. Do remember our birthday party?Naomi Guerrero:	Not really.Lydia Milano:	You don't remember eating any cake? No? I don't think we ever had a birthday party. But my graduation eighth grade, first one, first for his child so he did [00:25:00] give me that little watch, and I still have it.Naomi Guerrero:	What does it look like?Lydia Milano:	It's like gold, it has little Roman numerals. I think he bought it at Kmart because that's any place where he used to go to is Kmart.Naomi Guerrero:	Remember we saw the Rocky Johnson and those ring-Lydia Milano:	All those wrist lace at Cape Martin and the Blueline Sale. We'd go to Parlor to Fresno is about what? 25 miles or sopa. We would only go come to Fresno maybe once every, what? Six months or something because it was too expensive to go.Naomi Guerrero:	That was special.Lydia Milano:	We'd be in the little car, and they'd be listening to eight tracks; those Spanish accordion music and stuff, we'd be clowning around in the back seat.Naomi Guerrero:	That reminds me when we're talking about daddy, when it rained it didn't work, and how he would want to take us to school so we wouldn't get wet.Lydia Milano:	Yeah.Naomi Guerrero:	We didn't really want him to because his car would backfire. He'll drop us off, and we were hoping that wouldn't park-.Lydia Milano:	Park to close.Naomi Guerrero:	-Really close. By that time, we were in high school so very embarrassing it would backfire.Lydia Milano:	Like leave us here in the corner somewhere please because your car is a scandalous. He'd warm up the car, he'd turn it on, and put the heater on so that his little kids would be warm.Naomi Guerrero:	My goodness the car seat or seat belt laws weren't in because the whole crew went to school in their back seat.Lydia Milano:	But see, Elisa, by that time, we had to drop her off in her first day of kindergarten. Both of us walking because dad didn't have time, he couldn't leave work, and mother was not going to go because she didn't speak English. So there we go. We were in high school when Elisa started kindergarten. We walked over there to the-.Naomi Guerrero:	To drop her off?Lydia Milano:	- to elementary School.Naomi Guerrero:	Which is about a half a mile.Lydia Milano:	Half a mile and then we went across town to the high school. When we were leaving mother made her little braids. Mother said she could didn't know how to comb girl's hair. She made her two little braids. I remember looking back. Elisa was about five, she was trying to act real brave like, ""It's okay, you can leave me here.""Naomi Guerrero:	You could hear her little voice cracking because she was, ""Bye"".Lydia Milano:	""It's okay, you can leave me, bye."" We're like, why do we have to do this? Bye. We're like crying on our way back.Naomi Guerrero:	Knot in our throat. Remember, when the picture day, mom went and look for a little blouse and found cute little blouse.Lydia Milano:	But took her a long time to find that blouse for her.Naomi Guerrero:	At Kmart, her little sweater was bundled all the way to her neck. When the picture came back.Lydia Milano:	When the picture came mother said [inaudible 00:28:28].Naomi Guerrero:	Never took off the sweater.Lydia Milano:	She never took off the sweater, and she buttoned is all the way to the top.Naomi Guerrero:	So much for the blouse.Lydia Milano:	Yeah.Naomi Guerrero:	But those are good memories.Lydia Milano:	Our baby sister, nine pounds, nine ounces, we have to take care of her. Mom got pretty sick. She's like 4' 10"" her height, and then she had that last one, nine pounds, nine ounces, almost 10 pound sack of potatoes, oh my gosh.Naomi Guerrero:	Her mom was a fatigue little thing-Lydia Milano:	She got so sick, and we had to help her take care of Elisa. Now, Elisa has the one daughter and it took a long time her to mother would say, ""When am I ever going to have grandkids?"". Well, we were busy studying. We weren't getting married soon, not until we've finished, and mom is, ""You guys never get married. Oh, my goodness, I going to have grandkids may die before I even see one."".Naomi Guerrero:	I was 25 when I had Andrea.Lydia Milano:	Twenty-five or 26?Naomi Guerrero:	Twenty-six.Lydia Milano:	Twenty-six. Then you had Andrea and then I got married at 29. Didn't have any kids. Then Andrea was already 15 when Elisa got married and [00:30:00] she waited a few years. Well, she waited a few years and then Andrea was already 15 and then Elisa had her daughter. So those two cousins, Andrea babysits her little cousin who right now is nine.Naomi Guerrero:	Yes.Lydia Milano:	Andrea is 25. Mother is like, ""I have to wait 15 years to have a second grandchild. Oh, my goodness. I'm getting old."".Naomi Guerrero:	But there is a good wrap-up, it's their generation.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. I always tell people, we're like that. We are the true melting pot of America because we've got Elisa married a white guy and my brother married a Japanese from Japan. He has two little daughters that came here to visit and they're speaking to my mom in Japanese.Naomi Guerrero:	They're trilingual, they speak English, Japanese, and Spanish.Lydia Milano:	Mom saying, wait a minute, I don't even know English now as it much less Japanese. Good grief. Then Caitlin know Spanish, and Andrea, fully bilingual, the oldest granddaughter.Naomi Guerrero:	Yeah.Lydia Milano:	We've got an interesting family. We do all the things that have happened and all the things we've lived through and we're still, to me Naomi, I think we're still sometimes have a little problem. I mean, we're assimilated I mean, we were born here. I was born in Texas, everybody else was born in Fresno, but still living in two worlds because mom just Spanish and dad real traditional Macho Man, Mr. Machista. He's still up to this status and just living two, it's hard to-Naomi Guerrero:	Live in two worlds.Lydia Milano:	Yeah, to live in two worlds. It can get tricky at times.Naomi Guerrero:	But it's all part of the big picture.Lydia Milano:	Yeah. Well, I don't know, I'm happy to. I never regret.Naomi Guerrero:	No regrets.Lydia Milano:	Being poor or being Mexican or Mexican-American. To me, life goes on and you just have to make the best of it. I don't know about you.Naomi Guerrero:	I embrace culture, I embraced it all. I think you can gain a lot from a diverse world and I think we're very fortunate living in the San Joaquin Valley, that we live in communities that are so diverse and then we've been able to experience it and value family, which is number one.Lydia Milano:	We are a small family, typically Mexican families have a lot of kids. So we're just four kids. We were three for the longest time. The little one was a surprise. That was a little surprise there, but I'm glad that I speak Spanish. I get a little rusty because that's how we just speak all English. It's all English. Sometimes I get a little rusty. One day I couldn't remember how to say cabbage in Spanish and mother was like, ""Oh, I don't believe you."".Naomi Guerrero:	Insult to injury. But Michael, your husband, well, he's like fourth generation.Lydia Milano:	Fourth generation, yeah. We were first generation, what can I say? He says, I wish I could speak Spanish, but his Spanish, he doesn't like to really, not too much.Naomi Guerrero:	Well, I think we had some good conversation.Lydia Milano:	Yeah.Naomi Guerrero:	I appreciate that you're my sister and that we always get to talk about anything.Lydia Milano:	Yeah, I know. I think well, I'm the oldest and then you're two years younger and then my brother and I think we're pretty close. You have a good rapport with the younger sister.Naomi Guerrero:	Because you're more like a daughter than a sister that's why.Lydia Milano:	Spoiled daughter. Yeah. But you and I, [00:35:00] it's always together whether we.Naomi Guerrero:	We could have been above Bobbsey Twins.Lydia Milano:	Yeah, you're right.Naomi Guerrero:	Pretty much, that says it all. But you know what? It's good because we don't have to be the same and where our personalities clash, but we're able to get through our differences and always be there for each other.Lydia Milano:	Well, all of us have always respected each other and we've always got along. We're not like those families. I told my mom we're not going to do that. The other day when she had that little fit. I told her we're not going to do that. Like some families that don't speak to each other for 10 years or something. No way. We always try and get together whenever we can and we're close.MALE_1:	Well, I actually just have a quick question. What are your parents names?Naomi Guerrero:	My father's Jose Gomez and my mom's [inaudible 00:35:57] Gomez.MALE_1:	Is there anything you want at the end that your nieces, nephews, and future generations that you want them to know about? Just about your family and how.Lydia Milano:	Well, just that to appreciate life and they have it a lot better and no resentment or anything, but they've got a better life and all due to all the struggles, stemmed from dad and mom and all their struggles to make a better life for all of us.Naomi Guerrero:	Just to keep the family alive, to keep in touch to know who your genealogy to know who your family is. That's about it.Lydia Milano:	We're a small family.Naomi Guerrero:	Thank you.Lydia Milano:	Thank you for.Naomi Guerrero:	Sharing.Lydia Milano:	Yeah, for sharing everything. And we still have some more to talk about on the way back to Parlier.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
MBY006388,"Stella:	[00:00:00] My name is Stella Galvan. I am 36 years old. Today's April 11th, 2010. We're here in Fresno, California, and the relationship to my partner is my father.Jose Angel:	[inaudible 00:00:15]Stella:	So one of the first questions I want to begin with is where were you born?Jose Angel:	In San Antonio, Texas, Bear County. They call it Bear County now but the X is still there. It's actually like John Wayne said, [inaudible 00:00:53]Stella:	Interesting, and did you grow up there?Jose Angel:	No, I was about four years old when they brought me to California. I grew up on the west side of Fresno County, out where our pipe goes now, out that way. We had to walk to the bus where the bus picked us up and went to school. We had to go a little over a mile. The only time we didn't go to school when it rained because the mud out there in the west side, the more you walk in it the more it packs under your shoes, and it's real slippery because it's a lot of clay. But we walk over there every morning and every afternoon, went home. It was a different kind of life it is like now because we lived in labor camps. There were a hundred cabins in each labor camp. The big ones and small ones had 10 or 15 cabins. But it was a different life because everything was cheaper. A dollar was worth a dollar. Now it's a lot  less. Stella:	Right.Jose Angel:	But we didn't pay any rent, we didn't pay light or water. The only thing we paid was for the gas, for the stove. When I was five, six years old was my mom used to use kerosene stove, and I buy a gallon of kerosene for $0.20 or something like that. Later on we went to butane and then we had a 20 gallon tank that we put in a truck or a car, we'll ride in and take it down to home to get filled up and bring it in, cook it up again.Stella:	But during this time you were still living in labor camps?Jose Angel:	Yes. Yes.Stella:	Okay.Jose Angel:	We lived out there in labor camps until I was 14 years old.Stella:	So since you were four years old to 14 years old?Jose Angel:	Right. Myself went work after school, when the cotton season where they let us pick cotton close to where we lived and stack it in one of the cabins next to us. We pick everyday during the week, and then on Saturday, I'd fill up all the sacks and go weigh it, and then pick the rest of the day.Stella:	So is that people had turns, like the kids had turns, if you went to school in the morning.Jose Angel:	Yeah. There was another labor camp, where was that? In Bellman and Douglas, it was called resource camp. We went to a school house. It was close to the labor camp. The older kids would go in the morning. The first, second, and third went in the evening and afternoon, and the other one's; fourth, fifth, and sixth went in the morning, and we'd go pick cotton when there's cotton season was. At 11 o'clock, the truck would go out and pick us all the kids out there, went to school in the afternoon and bring us in, and we'd get ready, cleanup and all that. Take a shower. That same truck would take them out to the older ones to go pick cotton in the afternoon. That's the way it was. In the summertime what we did for money, there was no [00:05:00] refrigeration and all that. Maybe there was, but we didn't know it at the time there. We'd make wooden wagons and go to a store. We would go around the labor camp.Stella:	You just would make it? I mean, you guys would just get together and just, whatever wood. Yeah.Jose Angel:	Right. Each one had one. You'd get one of those wood boxes.Stella:	Like a crate?Jose Angel:	Yeah, and then find some tubing and make the axles, and get some wheels, and put them on there.Stella:	How old were you when you were doing this thing?Jose Angel:	I don't know, about eight years old. That's how we got by in the summertime. We go to houses and ask if they need any ice. They'll say, ""Yeah, I need some ice."" We'd go get the ice, they give us the money. A block of ice were like $0.15 or something like that. They gave us a quarter and we'll go get the ice.Stella:	Delivery.Jose Angel:	Yeah, we deliver it and when we deliver it, they give us $0.10. With $0.10 you could buy a soda. Soda was like $0.06, and then buy candy bars, something else. We had it made all that day. But that's how we did in the summertime.Stella:	Would be other families living there, obviously in the labor camps but you had relatives also living there?Jose Angel:	Sometimes we had relatives, yeah. They'd come from Texas and spend the season working in the labor camps, in the fields and all that, whatever. It was during the early part of May and June after the cotton came out, and they do chopping cotton. Then afterwards we'd come to Biola, from over there from the west side to have a change of pace. We come to Biola and pick grapes. When the grape season was over, we'd go back, and then they say, ""You still want to go with the hauling of weeds in the cotton or you want to pick cotton?"" We had a choice, and whatever it was they chose that's what we did. But at that time, there was a lot of people come from all over; Texas, Arizona, New Mexico.Stella:	Migrating.Jose Angel:	Southern California. Yeah, following the crops where it was. I get a kick out of this because somebody would come from Texas, they meet a girl from Arizona or somewhere else and they fall in love, and they get married, or they run away. If you were the guy and then take that bride back to where he was from, and then the following year, they come back, they have a little baby. But that's how the mixture of different families get together. I see them once in a while. They have a movie that depicts all that.Stella:	La Bamba did.Jose Angel:	Yeah, there you go.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	That depict that.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	We used to go to Hollister to pick apricots, and as kids, we'd work with the women. You just cut them in half and put them on these wooden boards where they stuck them in the oven, so forth. So they dry them out or something, which were called [inaudible 00:08:14] That's what we knew what they were.FEMALE_1:	Who run the labor camps?Jose Angel:	It was dependent. Like the west side it was mostly big, not big ranch enough. Back where I grew up, the name of the gentleman is Russell Giffin. He had gins from Los Banos all the way down to almost Five Points. Some of those are still there, but they use them for something else, to store something or they use them for a different kind of package. They got them out, all these stuff out and they use the building. Russell Giffin had different sons, they were in different labor camps. One of the sons was Murphy, and then another one, I can't remember all of them, because it's two, three sons, and then Mrs. Peck was a daughter of Russell Giffin.Stella:	The same Peck's from [inaudible 00:09:26] ?Jose Angel:	Right, in Peck ranch.Stella:	Oh, wow.Jose Angel:	So they'd have evolve it to their family thing, but Russell Giffin went broke one time. One time he would doing real good and then he went broke. I don't know what happened. He asked the people to work for him. When he came up again, he would pay him for a lot of time. They might work one season or two, freebie. They'd give some money to eat, but as far as getting in a pay.Stella:	The actual pay.Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	But when he came back, [00:10:00] he started producing again, they got paid.Stella:	He kept his word.Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	But there was people out there at places that they work. They were already tired, but they still go work. I remember one time, this foreman, he was a new foreman, he wanted to fire some people that were there. They would just show up, but they wouldn't do nothing really. But they were so used to doing something that they didn't, and they still got paid because they worked for him when he was down. So he covered for them until they died. So I said, ""Hey"" They told the foreman, ""They will fire you first before they fire them."" But it was a different kind of lifestyle.Stella:	How much were people getting paid during that time?Jose Angel:	Well, if you pick cotton, it was $0.03 a pound, so a 100 pounds was three dollars. The most ever pick was another person with 500 pounds. I think two or three days I did that and I never did it again because he was a good picker and I'd go with him. We'd take three rows, had a center one, and I had mine and he had his. He had that center, we'd both pick out of the center one. Every time he'd beat me with two or three pounds, every time we went to weigh the sacks, he'd come out always ahead of  me and I could never do it. I do it real fast, and I think it's still big. Life was different, it was slower. There was no criminal element like it is now. You leave your house open, nobody would go in there. Somebody wouldn't bother it.Stella:	This was during the 1950s?Jose Angel:	Yeah, the early '50s. I remember one time we were coming from Texas, I went with my uncle and we slept next to the road right there. In the morning, my uncle says, ""Hey, go get some wood branches from different trees like that and make a fire on the side of road, and put a pot of water, and as soon as it started boiling, throw some coffee in there, grounds."" Coffee is ready, bring up the sweet bread and drink coffee and everybody's happy. But we slept right next to the road, nobody would bother you. Everybody was doing it.Stella:	I mean, discriminations always existed. I'm sure during that time, you guys sensed it as well, but how do you see it different from now?Jose Angel:	I experienced that. We were in another town we were going to Texas, and we went through its highway, Interstate 10 now, but at that time, it was little roads, the two lane roads. We stopped at, I think, it was Van Horn, I'm not sure, Van Horn, Texas. With me and my cousin went into a restaurant and we were just going to order coffee and walk out, just to go. We sat there for 20 minutes and nobody, like we weren't there. I told my cousin, ""Hey, you know what? They're not going to serve us.""Stella:	How old were you during this time?Jose Angel:	By that time I was 18. They're not going to serve us, lets go. We walked on. Now we go through there, ""Hey, come on in."" Every time we stop by Van Horn, ""Yeah, sure, come on. What do you want?"" It's all different.Stella:	You remember during that time where you were just not going to be looked at basically,  ignored.Jose Angel:	Yeah. It's a weird feeling when you're invisible or they ignore you and you feel it. I imagine everybody that's been through that, it's an awful feeling.Stella:	Right.Jose Angel:	Matter of fact, I was listening to an abortion thing this morning, and it's true, like you are non-existent as far as we're all be weighed right now. A baby is non-existent. They had no rights. That's weird.Stella:	But during that time living in a labor camps, when you live in there, you didn't feel it there in the labor camps itself it was just like everybody.Jose Angel:	No. Everybody was the same ethnic groups. Well, they're different, they're whites, blacks, Hispanics or Mexican, American. But everybody was striving to just have a better life. You go to work and enjoy everyday as it was. The only time we took a day off is if it was raining during that cotton season. If it was raining, you take a day off because they don't want you to pick cotton that was wet and they had to be dried. Cause it's double your pocket. It's not that it weighs more, but, I mean, if they pack it in there, [00:15:00] it will spoil because there's wetness in there, and they press it there and there's a heat. It produces heat and that's what makes it smell like it's rotten. I found that out later on just before I retired because I was hauling cotton modules. If they left them out there too long, they start getting hot. Some guy had to go check those things everyday and stack a big old, what do you call it? Heat meter. Meters you check the- Stella:	How moist it is.Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	A moisture meter. I pick up some that were [inaudible 00:15:40] that were sitting, had water around it and the sooner you picked that up man, that thing was rotten and that mean that the seeds were sprouting and it smelled real bad like it was rotten. But it's a thing that is shared on the cotton and you can't have it wet.Stella:	Well, one of the things, I enjoyed growing up out in the country, and I'm sure because it had a maybe more creative, and as you were sharing earlier that somthing you guys did as well, living in the county, had to think, well, what are we going do? How are we going to make money being creative? During that time, did you ever get in trouble with the kids there, you guys there were mischievous and because you had it?Jose Angel:	Well, it was a friendly thing, but we always during the rainy season, we'd have have fights with different gangs, but it was just like playful thing. We'd make balls out of mud and throw it at each other like a warring faction one against the other but it was just a fun thing. There was no feelings about it. But it was a fun thing. We throw those mud balls at each other and after it was over everybody went home or whatever, we do something else. We'd make our own kites out of whatever sticks we can find and newspaper. Stella:	That's so cool. But you also say your name so proudly was Jose Angel Galvan Polanco. So to that, I mean, who are your parents?Jose Angel:	On my dad's side, I never grew with him because I grew up with a step-dad, but this past year I went at distant relatives. They were cousin of my mom, I found out. I'd ask her, I sat her down, and I asked her, I want to know why, because one of the times I went over there and visited, she says, I'm the one to blame for this. She's the one that kidnapped us. So this time we're just less two years ago we went over there and I ask her, I want to know why and she told me. She told me that my grandmother on my dad's side would treat my mom with [inaudible 00:18:13] feelings she wanted to be the boss in all this, and I guess my grandfather, my mother's dad didn't like that, and so we got to take her away, because she might get hurt. So my grandmother or my dad's mom didn't know. She knew everybody in the family. So my grandfather shows her she was his niece if she would do that because she used to work for the government and I don't know if they're FBI or what, but she always carried a 45 in her waist. She was used to guns. So my grandfather went over to ask her and say, Can you do them this favor? I want you to do this. So they rented a car and stopped the car right in front of my grandmother's house, and then they says, ""What happened?"" ""Well, the car broke down."" ""Well, let me go inside and make some coffee, a pot of coffee."" While she was doing that, she grabbed me and my sister, and my other brother wasn't born yet, and put us in the car and took off. By the time she came out with the coffee we were gone.Stella:	Everything was planned?Jose Angel:	Yeah.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	I didn't meet her till I was 18.Stella:	When they kidnapped you?Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	But as far as I know, my dad was Antonio Galvan and with my mom's side, she was Paula Polanco Gloria. My grandmother was Alvina Gloria from [00:20:00] the Gloria family from Mexico. As far as I know, her dad was a [inaudible 00:20:06] , had lands and all that. They say that he used to put [inaudible 00:20:10] out there in the sun and lay the money out so it gets sun and air and all that. I asked my grandmother, ""How come you didn't go back to your roots and get what it was coming to you?"" She said, ""No, I left it to my nephews."" So I've been three generation, may be four, since then. As far as I know, all the Glorias live there. They had a [inaudible 00:20:38]Stella:	What part of Mexico?Jose Angel:	[inaudible 00:20:44] In town they had, I guess my grandfather had land there too, but apparently it's like six blocks on that town, and they'd all belongs to the Glorias.Stella:	Wow.Jose Angel:	My grandfather was from the same city. I would ask him, how do you do, because my grandmother was a person that they took her to church in a wagon or what are those?Stella:	Carriage or something?Jose Angel:	Yeah. She either went with her grandmother or la nana, which is the one that was taking care of her and him being from the other side of the tracks or the lower-class because he was just Stella:	Your grandfather, yeah.Jose Angel:	How did you do it, you could get together with my grandmother and she was well-to-do? I answer, Well, we find our tricks. He never told me, he will just say, well, we found our tricks. But apparently she was 19 and he was mid-twenties when they got married. I remember when he died, and it was December 3rd, 1967. My grandmother when she found out because she wasn't there in the hospital at that time but when they told her whoever got home, and they told her, all I could remember is her saying, I still remember this, What am I going to do without him? What am I going to do without him? I mean, they been married like over 60 years and, it's a long time and I can understand that because you get used to a person and you can't be without him. Like me, I taste different cooking from different people but your mom's cooking to me is the best.Stella:	Right. So how long after did she live after he passed?Jose Angel:	She lived 12 more years. She would have lived, I think, more longer, but one of my aunt, she says, I'm going to take care of mom and all this and she kept everybody out. She didn't want anybody near her. So we were away from our grandmother for the last five or six years, but she died on the 29th of November, 12 years afterwards. Three or four more days would have been exactly 12 years.Stella:	So you said earlier that you didn't really grow up with your dad.Jose Angel:	No, without.Stella:	Without him, which means you are close to your mom?Jose Angel:	Yes.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	My mom was like, I don't know, she was always treating me like I was something special, and I felt that love that warrants and all that. A matter of fact, she had that for you too when you were small and she'd see your baby shoes are scratched. Take my granddaughter, get her new shoes. She never wanted you to have to scratched shoes or anything.Stella:	She never wanted me to even wash dishes. I remember. Yeah.Jose Angel:	Yeah. Well, that's the way she was with me than I was just like to him. So you are somebody special to her too.Stella:	She was special.Jose Angel:	She was all love to anybody. Anybody, she would say, go over there and ask her, could you do this for me? I need to go to the doctor, can you take a cheap coin and take him? Till she stopped driving. I'm losing my sight, so I don't want to drive no more.Stella:	She was a go-getter.Jose Angel:	Yes.Stella:	She had, I remember, always in her truck driving back and forth, going in.Jose Angel:	Sometimes she'll come to Fresno when my brother was building that house over there. She'd come to a Fresno 2-3 times a day to buy lumber or whatever. Stella:	With limited English,  [00:25:00] .Jose Angel:	Then again, she'd do to all that in between there she'd cook meals.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	I don't know, to me she was the greatest person. When she passed away I felt it. I cried and I was in my mid-thirties or so. But I didn't feel it that hard because every time I would be near her, I always enjoyed hugging her and that was me telling her what I felt.FEMALE_1:	What's her name?Jose Angel:	Her name was Paula Polanco.Stella:	That Glorias, right?FEMALE_1:	Do you remember any ways that she treated you like you were special? Estella said shoes and dishes. What did she do with you as a kid?Jose Angel:	Well, to me it's like my wife now. Anything I say, as far as if I want to have something to eat, ""Hey, honey I feel like enchiladas."" She'd go out of the way and do it, and that's the way with my mom too. Whenever, ""Hey, I feel like I want to eat a lemon pie."" She'd make the lemon pie.Stella:	Homemade lemon pie.Jose Angel:	Homemade, yeah.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	She'd make it.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	Things like that. As far as our enjoyment and then like I'll tell the kids that our Christmas is not like the Christmas is now. In the Labor times, they'd give us a toy, and then a bag with candies and peanuts and maybe an apple or an orange, and that was Christmas. I'd go out and get any one of those trees that I'd put it in the corner there, they'll say, this is a Christmas tree. That was it, they'd dry out in two or three days.Stella:	But that was a Christmas tree.Jose Angel:	That was a Christmas tree for me.Stella:	See that's when I talked about, that creativity that comes out when you're living in those conditions and still being grateful for what you have and living life as best you could.Jose Angel:	Right. That's true.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	Yeah, I decorated it with little balls of cotton or whatever. It was great, my mom would bake and then the holidays, Christmas time, she'd make tamale. Then during the New Year's Day, she'd make buñuelos, we still do.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	To me, it was really enjoyable growing up. I never had too much things growing up. Whatever I had, I worked for it. Where I worked was using that money to buy my school clothes, so that wouldn't burden on my parents. I started working at nine years old because I was always been big.Stella:	You always look older than you were?Jose Angel:	I work on summer was for my clothing, shoes, and all that the following year. There was nothing like now, everything's a commercial. Comes Christmas, I mean, before it was after Thanksgiving, they'd get out their Christmas thing decoration in the store, now, is not even before Halloween, they got all the stuff for Christmas.Stella:	Everything, yes. It became very commercialized. So what would you describe a perfect day when you're young? When you're growing up in the camps and stuff, what would be a good day for you?Jose Angel:	A good what?Stella:	A good day.Jose Angel:	Going to school or at home, or what?Stella:	At home.Jose Angel:	Well, I just come home, we'd be playing out there when we're kids all afternoon after school. I'd only come home were around the time, actually, was somewhat time to eat. Back then, everything was closed on Sundays. If you don't buy gas for your car or food, so Saturday night, you wouldn't get it until my Monday. Now, in Saturday, Sunday, holidays, all the stores are open. But back then, it wasn't. Everybody took off Sunday.Stella:	Right.Jose Angel:	Sometimes they say, ""Wow, let's go. We're going to go to a store."" There [00:30:00] was a 10, 12-mile drive from where we lived to Manota, and that was enjoyable. We'd go to the store or sometimes we would catch a movie. Downstairs it was English, and upstairs it was Spanish. Sometimes we have watched there and watched the Spanish or sometimes we watched the English. But that was it, the weekends. Then when TV came around in black and white, little tubes and all that, we'd go to the neighbors who had TV, be there couple of hours and watch TV with them. But it was a different type. It was enjoyable. To me, it was enjoyable because there was not the run around thing there is now that everything's nearby the clock and all that.Stella:	Right. There's never seems to be enough time.Jose Angel:	Now, it doesn't.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	I guess that's why your mom says, ""Oh, you're taking it easy today."" ""Hey, honey, I worked all my life.""Stella:	Right, nine years old.Jose Angel:	I was working 16 hours a day, I got to enjoy it now.Stella:	Wow. Well, for me listening, and I know we've had previous conversations as well, on you growing up yourself, but I think that has given me strength to and has inspired me in what I do, so I'm really grateful for that.Jose Angel:	Well, let's thank be to God that now I enjoy every day. Even though I hassle your mom about this or dad, but I feel more close to her now than when we're newlyweds.Stella:	Right.Jose Angel:	I tell her, ""If you go first, I won't be right behind you because I don't know if I can get by without you.""Stella:	Right.Jose Angel:	That's the way it is. You can die at certain age and everything seems to be moving slower, or you enjoy every day more or something. We'll see what happens in the future. Now, I got to look forward to the children getting married and all that.Stella:	We have two coming up.Jose Angel:	Yeah. At least one, but I don't know two.Stella:	I think it's two.Jose Angel:	Okay. So I got to look forward to that because I'll tell your mom and says, ""We've been married almost 40 years and now everybody that got married 10 years after us, they're already grandparents.""Stella:	They're already grandparents, yeah. We took it slow. So with that said, how would you like to be remembered? That's one question I've been wanting to ask you.Jose Angel:	I never thought of it, but I'd surely like to be remembered as somebody that cared, which I do. Every one of my children I love them as equal. But every one has a different way of looking at things. Matter of fact, I told you this a few years back, that I wanted to write a letter to each one just describing what I feel for them and what I think I wanted them to be or do, and maybe I'll still do it.Stella:	Yeah, that would be cool.Jose Angel:	So many letters, I don't know.Stella:	Right. That will be quite a few letters, but yeah, you can start now.Jose Angel:	If you were going to write one for Stella, what would you say?Jose Angel:	Wow. I'd have to really think about it. I guess wish for the best for her in whatever she does and let every day be enjoyable and be a thing of experience, that when today is gone, it'll never be this day again. It will be 2011 but it will never be 2010.Stella:	On April, it will never be again in April 11, 2010.Jose Angel:	No, it'll be gone. It'll be another year. Well, there are so many things we can say, but everyone has a different way of seeing what they do. Stella has a way of doing her thing and the other one has another way of doing it. Because the boys call me Joey, which your uncle Ruben started calling me Joey, and they picked that up when they were over there. They don't call me daddy, they just [00:35:00] call me Joey.Stella:	Yeah.Jose Angel:	But instead of calling their name, I just say Prietto, because they're both dark and they understand that whoever I'm talking to.Stella:	Yeah. You have a nickname for all of us.Jose Angel:	Yes.Stella:	Yeah, and mine?Jose Angel:	Preciosa.Stella:	There you go.Jose Angel:	Prietto which is Mike,.Stella:	Prietto 1 and Prietto 2.Jose Angel:	Yeah, right. Then Arvina is Princess, and then Eliseo was Prietto Damian, and Rebecca, the baby, she wanted to be Princess, ""You know you can't be Princess.""Stella:	It's already taken.Stella:	You're already something else. ""What am I? I want to be a Princess.""Jose Angel:	No, you're Jueta and you never take that away from you.Stella:	Yes. Sometimes we all ganged up with Arvina and say, ""How come you are the Princess?""Jose Angel:	I don't know. I don't know what happened. I mean, it just happened.Stella:	It's all good. We know you, love us. We love you too.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask you a question? You said that your father's giving you strength and thought you a lot. What's he taught you? Can you tell me please?Stella:	There's so many things, but one of the things is service to people. He just showed it earlier with his mom, now he's helping out and he got that from her.Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	So they passed that on my mom's. They're both the same in that way of always helping people. They've, in turn, pass that to me. Now, I'm always helping people. The work that I do is about that. It's a social justice organization which is to help people.Jose Angel:	Right.Stella:	I think that's something very valuable. It kept me humble too, and also a faith in God. The fact that you guys instilled that in me, I had been always very grateful for that, because no matter how things get bad, I know that there's stuff to look forward to and things will get better. This is the way life and live, just take the example that you gave about living in the labor camps, and you did the best that you could to make it as fun as you could. I do the same thing within my own life. Those kind of things has helped me. However it happened that you end up being here in the Central Valley, I'm a product of that and I'm very proud of that. I'm very proud of being from the Central Valley. So thank you for that.Jose Angel:	All right.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
MBY006526,"Diane Archuleta:	[00:00:00] Hello, my name is Diane Archuleta. I'm 65 years old. Today's date is May 21, 2010 and we are in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Land of Enchantment, USA.Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	My name is Willie in the English vernacular. My Spanish name is Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera, M-I-E-R-A. From Wilfredo, you get the derivative Willie. That's what I've been known as all my life, Willie. I am 73 years old. Today is May 21st, 2010 and our location is Albuquerque, New Mexico. Diane and I are boyfriend and girlfriend. She is interviewing me today. Like I said, I'm Jose Augustine. I always tell everybody that I was named Jose for my dad, I was named Augustine for my grandpa, and on my own I was named Wilfredo for Willie. I was born in Lyden, New Mexico, a little agricultural hamlet sit on the banks of the Rio Grande in Rio Arriba County, 20 miles west of Santa Fe, the capital, 10 miles north of Española, and it was a completely agriculture farm town. Even today, 2010, we don't have a post office, we don't have a grocery store, we don't have a service station. It's still agriculture as it was when my grandpa was born in 1865, my grandma in 1866. My grandparents on my dad side were Augustine Miera as I said, my grandma was Manuelita Valdez Miera, and both of them were from here. At that time, it wasn't called Lyden. That came about in the early 19th century when the Chile Line Express as we used to call it a small narrow-gauge railroad ran from Antonito, Colorado down through Tres Piedras alongside the Rio Grande to Española and even to Santa Fe. That was the only mode of transportation. At that time, they brought the mail so we had a little post office, and the last name of the postmaster was Lyden who was from the Northern European countries of Sweden and Holland. That's how we got our name, Lyden. Prior to that, it was called El Bosque, which is just like the bosques, the bank of the river, or any place there's water like that. Velarde is the only nearby town that has a post office across the river, who at that time in the 1800s was La Joya. The J is not pronounced, so it's oya, which means like a huge jar. It made a curve that's why it was called the jar, the water held up there. My grandparents had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven children. The first one was Maria Ignacia, who died at a very young age, and then Mateo Belarmino, Mateo Luarda, my dad, Belarmino Luarda Margarito, Mateo Leonides, and Maria Ignacia again. All of them lived to be 96, 94, 88, 88. They all lived to a ripe old age.MALE_1:	Willie, can I ask you a quick question? Did they all lived in Lyden as well?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	My [00:05:00] Uncle Leonides never married. He always lived in Lyden and he always took care of his mom, which was my grandma who took care of me, and she lived until 1948 when she passed away. My dad, I will be talking about him. He migrated to Utah and worked in the coal mines all his life. My Uncle Belarmino migrated to Durango, Colorado and they have up there the Silverton Durango Railroad which runs strictly through mountains and mountains. He worked there all his life on that road. Mateo Luarda lived in Lyden all her life. Mateo Maria Ignacia moved to a little town east of Lyden called Ojo Sarco, where she married Juan Pablo Martinez, and they themselves had about eight or nine kids. So they weren't that far away from Lyden. Like I said, my dad moved to Utah and I'll be coming after that. But my grandma's place was a little farm which included a corral. We had a mare, a horse, two pigs, chickens, cows. They used to plow maybe an acre or two of everything, you name it. Cantaloupes, watermelons, corn, beans, chili, vegetables, tomatoes, cucumbers, you name it. Everything was provided there. By the corral, they used to have a bigger cellar that went right into the mountains and you could put stuff away, cover it with straw, and have fresh tomatoes up until Christmas and January. They butchered their own meat, they dried it, they made jerky. The well that they had ran from a cold stream, ran about five feet away from the front door of the house. My grandma house was right there, my dad's house was next to it. I grew up with my uncle and my grandma, and I learned how to plow. My dad taught me everything about horses and cows and plowing until I was at least 10 years old when I could handle the plow myself and cover a whole acre and never have the horses step on a plant. They were so well-versed about doing their job.MALE_1:	Were you an adventurous kid or did that come as second nature to you? Was it hard for you?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	I was the outdoor guy. I was the color of our black horse that we had because I was out in the sunshine. My brother, I only had one brother, was the indoor type. He was very quiet like my mom, and he couldn't be outside too much because his cheeks would come out red like a tomato. But he was inside and he grew up in his future to be a surveying engineer for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, making roads and all of that from Salt Lake City to Grand Junction, Colorado, up and through over the mountains in the desert. I was the outdoor type. I was with the horses, I was with the chickens, I was with my dad. My dad used to put the harness and the horses start plowing and set me up on top. If I got tired, I slept up there on top of the horses while they went back and forth. I knew how to ride a horse. I didn't need a saddle, I didn't need a rope, and that's why I was always skinny. I was never fat in all my life until now that I'm old, and exercise was the thing about it. But I was going to talk about my grandma. Her yard was immaculate. Our houses were made of adobe. They had wooden beams, vigas. They had thick walls, we didn't have air conditioning, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have radio, we didn't have TV, we didn't have inside toilets or anything, [00:10:00] everything was outside up until the 1950's from that county. We used to have a radio, my uncle had that every now and then, if the moon was right, you could hear maybe a song in it. But the thing that I remember about the radio was it was maybe about as big as a shoe box. But the four batteries that it took were as big as four radios put together for each battery. The battery weigh more than I did, and we all spoke Spanish. So that when they started me in school, I flunked my first year, I had never heard that people talk a foreign language. They took me to school and everybody speaking English, and I had never heard anything like that in my life. It took me a year, but I finally learned it. Like I said, my uncles went to Colorado and that my uncle Leo stayed here with my grandma, and they used to shipped me back every summer because my dad wouldn't let me go to school here. I had to go to school in Utah. My dad did have the adventures, childhood that I didn't have. I had my points, but my dad, they took him like from Lyden up to the Northern part of New Mexico to the Charma area where they had railroad tracks, uncles and relatives. He was 17, you're going to start working and you're going to learn and they took him, and that was his beginning, from there, he went up into Utah and he started working in Bingham, Utah, which has the largest open pit mine in the United States of copper. That's where he worked, and he started working there for a few years, and then an uncle told him, ""We're freezing to death, working here in the open pit in the winter times. Let's go 50 miles South to Carbon County, helper price, where I grew up and let's go work in the coal mines."" They went down there in the '30s, and my dad after that. That's what his profession for the rest of his life. In the mines, they could go into work and work 10 miles, 15 miles, 20 miles underground in 70 degree temperature year-around, and working at t-shirt and not freeze to death like they used to do in the copper mines up in Bingham.MALE_1:	How was that, when your dad left? How old were you in that time?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	When they first took me to Utah, I just started school here in 1944 in Lyden. Velarde was the school across the river, and my dad called and told my mom, ""I have a house and everything, and you come on up here."" So they took me out of school after three months and took me to Utah after, and enrolled me, and I had no idea. They enrolled me at the end of May. I flunked the first grade. I still remember the teacher's name, [inaudible 00:13:32] Wall, who probably laughed within her breath. Because I used to call her Mrs. [inaudible 00:13:43] which is a Spanish name. I found out years later that her name was [inaudible 00:13:50] Wall, when I was in the service, I was in the atomic energy work and they had to do a security clearance on me and I saw her name. All the time, I thought that was [inaudible 00:14:08] for Spanish. Her name was [inaudible 00:14:10] Wall and she flunked me in the first grade. Before I get to that, they enrolled me in first grade in school. I had already learned catechism back in New Mexico in Spanish, but now they enrolled me in catechism in head for Utah in English, and I had no idea. The sisters were teaching me catechism and I was answering and I had no idea what they helped me, and they helped me, and they helped me. Plus, they also enrolled me in altar boy classes. Now, listen to this, I'm Spanish. I don't know English, but now they enrolled me in catechism, which is in Latin. The only good thing about being an altar boy is they used to pray, get on your knees, [00:15:00] and on the floor, they would have the words in Latin so you could read them. Being that I spoke Spanish, Latin in Spanish are almost the same. So I got away with that, and I flunked, I passed the second grade, passed catechism, and I got to be an altar boy, but now I'm learning English and I love in school. I've always loved school, and I don't miss a day in school now from the second through the 12th grade forever. I always went to school. I loved going to school, and we lived in an environment that contradicts everything that's going on today. Because in today's society, we have the immigration problems all over the United States, which we have had for the last 10 years. Well, this is nothing new. Immigration from New Mexico to Utah, to Colorado, to Montana, to Wyoming to California, has been going on for the last 100 years, a poor state that people were leaving, going to Colorado to work at tending sheep, working at cow ranches, working in the coal mines. Montana, Wyoming, biggest coal mines in the whole Western hemisphere other than Canada and West Virginia and going to Utah to work in the copper mines, work in the coal mines, working on the railroad. The minorities were there, the Indians from Gallup, the Spanish from Lyden, Rio Arriba, Santa Fe, Española, Peñasco. The Indians from Gallup working on the railroad, and the Italian people coming over from Italy working in the coal mines, the Germans, the Czechoslovakis, all of the minorities were migrating up there, and we all got accepted. Two years ago, I went to helper again to price to my 50th high school reunion. What's left of us that graduated in 1956, we're still friends. I grew up with the Mormons. I was accepted. I learned everything. My friends are still my friends then. I've never been pushed to join the Mormon Church. My friends were a every race color, and creed that you can imagine, and we were all immigrants, not just Spanish or Mexican that they have now or Latinos, whatever. We were from all nationalities and that is what was great. We lived, we worked, and that was great.MALE_1:	I have a quick question. You speak really highly of your grandmother, obviously because she, as you said helped raise you. I'm sure if she look like. What type of personality?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	That is beautiful. My grandma, my dad said that our ancestors came down through the, if you were to follow the route of the Spanish people not coming from the Caribbean or Mexico or that, there were a lot of Spanish people that came in through Florida to the Louisiana coast up through the planes through Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Northern New Mexico, which includes Clayton, New Mexico,  and down the Taos, New Mexico. My dad used to say that our [inaudible 00:18:50] side of the family and grandma's Valdez side of the family came down from Taos. My dad could speak Tiwa which is language of the Indian in the Taos Pueblo and that he spoke, because like I said a while ago, there was a lot of Indians that worked in Utah in the railroad and some stayed and worked in the mines, and my dad spoke with the ones that were from Taos, all of them in Tiwa, and my boys found out that, now that he was old because we took him to Red River for a weekend and we stopped in Taos to get some ice, and the boys came out of the store and grandpa didn't come out and I'm waiting, let's go and he says ""We can't, he's in there and he's surrounded by five or six Indian people, and they're asking him all kinds of questions, and he speaks Indian."" I said, ""I know."" He says, ""How come you never told us that."" It [00:20:00] just didn't cross my mind, but he's always spoken Indian, especially Tiwa from that. So that's when we found out. Because my grandma, if you could see the pictures that I had, I used to sleep with my grandma when I was little. They had our house here, we were right next door. You think I'm spoiled now, I was spoiled then. Then I had two sisters and they said that I was spoiled. I was. I was the first born. My mom spoiled me, my dad spoiled me, my grandma spoiled me, my uncle spoiled me. My dad looked Indian with the high cheekbones. He was only like 5'5"". My son, Randy is 6'4"". He has a high cheekbone. If you were to look at him, my dad looks like the imitation of my son because they look the same. But my dad was very dark skinned, I am dark skinned, my brother was white, my mom was white, my sister, Trini is dark like me, and my sister Ceci is white like my brother. But my grandma was black, very sunburn, probably worked outside all her life. But I never seen my grandma with a bright colored blouse, dress, anything like that. She was always dressed in a black dress that went from a priest color in her neck, to the rest of her body all her life. She would go from the house to three or four blocks away from where we're working in the field. She would have a basket on her head and be walking down the road or along to ditch bank to where we were working with a snack or a lunch. She was something else. She stands out. I have a pot, I don't know if she make it that I found under five feet of dirt. Along time after she died, that was handmade pottery, black, and it has a nicho. Nicho was, N-I-C-H-O like a little hole where it broke. But it was in the basement where I told you that we used to have under dirt. I was digging, and digging, and digging, and I found it. I don't know if she made it, or she brought it from Taos, but that thinks about to be over 100 years old now, and I still have it. My grandpa, I never got to meet him, he was gone after 1910. I don't see his name in the census no more. But my grandma lived until 1948. She was very interesting as was my dad because of all the places that he worked. A while before me, our mom and my dad had a baby called Trinidad. Trinidad is like Trinity in English. Tri, tripod, treaty, the Holy Trinity in the Catholic faith. But in the 1930's, Influenza epidemic swept the nation, and she was one of the victims as a two-year-old. Then I was born in 1937, and that I lived, so that's why they said I was the firstborn, but I really wasn't. I was the first boy. Then after that, three years later, my brother Orlando Margarito Arturo, also known as Pancho the sovereign engineer. He was born, and then five years later, Trini, which was a repetition of the first one that was born. Also, the name of my grandmother on my mother's side. Trini is like a nickname. Trinidad, T-R-N-I-D-A-D is the whole word, trinity. Then my sister Cecillia or Ceci. [00:25:00] Trini still lives in [inaudible 00:25:01] where we all went to school. My sister Cecillia lives in Costa Mesa, California. My son, Marty lives in Garden Grove, California. My two sons, Matthew and Randy live here in Albuquerque with me since my wife passed away in January 14th of 2008. My daughter is Kelly, who has two girls and a boy, Ashley, Miranda, and Colton Chase, and they live in Spring Valley in [inaudible 00:25:58] , Nashville in Tennessee.MALE_1:	Willie, do you have a favorite childhood memory?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	Favorite what?MALE_1:	Childhood memory.Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	Childhood memory? Favorite childhood memory is probably 100 of them because I started playing baseball when I was eight years old. I played junior high. I played community city. I played high school ball. I played junior college ball. I've played semi-football. I went to the service and I played all the time that I was in the service. Other than having my job with the implications of the Atomic Energy Department, I did my baseball for the service too. But I had a lot of memories. I told you a little while ago about my dad had a black mare and he ride stallion horses. The stallion horse, nobody could touch him. My dad could go out there and call him, put a saddle on him, and ride him, but nobody else could even get him to move or put it.MALE_1:	Do the horse got a name?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	Bole was his name. B-O-L-E, which is a name means like a red colored horse. Whatever we would call them in English. But Bole. But one day, my dad was in the kitchen having coffee before supper, and my mom was looking out the window, and she says, ""My goodness. Dad, come here."" I was standing right underneath the horse and trying to get to move over by the corral because there's no way that I can get on top of the horse from the ground. She says, ""That horse is going to step on him or hit him or something."" She says, ""Mom, that horse is not going to do anything to him. He already knows him."" ""What he's trying to do?"" He says, ""He's trying to move him up by the corral so he can jump up on the fence and then jump on the horse."" ""Yeah. But look at him. He walks underneath and he walks back."" He says, ""He's been doing that forever. The thing is, he's not afraid at the horse, and the horse is not afraid of him. He won't hurt him."" Until I finally got him over there and I got up on the fence and I jumped on it and I just stood there like if I was riding him and moving back and forth, and my mom's having a heart attack in there. Then finally, my dad comes out, he says, ""Can't you put the rope on him?"" He says, ""I can't reach that far."" He says, ""Here."" He threw it up and put the horse rope around his neck. Then all I was doing was going to move him about 10 feet around the gate and lock him in the corral. But I came in the house and my mom couldn't even talk. She says, ""Don't you ever do that again."" I says, ""Sure, mom. No, I won't do it."" You know, I was going to do it again. Not in front of her. Animals never hurt me. Football never hurt me. Baseball never hurt me. [00:30:00] I got more hurt playing basketball than anything else, and that's the way it was. But nothing serious. I went to the military. There was no NASA there. There was a language school in Monterey, California, and they sent me there because I didn't have any orders. They sent me there. What it was, I was a guinea pig for what was to become NASA later on, which was a program for the astronauts now. I was in that for a while until I finally got orders to go work for the army in the middle of the Mojave Desert, which is not as bad as it seems because out there and be known to people was JPL laboratories. That was what the precursor of the atomic energy stuff that was to become later prior to Vietnam. Lot of stuff going on, the coming of the X-15 rocket, which was sends up our rockets into space now to the moon. The invention and development of the  M15 tank, which was developed at that time. The M16 rifle, which became to be used a lot in Vietnam, and stuff like that. I had a most interesting career in the military for three years, and it was great. It was greatMALE_1:	I have a quick question, you said you are guinea pig, but what exactly?Jose Augustine Wilfredo Miera:	They were going to be sending people into space where there is no noise, where there is nothing, you're confined to a space maybe three feet by three feet, and they had us, guinea pigs, and they would put you in a room. You had a red button, anytime you want to get out, you could push it. You're going to be in here for the next 24 hours. They were guide, they would go in there. Six hours, they can't stand it no more to be confined, push the button. But if you completed what we were doing, when you got out, you had a three-day pass. Then we're going to do this, you're going to be in there for three days. Imagine being in space for three days, no noise, no nothing. They fed you, but they didn't feed you'd like the steaks that you're used to eating. Prepared foods, small portions, stuff like that. If you completed the three days, fine. If you completed a week, you might get off a whole month, stuff like that. In complete silence, no TV, no radio, no nothing. You slept, you think, you talk to yourself, you only had a little space, may be four feet by eight feet and it was controlled, it was warm, it wasn't freezing, and stuff like that. Some people make it, some don't. I could make it because I was controlled. Like I said, I was an athlete, I thought good, I felt good, my body was all right, and I never had any problem, I completed it. But they called that a language school and there was a lot more stuff going on, that people knew about it that time. Then at China Lake, down there where I was in the Mohave, that's when those rockets were going faster than your body could take it, thousand miles an hour, 1,500 miles an hour, and all of that, but I grew up there, I got out of the military. In '61, '62, I went to work up at Yellowstone. My brother was working there and he called me, but I came back because I had gotten married in '61 to Genevieve. Like I says, we had our children. Then in '63, I went to worked at the Española Hospital up until '69. When I got transferred to Albuquerque and I started working for Xenco Medical Health, another medical thing, and I worked until '74. When I went to work for American National [00:35:00] Insurance Company out of Galveston, Texas until 2002, when I retired. Everybody always asks me, ""What are you going to do after you retire?"" I says, ""I'm going to go work for the Albuquerque Dukes Baseball Club."" Baseball paid for my high school, for my college, for my military, and everything, and I'm going to go work for that. I did, I've been working with the Isotopes now since 2003, when we came into existence, and I'm still doing it. In fact, I'll go to work tonight. But in 1971, because of my baseball compadre, cousin of mine in Albuquerque, asked me to join the Knights of Columbus. One of the best things that ever happened to me. I joined the Knights of Columbus and a men's Catholic fraternal organization that works with your community, your state, people with charity, unity for eternity, and patriotism. I was lucky to been elected the local president, the district president, the state president. I went probably in the United States longer than all of my relatives, my ancestors, ever did in their lives. I went from Boston to Miami, to California, to Chicago, to Kansas City, to Denver, to Tucson, you name it. Everywhere I went with doing Catholic work. One of the highlights that I ever had of doing Catholic work was helping the handicap. In 1981, my second year of being the state president, I had the honor of having General Godfrey for Farmington and all the good presidents of the local councils in the whole state working with me and for me. We collected, just by handing out a little candy bar to people to help handicap citizens in New Mexico. One day drive we pledged $107,000 in New Mexico, we collected a 104 of that. Goal which was met then and hasn't been met. Because of the tremendous work of all the people who worked for me, I was honored by the National Club of the Knights of Columbus, I've been a member of the circle of honor. I would like to thank at this time all the teachers that I ever had, from the first grade when I had Mrs. Sanwal who taught me, to the second grade; Mrs. Wetmore,, and the third grade; Mrs. Ferguson, in the fourth grade; Aimee Nelson, in the fifth and sixth grade, Lorraine Christensen. All other coaches that I ever had: Harold Mullins, Jackson Jukes. Incidentally, Jackson Jukes, my high school coach, passed away on the same day as my mother did in Price, Utah. All the coaches that I ever had. All the priests that I ever had: Father Connell Lynch from Gallup, Father [inaudible 00:38:48] from Roswell, Father Trudeau from New York City and here in Albuquerque, Father Walter Cassidy, my first two prison helper that I ever had, Father Lamothe and Father Dowling. The bishops that I've fell, Father Sanchez, Archbishop Sanchez, Bishop Tafoya, [inaudible 00:39:10] Davis, Michael Sheehan, Ricardo Ramirez from Las Cruces. Special thanks to my interviewer today, Diane, a nuclear technologist in her own right, which reminds me that we started this talk, talking about me and plowing horses in the field when I was a little kid. I wind up today with Diane, a nuclear scientist who was teaching me about that job. We went from plow horses to atomic energy, and here we are today. Thank you very much.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
MBY006530,"Lucille Montoya:	[00:00:00] My name is Lucille Jiron Montoya. I am 84. I was born in 1925, a good year. Today is May the 21st, 2010, and I'm in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I'm going to be talking to my son Jacobo Montoya. I had written this on Father's Day to my four sons and my two daughters. How fortunate. And I wanted to let you know how fortunate you were to have known your father. I want to tell you a little bit about his family since he is no longer here to tell you himself.Jacob Montoya:	Well, excuse me, Lucille. My name is Jacob. I am Lucille's son, and my age is 52, and today's date is May 21. I'm in Albuquerque. Of course, I'm with my mother and I'm a mama's boy all the way. I'm really interested in your story, Lucille. I think that you have a very good story to tell, and I think that everybody wants to hear this and I'm so happy that we are able to do this today. Let's hear what you have to say about our ancestors or what do we call these? Our relatives.Lucille Montoya:	Your father. You knew your father so you were fortunate.Jacob Montoya:	Yes, my dad was a wonderful man.Lucille Montoya:	That he came from a wonderful family.Jacob Montoya:	My dad was a one of a kind father. I'm just so happy with him. He was very special and he was unique. They don't make men like that anymore. He was a man among men. I would love for you to tell me the story about him because I'm very interested.Lucille Montoya:	Well, I'm going to tell you just actually a little bit of history. He came from a wonderful family which helped him to mold him into the man he became. His father was Juan Gonzales Montoya, born in 1863 and his mother was Domitilia Griego Fajardo. She was so proud of the Fajardo name. She was born in 1873. They were married in 1889. Your grandmother was only 16 years old and your grandfather was 26. It was really an arranged marriage, something that was common at that time. Juan was born May 1863 to Juan Baptiste Montoya and Maria Francisca Gonzales. Maria's father was Juan Cristobal Gonzales, who was born in Corrales, New Mexico. It was just actually --Jacob Montoya:	Corrales?Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, where Francine lives, a very small community. Now it's a little bit more exclusive because we have people from the east and everywhere that likes it because it's very nice. In 1816, he was baptized at San Felipe de Neri Church in Old Town. Actually renegade Indians who were led by Chief Victorio killed him in 1861 in Torreon, New Mexico.Jacob Montoya:	Torreon, that's over there by Cuba, correct? Torreon.Lucille Montoya:	No, it's actually down by --Jacob Montoya:	Torreon? Torreon is by --Lucille Montoya:	No, no, no. Torreon is part of Socorro County and it's up by Mountainair around there.Jacob Montoya:	I see.Lucille Montoya:	It's now just -- I think they have something --Jacob Montoya:	They've changed the name, probably.Lucille Montoya:	No, no. It's still Torreon. They just have something about the history. His mother, Domitilia was born in October 31, 1873. She was one of two children born to Feliz Fajardo and  Teodora Griego. Since there were no sons, Domitilia was brought up to help outdoors with farming and ranching. Her sister helped their mother cooking, cleaning, and maintaining the household. Domitilia was an accomplished writer. Do you remember her?Jacob Montoya:	She was like -- She was like Annie Oakley or what of the day or what was that?Lucille Montoya:	Yes, I think so.Jacob Montoya:	Was she really?Lucille Montoya:	She really was.Jacob Montoya:	I heard she could shoot guns and shoot all kind of things. And that was the days when they had to do all that hard work, wasn't it?Lucille Montoya:	She was known for her skill with horses. She could break a horse better than most men. She once confided in me that the reason her father decided to arrange her marriage was because somebody from Texas had asked for her hand in marriage. Evidently, that's when her father decided it was time for her to marry. He wanted to find a good man among the community from a good family. Since Domitilia had never worked indoors and hadn't learned to maintain the house, they decided the young couple would stay in her family's house till she learned how to cook, clean, and maintain a house.Jacob Montoya:	She learned how to ride before she could cook back [00:05:00] then, huh?Lucille Montoya:	Definitely. But she knew how to tell other people how to cook and everything else. Juan and Domitilia built their home in San Pedro, New Mexico, which is close to San Antonio, which has a lot of history behind it. They worked very hard farming and ranching. Your grandmother was not a lazy woman. She not only took care of the house, but still was very active outdoors. She would help her husband break horses, plow fields, butcher the animals, then go indoors and cook, clean, and take care of the house. I remember her telling me that if she did not like the position of a window or a door, she would move it. Of course, it was a little easier because it was an adobe house. She thought nothing of tearing down walls and putting them back to suit what she wanted.Lucille Montoya:	Another story was that one day while her husband was out farming, she decided she wanted to kill a beef. All alone she took one of the best cows and butchered it. When her husband came home and asked, ""Why did you butcher the best cow?"" She replied, ""Why not? She deserved it."" That's the kind of woman she was. In the 1900 century in San Pedro, New Mexico, your grandparents, Juan, 37, and Domitilia, 27, were registered at Farmers. It said they were married 12 years with four children, only one living, a son Pedro. You remember Uncle Pete?Jacob Montoya:	Uncle Pete, yeah.Lucille Montoya:	Who was five. Your grandmother had several children, but only two survived to see adulthood. They were Margarita, the mother of your aunt Emelia, and Vivian Montoya. Margarita married a miner named Pedro Padilla. She died at an early age soon after giving birth to her daughter Emelia Padilla. Your grandmother Domitilia, 44, had given birth to a son three months before that. That was your dad, Vivian. Pedro was unable to completely care for Emelia, so grandma Domitilia raised her along with your father. That's how they were raised, as brother and sister and why they were so close all their lives. Since she was nursing your dad at that time, she also nursed Emelia and supplemented their food with goat milk from the family goat. Emelia's father came to visit often until his death. When Emelia was around three, he was killed in a coal mining accident by San Pedro.Jacob Montoya:	Aunty's father was killed?Lucille Montoya:	Yeah.Jacob Montoya:	But dad and her were like brothers, even though they weren't.Lucille Montoya:	They were three months separate actually, that was his niece.Jacob Montoya:	That's why they were so close.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. Your dad, Vivian Victor Montoya, was born May 7, 1917 in San Pedro. He was named after his godfather Vivian Victor Tafoya, who was sheriff in Socorro County. Tradition was that the godparents named the child, not the parents. Sometimes the parents didn't know what their child's name would be until after their godparents chose the name. When your father was still a very young man, the family moved to San Antonio, which was just across the river. I still have a picture of their old house.Jacob Montoya:	San Antonio, New Mexico.Lucille Montoya:	New Mexico. While in San Antonio, the family went into business with Conrad Hilton's parents.Jacob Montoya:	I remember dad said he did know Conrad.Lucille Montoya:	Oh, yeah. He even went to visit.Jacob Montoya:	He was very proud of that fact.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. The Hiltons immigrated from Europe, maybe Scotland. They met your grandparents and decided to go into business together raising sheep. The Hiltons also ran a bed and breakfast there in San Antonio, New Mexico. Actually, Conrad Hilton didn't start his hotel business. His first hotel was in Texas. But your grandmother, Domitilia, remembered Conrad Hilton as a young boy. He would help get the wool ready to send to sell in Albuquerque. She also said he was fluent in Spanish. Of course, he would be because he was Hispanic.Jacob Montoya:	Well, I wish they would have stayed in business. We would have been rich. We would have been with Conrad, of course, he's a billionaire.Lucille Montoya:	Well, no. His parents died, and Conrad Hilton went on to hotels in California and Texas and I don't know how many. Conrad Hilton's parents never learned Spanish. So when hearing Conrad speak in Spanish, they weren't aware that some of his Spanish was improper in any language.Jacob Montoya:	He wasn't very good in Spanish?Lucille Montoya:	No, he was fluent in Spanish.Jacob Montoya:	He was.Lucille Montoya:	But he -- you know, cuss words in Spanish.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, we all know those.Lucille Montoya:	His dad wasn't aware that some of the Spanish was improper [00:10:00] in any language. Your dad was very happy in San Antonio and had very fond memories. He had a horse named Blacky that he would ride. All the planes there that when we go on the freeway, you'll see there's nothing there and he rode all there. He learned to swim at an early age. He told me that the way he learned to swim was that someone threw him into the river, and it was learn or drown. So he tried to teach me how to swim and I was always afraid. He also recounted many memories of his childhood. He said that every Saturday his mom would bathe the children and clip their nails. This would keep their hearts clean, and clipping their nails would keep them from the temptation of taking things that didn't belong to them.Jacob Montoya:	Dad would never steal anything. He must have --Lucille Montoya:	Not even a pencil.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah. His nails must have been --Lucille Montoya:	This is why your father felt so strongly about being clean and honest. He also remembered every June 24 during fiesta time, during the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, they would bathe in the ditches or river. They believed that on that day, all the waters were blessed, so he kept doing that.Jacob Montoya:	A lot of the traditions, a lot of them.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. Isleta Indians also have that tradition. In 1924, your father's father, Juan, passed away at the age of 61. It was then after losing her husband and all her children, other than your father and Aunt Emelia, that she decided to move to Socorro, New Mexico. She sold everything she owed so that she could move into a town that had a doctor. Your father was about 10 years old and he had several bouts of pneumonia. She moved to Socorro with your dad, your Aunt Emelia, and I think Uncle Pete. Now, she rented a room from a man who was also widowed with one son and three daughters, his name was Felipe Domingo Montoya. No relation to her husband, Juan Montoya was dead. You knew him as Papa Mingo. Do you remember Papa Mingo?Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, Papa. I remember that name, yeah.Lucille Montoya:	He was a carpenter by trade and was in charge of the crabtree lumber there, a hard-working man. It was during the depression and very hard to make a living. Domingo's son, Uncle Andy, went to live with Domingo's brother. As payment, he would charge everything he needed from the lumber yard. This really put Domingo in debt. After your grandmother moved into Domingo's, they decided to marry. It was good for both of them. Papa Mingo had someone to help raise his children and it gave Domitilia a large family that she could care and nurture. She helped get her husband, Domingo, out of debt with the money she had brought from her first marriage to Juan Montoya. She took her husband's son, Andy, back from the brother and brought him home.Lucille Montoya:	Since Papa Mingo didn't have the time or experience to take care of the three daughters, Carlota, Kate, and Isabella, she took care of them. She brought the family altogether, fed them, clothed them, and taught them right from wrong. She treated them all the same just as you have done with your dad, Emelia, and Uncle Pete. She was a woman who loved to help those in need, and anytime someone needed help, she was there. Your grandmother had a cousin who's husband died and left her with a son about two years old. Her cousin met and married a man who worked at a carnival circuit, so they went to all the fiestas. They went from town to town, earning a living. Since she wasn't able to take care of Pete, your grandmother took him in. He was two years old when he went to live. He was raised as Pete Montoya, even though his legal name was Pete Baca.Lucille Montoya:	While in Socorro, the state asked if she would take in children, and she took in through from the welfare department Angela. Do you remember Angela? She was really part of the family. She lived there until she got married and started her own family. She even took three young men who had escaped from Springer Detention Center in Springer, New Mexico. One was from Mogollon, New Mexico and it was coincidence. You know that we lived in Mogollon, which had been a mining town second time around. The lady that lived in our house, lived upstairs, and that was his sister. So that was interesting. One was from Texas and one from Puerto Rico, [00:15:00] and he actually was called Puerto Rico. Eventually, he went to New York and I guess maybe went back home. He was very protective and watched over them like a mother hen.Lucille Montoya:	I also wanted to mention that I happen to have some of Hilton's mother's furniture because she sold your grandmother the house with some furniture. So, if you noticed, I have about three pieces. At one point, she had me write to Conrad Hilton because she needed some help with her Social Security because she wasn't getting it. Very kindly, he had us go to his lawyer in Albuquerque on a conference. I was a Tupperware manager. You remember my number Tupperware days?Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, I remember.Lucille Montoya:	We went to a conference at the Beverly Hills Hilton and your dad asked about Conrad and they said, ""Well, they directed him to his corporate office"", which was across the track from the hotel we stayed in. When he asked for Hilton, they said, ""Well, you need an appointment. He's very busy."" So he said, ""We'll give you his name."" So he was ushered into Hilton, and Hilton wanted to talk to him all in Spanish. So, it was a little reunion. Also, you know what they had? I have a copy of it. ""This Is Your Life,"" one of the movies. They used to have those all the time.Jacob Montoya:	On TV, yeah. ""This is Your Life.""Lucille Montoya:	They actually had people from San Antonio. They were flown to L.A.Jacob Montoya:	For that program? Yeah, ""This is Your Life.""Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. Also, there were a lot of interesting other things, for instance, San Antonio, the Owl Cafe, which nobody knows about was famous, also San Marcial was the city that is no longer there. The river went backwards.Jacob Montoya:	Right. It washed it up, and it's not there.Lucille Montoya:	I have a picture of it, by the way. Also, his school teachers were Sisters of Loretto, and turned out, that they were also Montoya and McIntyre. So I have a lot of pictures of those. So, that's just a little bit of your -- Of course, you were fortunate to know your dad and your grandmother. Oh, no! You were two years old.Jacob Montoya:	When she died?Lucille Montoya:	No.Jacob Montoya:	I was older than that. I think I was like six.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. That's when we moved up to the country and decided we were going to be little pioneers because the freeway took --What did they do? They condemned our houses to put the big freeway.Jacob Montoya:	The big I-25? The big I.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. So, what do you think about -- Well, anyway, I wanted you to know -- Well, you knew your dad.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, that's dad's, but your history is very important.Lucille Montoya:	I have a lot of history of when they came into New Mexico.Jacob Montoya:	Right.Lucille Montoya:	Well, a part of our family came into the 1600s.Jacob Montoya:	1600s. You did all the genealogy?Lucille Montoya:	I have a little bit of it, yes.Jacob Montoya:	You are showing that we came from Spain, right?Lucille Montoya:	Well, you know what? We don't call ourselves Spanish because our ancestors came from Spain, and possibly, I know they were baptized in Valladolid, Spain, but only two brothers came to Mexico City. There, they married. But that's the part of my family though. I have a lot on your dad's family. You know what she told me one time which was so sad?Jacob Montoya:	Who is this?Lucille Montoya:	She was telling me about her father.Jacob Montoya:	Who was telling you?Lucille Montoya:	Domitilia. I'm going back to Domitilia.Jacob Montoya:	Okay.Lucille Montoya:	She was telling me that she had -- I asked her about pictures because I love pictures, and she said, she made a bonfire because she was afraid her grandchildren would laugh at her father, because he went to the river, washed his hair, and it went down to his knees, and she burned them all. What a pity. I love pictures, but I do have pictures of her when she was older. I have pictures of your dad, when he was -- he and Emelia --Jacob Montoya:	Were little?Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, and he was dressed with that.Jacob Montoya:	He had him dressed all?Lucille Montoya:	Yeah.Jacob Montoya:	Girl?Jacob Montoya:	Yeah.Lucille Montoya:	So I love pictures and I have a lot of them.Jacob Montoya:	You have a big scrapbook, and those pictures are just truly amazing of all the pictures you have in it.Lucille Montoya:	Of course, that's just one part of your side of your family. Now, one of these days I'm going to write about them, De Jiron, Pacheco, my gosh, [inaudible 00:19:55] , Chavez.Jacob Montoya:	We have lot of Chavez, don't we?Lucille Montoya:	I'm Chavez on my -- My dad's mother was Chavez. [00:20:00] My mother's father was Chavez, and as far as I know, they weren't related. But they -- It was all a very -- They were Hispanics that --Jacob Montoya:	But you're a Jiron? You're a Jiron.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, Jiron. And you know it's spelled with a j --.Jacob Montoya:	They changed it at one time.Lucille Montoya:	-- a g, and an x. When I went to Spain, I happened to meet some family, not Valladolid but in San Santiago de Compostela, and I got to meet them, and they were going to give me the history, and I was supposed to get it on the computer, but some way or other, it didn't come through. So I'd love to go back, but I am too old for that. I'm 84, son.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, my goodness. That's not bad.Lucille Montoya:	Okay. Is there anything you wanted to ask me?Jacob Montoya:	I think there's a lot interesting about dad, how dad back in them days, it was really different back then.Lucille Montoya:	Oh, and let me tell you.Jacob Montoya:	There were the wagons, and then I just remember dad and his little old cars, and seeing those old pictures, it's just amazing.Lucille Montoya:	Can I tell you something, for one reason or other, when he graduated from the eighth grade, they had a chair, but the teacher spoke Spanish. They had a chair, just because he was sick, he was dying. That time, you know what saved him? The doctor there in Socorro said, ""There is something new that's available."" What did they give for pneumonia? I forgot. Oh my god, my gosh, what did they give now? They had just discovered penicillin.Jacob Montoya:	Penicillin.Lucille Montoya:	They saved him, and then he tried going back to school, but he was so charismatic.Jacob Montoya:	He couldn't -- Yeah, dad was just very charismatic. But what was amazing that all through all the wars, he never went to over --Lucille Montoya:	Well, no, because he had a bad accident as a child.Jacob Montoya:	As a child.Lucille Montoya:	His back.Jacob Montoya:	So that's why they wouldn't enlist him during all the wars.Lucille Montoya:	But let me tell you, he did a lot of things after that. He went to work at an airport, military airport.Jacob Montoya:	Right. He had a lot of different jobs.Lucille Montoya:	Then he started working for Sandia Labs.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah. He was a motorcycle cop at one time.Lucille Montoya:	He got his own motorcycle.Jacob Montoya:	He used to sell Maytag remember, was it appliances?Lucille Montoya:	Appliances.Jacob Montoya:	Not Maytag. What was it?Lucille Montoya:	No, it was for [inaudible 00:22:42] company. He had a big truck, and he went all over the --Jacob Montoya:	He went all over the place. Yeah.Lucille Montoya:	He went to the Indian reservations, sold, had in the truck Maytags, and pianos, and organs.Jacob Montoya:	I remember I found one of his business cards about -- and Madonna was like about --Lucille Montoya:	Oh, in the mountains.Jacob Montoya:	In the mountains. I was going through junk drawers, and I've seen this business card, and it had his name on there, and I was just blown away by seeing that card. Remember that, and I gave it to him?Lucille Montoya:	Then he retired from Sandia Labs as a security inspector.FEMALE_1:	How did you meet your husband?Lucille Montoya:	That's very interesting. Do you want me to tell you how I met my husband?Jacob Montoya:	Yeah. How did you -- Well, you met him --Lucille Montoya:	The reason I met him is, we lived in this mining town.Jacob Montoya:	They set you up.Lucille Montoya:	No. I graduated from the eighth grade, and there was no way you could go to high school. So my parents sent me from Mogollon, Catron County to Socorro, and I stayed with my grandmother, and I went to school. While going to school, I was a ninth grader, I had a cousin, Feliz, which you know, and she took me to a dance where you all stood around, and he said, ""You know, I saw somebody that was just, well.""Jacob Montoya:	You were a knockout, mom.Lucille Montoya:	I was young and beautiful, and she said, ""Well, what is she wearing?"" I had bought from Spiegel, a beautiful velveteen dress with yellow lace inserts, and he described me and she laughed, and when I came back to the group standing, we were introduced, and then we went riding in his car with Feliz and her husband -- I mean, her boyfriend Ciriaco. Then he went to California because of the war. They were bugging -- They wanted him -- The mother kept saying, ""Why is only my son going to war?""Jacob Montoya:	They were upset.Lucille Montoya:	So he went to work, and from there, he sent me a card that Yolanda still has no me olvides. Then he came back [00:25:00] and went to work. I was going to school in Silver City, New Mexico, another mining town. My dad was a miner; he had passed away.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, but didn't he say that ""I'm going to marry that woman,"" or something? What was that about?Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, and then we stopped with my uncle one time and he was working at a service station with Ciriaco, and he kept looking, and I had gone across, just a young kid, I was eighth grader, ninth grader to get a hamburger, and then he was there. So he said to Ciriaco, ""You should see what's sitting back there."" And Ciriaco went and looked and said, ""What's the matter with you? She's a kid."" He said, ""Oh, well, she'll grow someday.""Lucille Montoya:	We married in 1945, just as I graduated,  because my dad --Jacob Montoya:	But he was like 10 years older than you, right? Lucille Montoya:	About nine. Yeah.Jacob Montoya:	About nine.Lucille Montoya:	But he had been waiting for me, and I decided I better take him because he was a wonderful man.Jacob Montoya:	Dad was good.Lucille Montoya:	He never disappointed me. We celebrated our 50th anniversary and just about that time, we found out he did have cancer in the bile duct or something.Jacob Montoya:	I wonder how he got that.Lucille Montoya:	Well, you know what? He had taken a lot of medications for his pneumonia. He never drank because let me tell you what he also did in between in Socorro.Jacob Montoya:	He was a bartender at one time.Lucille Montoya:	Well, actually he took care of a bar while the guy went to Italy. He was left completely in charge. So he could not put up with anybody that was a little tipsy or big tipsy, I should say.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, he didn't like that?Lucille Montoya:	No, he didn't drink, which was fortunate because none of you do.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah.Lucille Montoya:	So, he left four wonderful sons, and two wonderful daughters, and just recently his namesake Vivian MichaelJacob Montoya:	Junior, yeah.Lucille Montoya:	Died in a sudden accident. So we have our good times and our bad times. But New Mexico was very New Mexican. People from Mexico would come and say, ""That's not the way you say words.""Jacob Montoya:	We had our own different dialect. I never really say that we're Mexican. I always figured we're Spanish but we're not. We're New Mexican.Lucille Montoya:	New Mexicans, because let me tell you --Jacob Montoya:	Our ancestors have been here so long that it's just --Lucille Montoya:	They married into -- You know what? They had a good relationship with the Indians, especially the Isleta. Now, of course, at one point, they were chased back and killed and they had to leave.Jacob Montoya:	We went back and forth, the revolt and all that kind of stuff.Lucille Montoya:	Then they came back.Jacob Montoya:	But we came back.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. We came back.Jacob Montoya:	We had run off, and we came back.Lucille Montoya:	Well, just just one word in Spanish, which they were always trying to correct me. I would say, ""tunico,"" which is, ""Oh, no, it's vestido,"" and I said, ""Well, tunic sounds better to me."" Then I'd say like, gosh, a lot of other words they would criticize that we didn't know how to speak Spanish. But you know what? We spoke ancient Spanish.Jacob Montoya:	Ancient Spanish.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. That was New Mexico.Jacob Montoya:	I just remember all dad's stories. I used to love to listen to his stories about say, Elfego Baca, because he was such a famous person. Dad knew him personally and I thought that was really interesting about all the people that dad knew and all the jobs that dad had in his earlier days.Lucille Montoya:	The Elfego Baca is another story. Let me tell you, it's connected to both families.Jacob Montoya:	Elfego is?Lucille Montoya:	Because Elfego Baca was actually, the family were from Socorro, which would be my mother's family. But then when he did his -- At 19, after he had gone to St. Louis.Jacob Montoya:	Elfego was quite a story. Yes.Lucille Montoya:	It's a big story.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, yeah. I know. I just thought it was so neat.Lucille Montoya:	He went into the small little, where my Jiron is.Jacob Montoya:	The little town, he went over there and that's where he got his name, right? In reserve in Catron County?Lucille Montoya:	Yes. Because the Texans would come in and shoot them, thinking they were funny, stealing maybe a cow and shoot up the chickens.Jacob Montoya:	He was kind like a Robin Hood of the Mexicans in New Mexico. There was quite a story of Elfego Baca.Lucille Montoya:	That's a big story. That's another story.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, he's another story.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, and I was thinking -- I think I did mention the fact that San Marcial and Tokay, there was a mining town and that's where Aunt Emelia's father died.Jacob Montoya:	But your family was with the mining, Dad's wasn't.Lucille Montoya:	[00:30:00] No.Jacob Montoya:	Your side of the family.Lucille Montoya:	Thank you, son.Jacob Montoya:	Thank you, mother. Very interesting. I just love all your stories, and I love all the details, and I love all the -- our history.Lucille Montoya:	Pictures.Jacob Montoya:	Thank you.Lucille Montoya:	Okay.Jacob Montoya:	Have we run out of time?FEMALE_1:	Well, no. You have 10 minutes left. I meant that because you were 10 minutes.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, 10 minutes.FEMALE_1:	Do you have anything else you wanted to talk about? We're still recording. So, do you have any questions or anything?Jacob Montoya:	Well, no. I think that -- We're pretty much on dad's side of the story. We haven't said anything about your side of the story.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah. Well, no. The reason we live in the South Valley now is because of the freeway.Jacob Montoya:	Are we still talking?FEMALE_1:	Yeah, we're still recording.Lucille Montoya:	Guess why we always ended down there? Because your dad wanted a horse.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, the South Valley, Los PadillasLucille Montoya:	Los Padillas.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, I know. When we moved down there, there was not very many people, I mean Los Padillas.Lucille Montoya:	No, you know Los Padillas was started in 1705 before Albuquerque. No. But we got a house with acreage. He went down to La Joya, which is south. No, south?Jacob Montoya:	Of Polvadera? Yeah.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, all those old communities. He went down there and had a friend that had a wild, wild mare. Well, it was running. By the time he brought her home, she had a little colt. Don't you remember that horse?Jacob Montoya:	Whiskey and Baby Doll.Lucille Montoya:	Whiskey and Baby Doll. Because the mare was like golden. Oh, and you kids rode that horse. We even had a cow because he had a raffle. Would you believe from reserve, my family, he won the raffle of a cow.Jacob Montoya:	Dad won the raffle?Jacob Montoya:	Yeah. I learned how to make butter, churn butter.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah, back in them days, we used to milk the cow and we had chickens. It was like we went back to the old days. We lived like that, didn't we? We had an outhouse and I remember it was really different back then.Lucille Montoya:	We rented our house in town and moved just to camp out. It turned out it was two years of camping out, which was not too easy.Jacob Montoya:	That was amazing how you built all the houses with no mortgage.Lucille Montoya:	Yeah, we built a house actually.Jacob Montoya:	How many houses did you guys build?Lucille Montoya:	The first house we built was in Albuquerque, the one they condemned. We did it with no mortgage. Two hundred dollars a month your Dad was earning as a salesmen, but thank God to your grandmother and Papa Mingo. They came, he brought his brother and we paid them like pennies too and I would help. Then when they condemned it, we came to the South Valley and we made that two story house on five acres. Then all of a sudden, I wanted to be near my aunt. So then I decided to get rid of that. Oh, I miss my house on the Black Mesa.Jacob Montoya:	That was beautiful.Lucille Montoya:	Then we made a house but next to Aunt Olympia. Now, that's another story about Aunt Olympia.Jacob Montoya:	She was amazing lady.Lucille Montoya:	That was my dad's half-sister.Jacob Montoya:	Right. She lived to be what, 90?Lucille Montoya:	Ninety seven.Jacob Montoya:	Ninety seven.Lucille Montoya:	Right now, I have one, my dad's aunt, which would be my great aunt, she's 100 and a half. My mother's first cousin, the oldest one she had, she was about 101 too.Jacob Montoya:	So you have two 100.Lucille Montoya:	I don't think I'm going to make it.Jacob Montoya:	You still have two alive and you're the next in line at 84.Lucille Montoya:	No. I still have Feliz, is 94.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, Feliz is 94. She's 10 years.Lucille Montoya:	That's my mother's niece.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, the one that set you up with dad.Lucille Montoya:	Yes.Jacob Montoya:	Yeah. Wow, amazing.Lucille Montoya:	Actually, we were sponsors to their marriage. So it was a very close-knit Hispanic community. We didn't have like, oh my grandpa on my dad's side, that's another great story. They were all over New Mexico.Jacob Montoya:	And one of our -- who got killed by Geronimo, who was one of our?Lucille Montoya:	That was on my mother's side. Her dad was Miguel Pacheco. Jacob Montoya:	He got killed by Geronimo, you said.Lucille Montoya:	Yes. They were in a mine, near going up to a mining town. But where we finally ended up by leaving, my grandfather lived --That's another big story because my grandfather worked in this mining town.Jacob Montoya:	I didn't really think that all those mining stories were interesting. Now, I love all your pictures with the miners and the Mogollon and I think that [00:35:00] is just so interesting.Lucille Montoya:	Guess what? Then we went to live the second time in Mogollon, so that was interesting. That's other stories.Jacob Montoya:	Oh, you have hundreds of stories, I think, but the one we're talking about today was dad, and I think it was just very interesting. I just miss my dad so much.Lucille Montoya:	I talked too much. Did you finish? Thank you.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
MBY006536,"Natalie Romero:	[00:00:00] Hi. My name is Natalie Romero and my age is 24. Today's date is May 22nd, 2010 and I live in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm here with my grandmother.Nancy Gonzalez:	My name is Nancy Gonzalez. I am 67 years old. Today's May the 22nd, 2010, I live in Albuquerque, and I'm here with my granddaughter, Natalie.Natalie Romero:	Where did you grow up, grandmother?Nancy Gonzalez:	I grew up in San Jose, San Miguel County.Natalie Romero:	How many children do you have?Nancy Gonzalez:	Two.Natalie Romero:	Girls?Nancy Gonzalez:	Two girls.Natalie Romero:	How many grandchildren do you have?Nancy Gonzalez:	Three. Two boys and a girl.Natalie Romero:	How many generations have we been here?Nancy Gonzalez:	Seven.Natalie Romero:	Seven generations. What was the happiest time that you could remember from your childhood?Nancy Gonzalez:	My happiest, when we lived in my home town that we run wild all over. We got no shoes, and we go to the river, we do all kinds of things like that.Natalie Romero:	How many brothers and sisters do you have?Nancy Gonzalez:	There was seven in our family. Five sisters and three brothers, eight.Natalie Romero:	Eight. My mother, how was she like when she was young?Nancy Gonzalez:	She was very hardheaded. She's hard to get along.Natalie Romero:	My auntie, she was?Nancy Gonzalez:	Very easy going. She always obey me, which is real good and I never had to fight with her.Natalie Romero:	My grandfather, I never got to meet him.Nancy Gonzalez:	Your grandfather was just like your Aunt Lucille, very quiet and shy.Natalie Romero:	Very calm. I never got to meet my grandmother either. How was my grandmother? Your mother?Nancy Gonzalez:	My mother was very quiet, very easy going. She would have loved you guys, she would have known you.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, if we would have got the chance to meet her.Nancy Gonzalez:	Garcia was everybody's favorite because she was so quiet, and good, and everything.Natalie Romero:	You don't remember any stories that they used to tell you when you were little?Nancy Gonzalez:	Like what? What kind of stories do you want to hear?Natalie Romero:	Just any kind of stories like about things that would happen or things that happened.Nancy Gonzalez:	Well, in a little town like then not too much happening. It was mostly religion things that happen around there. I made my first holy communion in Spanish.Natalie Romero:	In Spanish?Nancy Gonzalez:	We had to go everyday, but I never really learned it in Spanish. We moved to Colorado and I went to catechism where I learned it in English. We came back when I was nine years old. So I've lived here in Albuquerque since I was nine years old.Natalie Romero:	Nine years old.Nancy Gonzalez:	I used to be the family's babysitter at the age of nine. I used to take care of all seven kids. Well, six kids.Natalie Romero:	You're the oldest or the youngest?Nancy Gonzalez:	No, I'm number three.Natalie Romero:	Number three. What kind of work have you always done?Nancy Gonzalez:	Well, I've done a lot of different kinds of jobs. I worked at Bueno Foods as a wrapper, and I worked at Sunbelt. I worked there 18 years in production control and inventory clerk. When it closed down, I went to hospice. I worked with a caregiver. I worked with Kabana and other jewelry place. Then I retired and started doing voluntary work at Holy Family Church and now I'm Viola's assistant, and the church pays me when I work there. I worked with the St. Vincent de Paul, and I worked with a mobile food bank and I do home visits for the St. Vincent de Paul, and this is where all my time goes.Natalie Romero:	So you work a lot?Nancy Gonzalez:	I still have time to go visit you guys. I spend time with you guys and everything.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, and to see my kids grow. What was the most important person in your life or who has been the most important? Who's changed your life? Who have you looked up to?Nancy Gonzalez:	Who I looked up to? My two daughters are the most important things. I have worked for them, and what I have is theirs. I don't want anybody to mistreat them, but I don't know what else to do to think or want. I want things to be good for your mother, especially. She works very hard.Natalie Romero:	I know.Nancy Gonzalez:	Look at Lucille, Lucille works really good. She has an easy life. I wish your mother will have the same thing too. But she has a hard life. She works a lot and there isn't enough money around there and I wish things would be different.Natalie Romero:	So you think if we would move out of there, it would be better?Nancy Gonzalez:	No, I figure if you guys would work and help her. You guys don't have to move out. Work and help her. Try to make the house more comfortable and everything. [00:05:00] That's all I ask. Get rid of the dogs.Natalie Romero:	My poor dogs. Let's see.Nancy Gonzalez:	I wish, Natalie, that you will go back to school.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, I need to go to school.Nancy Gonzalez:	You have kids and you've going to have to support those kids. You need to finish school. Because without school, you're not going to do anything, you're not going to be able to get a good job to support your kids.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, I'm going to struggle.Nancy Gonzalez:	You are. See, I didn't have to struggle after your grandpa died at the age of 30. I was 29 years old and I had a good job with Sunbelt. So my kids never suffered. I had a good job. I was able to provide for them and everything.Natalie Romero:	I know.Nancy Gonzalez:	We have to take responsibility of our kids. Don't put the load on nobody. You have to look after your kids.Natalie Romero:	Do it myself.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes. If the fathers don't want to do it, don't bother them, you do it.Natalie Romero:	I know. I need to do better.Nancy Gonzalez:	Now that your car gets fixed, you better take responsibility of that car.Natalie Romero:	Fix it and keep it running.Nancy Gonzalez:	Exactly. Get insurance and that's the first thing you have to do. The car, I gave it to you, not for Joseph, for Frankie or anybody, it's for you. So you can take your kids where they need to go, doctor, school, or whatever. It's for their use, nobody else. Because when I bought that car, Natalie, I worked hard to pay for that car.Natalie Romero:	I know.Nancy Gonzalez:	It wasn't an easy thing. Nobody gave it to me. I had to work to pay for it.Natalie Romero:	I know. What was your childhood like growing up?Nancy Gonzalez:	My childhood was just a lot of responsibilities.Natalie Romero:	So you were never really a kid. You always had something you had to do?Nancy Gonzalez:	I was never a kid. I went to school, came home, did the ironing for the family. I went to work. I was the neighbor's babysitter. That's what I did. I didn't have a growing up childhood. I was doing something. The way I do now, you see me, I'm always working, doing all kinds of things.Natalie Romero:	That's all [inaudible 00:07:16] doing is, I had kids.Nancy Gonzalez:	I didn't know nothing about going to movies, nothing about anything. I think I had my first hamburger in 1959.Natalie Romero:	School, did you?Nancy Gonzalez:	I did good. I was in the honor roll when I was in ninth grade with all Bs. Then, like I said, I went to school after Lucille and Ruthie got married. I went to TDI to finish my school and I took the basics. I took typing because at Sunbelt I was required to know the keyboard for the computer that I used to work, travel cars from department to department and I passed typing with a B and I passed all my other classes were good. The only thing I didn't do was go for, when I finished school, I didn't go. I didn't want to see what I had until they sent me my grades. So that's what I want. If I did it when I was 40-some years old.Natalie Romero:	I can do it too.Nancy Gonzalez:	You can do it too. I went Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, three hours a day, each day.Natalie Romero:	Aunt Lucille and my mom both graduated because you pushed them to graduate?Nancy Gonzalez:	They were lucky. I bought them a car so they won't have to be riding the bus. They had an easy life, both of them.Natalie Romero:	How do you get along with your brothers and sisters?Nancy Gonzalez:	I don't know. A little good. Not so bad. It's my neighbor next door that gives me a hard time. He's got a bad attitude.Natalie Romero:	Yeah.Nancy Gonzalez:	Your Auntie Gerdie, the same thing.Natalie Romero:	Crazy, she is.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. But the rest, they're all right, you know.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. They all get along. Auntie Tina and other aunties.Nancy Gonzalez:	After all, Paul and Gerdie, are the ones I used to take care when they were little, and Tina.Natalie Romero:	Those are the youngest ones.Nancy Gonzalez:	Anna's pretty good. Because I remember I took care of them. When your auntie Anna was 18 years old, I got her a job at Sunbelt, where I was working. I signed for her to get a brand new car, a little Pinto. I had a hard time with her, but she paid it off, and she has always looked up to me, too.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, my auntie Anna. She's always been good, nice lady.Nancy Gonzalez:	Your uncle Paul, when he was going to get his retirement, he called me one morning, ""Where's my birth certificate?"" I said, ""I don't know."" He said, ""Well, what happened to it?"" I said, ""I don't know. You didn't live with me.""Natalie Romero:	Like you're the mom?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah.Natalie Romero:	You've always got along with all your nephews and nieces.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. Always. They call me Auntie Nanny. [00:10:00] We raised Georgio. When your grandpa was alive, he wanted a little boy so bad, and Georgio used to stay with us. Then when he died, my husband used to give me the papers for him. Because I was going to need somebody to take care of him, if he was going to stay with me. But she didn't want to, so she took him. But Georgio's almost like your mother's and Lucille's brother.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. He's always been around. He's a very nice guy too. Who do you get along with best in your family? Relative wise like with sister or brother?Nancy Gonzalez:	About the same.Natalie Romero:	All the same?Nancy Gonzalez:	Me and Anna go on vacation together every year.Natalie Romero:	Yeah.Nancy Gonzalez:	Me and Gertrude go to breakfast every Sunday.Natalie Romero:	Then you go to church every Saturday with Auntie Viola.Nancy Gonzalez:	I go see Tina all the time, and she's really happy to see me.Natalie Romero:	I haven't seen Auntie Tina for a long time.Nancy Gonzalez:	I even go see Joanne, and now that Martin died, I had to go over there. Because I really feel really hurt for them. I just feel like crying when I see him since Martin died. I know what they're going through because I went through the same thing.Natalie Romero:	Amanda is making her graduation.Nancy Gonzalez:	She graduated and we're all planning to go to her party. I got her a graduation card already, and I'll put money in there, and she'll be happy with that.Natalie Romero:	Yeah.Interviewer:	Can I ask you a quick question?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes.Interviewer:	Do you remember your first memories of Natalie?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. I used to take care of Natalie. I used to babysit for her, and I remember her grandma. When I had to work, her grandma would come and give me some money. Because I'm going on the bus, I need money to take Natalie. Natalie would spend time with me. But Natalie, when she got to be big, six or seven years old, she used to like to run the streets. At nine o'clock at night, these two live with me, I had to go look for her, and she'd be mad. I had her little brother, which was about six, seven months, and I had to go out in the dark and find her, and bring her, and put her to bed, and she'd be mad and telling me off.Natalie Romero:	I remember those days. Well, we always lived good with you.Nancy Gonzalez:	Then when you had your baby boy, he was so skinny. I'd buy you all kinds of baby food because I wanted him to get fat.Natalie Romero:	I had one that was chunky, and one that was skinny.Nancy Gonzalez:	I should feel sorry for him. I have tried, Natalie, to help you provide for your kids as much as I can.Natalie Romero:	I know. More than my mom has.Nancy Gonzalez:	When you need something, I tried to get it. I'll annoy everybody. You need this, you need that, I tried to get it.Natalie Romero:	I know. We do good, though. We don't argue when we're near you. We used to always fight, always fighting. Remember about my dad?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. But the things I told you about your dad are true. Even though [inaudible 00:13:05] , but he could have done better.Natalie Romero:	I know. He could have done a lot better.Nancy Gonzalez:	I didn't want him to stay home and just be on drugs. I wanted to him to get up and go to work, the way your mother did.Natalie Romero:	I know. He didn't even pick us up when he's supposed to.Nancy Gonzalez:	That would get me mad. Do you remember when we wanted to go somewhere, and you didn't want to go, because you're waiting for your dad? I used to tell you, ""Your dad's not going to come, Natalie.""Natalie Romero:	I used to wait for hours.Nancy Gonzalez:	Hours and hours. Then we didn't get to go, where we wanted to go.Natalie Romero:	I know. I just would be mad and you'd be mad because we'd be waiting and waiting.Nancy Gonzalez:	But we knew, that the way he was, we knew he wouldn't come. He had other things better than to come and take you out. Who got you your first bike?Natalie Romero:	You.Nancy Gonzalez:	You and Frankie got your first bike. Frankie, his first tennis shoes. Like that time, when you were going to dance at Rio Grande, and he was supposed to have gotten you some clothes. At the last minute, I ran to Kmart, and bought you a dress. Remember your dress?Natalie Romero:	Because he didn't buy me nothing.Nancy Gonzalez:	I got Frankie's little first pair of tennis shoes. This is what I always had to do. I had to look after you guys, because your dad didn't do it. Your mother was too busy working. She had to work to support you.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, I know. She worked hard. She's a good person.Nancy Gonzalez:	Remember like I said? I don't know what happened to her temper. Because if I was going through all that, I think everybody would have gotten it from me. Because I don't like all that shit that I see sometimes.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. You wouldn't have let them walk all over you.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah, I wouldn't.Natalie Romero:	I don't know how's she like that. Because she was mean when she was little. She used to beat up everybody, and want to fight with everybody, and everything. Now she's.Nancy Gonzalez:	Mellowed down?Natalie Romero:	Yeah.Nancy Gonzalez:	I don't know why.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. Now when she needs to be mean. [00:15:00] How long were you and grandpa married for?Nancy Gonzalez:	We were married about 13 years.Natalie Romero:	Where was he born? Here too?Nancy Gonzalez:	He was born in New Mexico, where I was born.Natalie Romero:	How many brothers and sisters did he have?Nancy Gonzalez:	He had two brothers and two sisters.Interviewer:	What was his name?Nancy Gonzalez:	His name was John Gonzales. My granddaughter John, was named after him.Natalie Romero:	Your grandson.Nancy Gonzalez:	My first grandson.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. What is the most important lesson you've learned in life?Nancy Gonzalez:	I'm supposing, most important thing I have learned of life, well, I haven't had no really big problems in life. The only problem is, I will say, was that I just had to work and work and work.Natalie Romero:	Work and work.Nancy Gonzalez:	That's all I've done, is work to advance, to have what I have. But I don't think I had it really a problem of anything. What's the most problems you have?Natalie Romero:	I've had a lot of problems. I had the kids young and didn't finish school, just trying to get everything together.Nancy Gonzalez:	The thing is you have to encourage them when they're small for them to finish school.Natalie Romero:	To go to school.Nancy Gonzalez:	You got to discipline them. If you say no, that means no.Natalie Romero:	Because that's how we were. We never had discipline.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. You guys didn't have discipline.Natalie Romero:	My mom and them always had discipline though.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. Because your great-grandmother used to tell me that I used to treat your mom and your Aunt Lucille like a stepmother. I told her, ""Look, mom. I'm trying to be a father and mother and support them. I have to be strict. I have to have rules. Those rules really help.""Natalie Romero:	Yeah. Because without rules then they just run wild.Nancy Gonzalez:	You know what I always tell you, this is my home. You are a guest in my home.Natalie Romero:	It's the truth. What was the happiest moment of your life that you could remember?Nancy Gonzalez:	I was so happy when Lucille was born. I didn't have any idea. Then I had another one. I wasn't even planning another one. All I wanted was one.Natalie Romero:	Then the other one came around?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah.Natalie Romero:	They are complete opposite, night and day.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes. I just can't believe it how they are. They were raised the same.Natalie Romero:	They lived together for so many years, everything the same, and they came out completely different.Nancy Gonzalez:	Complete different, yeah.Natalie Romero:	Like night and day.Nancy Gonzalez:	See, Lucille would never answer me back and Ruthie would.Natalie Romero:	She's still like that. She'll fight with whoever. You don't have no regrets in your life? Anything that you ever regretted doing or anything that you never regretted that you never did.Nancy Gonzalez:	Like I said, my childhood was very sad because I didn't have a chance to enjoy it. But if I had my life to live over, I would do it the same way because me and my sister, we had to quit school to support the family at seven or eight. We supported them from everything, from food, from everything, because my dad was sick. He couldn't work. Me and my older sister did it. Me and Viola did it. At that time we were 15 and 16 years old and we used to support the family. But if I had to do it again, I would do it because God has helped me, has provide for me very well.Natalie Romero:	Has made you who you are today?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes.Natalie Romero:	Grandpa, he died when he was young too, my great grandpa?Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. He died when he was about 54. That was not a very nice thing to talk about anyway. I don't like to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. That's it.Natalie Romero:	Where do you see yourself in the future? What do you want to do?Nancy Gonzalez:	What do I do?Natalie Romero:	What do you see yourself doing in the future? How can I say it?Nancy Gonzalez:	My future is already almost gone. It's yours the one we have to worry about.Natalie Romero:	Your future is not almost gone.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes, it is.Natalie Romero:	You still have a long way.Nancy Gonzalez:	We don't know. I'm 60-something years old. I have everything that I wanted in the future. It's you guys I worry about.Natalie Romero:	It's us that hold the future.Nancy Gonzalez:	You have to do something in your life. Number 1, school.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. Work.Nancy Gonzalez:	If I was able to do it when I was old, you can go to school too.Natalie Romero:	To work.Nancy Gonzalez:	To work.Natalie Romero:	[00:20:00] To have my own stuff.Nancy Gonzalez:	Because I used to work all day long and then go to school at six o'clock at night at TDI.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. My mom's doing it. So what do you want to see me do in my life? Just to succeed and go to school?Nancy Gonzalez:	Go to school.Natalie Romero:	What about to ever get married or just to stay single.Nancy Gonzalez:	Stay single because you already have kids from two different persons. You don't want to have a lot of kids. Unless you find a good man that is going to take care of you and take care of your kids and support you.Natalie Romero:	Provide and work together as a family, that's one of my main priorities.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes. You don't want to rush into anything. You rushed into all of these things already.Natalie Romero:	I know. I started off early.Nancy Gonzalez:	Now go slowly at it and see what you come up with.Natalie Romero:	My brother, what do you think my brother should do?Nancy Gonzalez:	Go back to school.Natalie Romero:	So both of us should just go back to school.Nancy Gonzalez:	Go back to school and work part-time. There's a lot of places you could work part-time. He's going to be 18 years old. Your mother cannot support him till he's viejo, you know? He's got to start working. I can see you guys not working if you're going to school. I never forced your mom or Lucille to go to work while they were going to school because I wanted them to do good.Natalie Romero:	To worry about school.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yes. But once they finished school, then they went to work and that's the way it's got to be. But if you don't go to school, you don't do nothing, you don't work, you got to do something.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. Or else you are just going to stay home and do nothing and be nothing.Nancy Gonzalez:	You're going to be nothing.Natalie Romero:	Were you happy when my mom first had me with my dad? Or you didn't like my dad?Nancy Gonzalez:	No. You were very cute. You were real fat, real cute.Natalie Romero:	Like Bree.Nancy Gonzalez:	Well, you know why I didn't like your dad, Natalie? Because he didn't like to work. He didn't like to provide for you guys.Natalie Romero:	Was he always like that?Nancy Gonzalez:	He was always like that.Natalie Romero:	From the beginning?Nancy Gonzalez:	In the beginning, your dad never had a job.Natalie Romero:	I don't know why did she go with him for then.Nancy Gonzalez:	I don't understand either.Natalie Romero:	Uncle Nab, he's always been good with Auntie Cill?Nancy Gonzalez:	No.Natalie Romero:	He always worked though.Nancy Gonzalez:	Uncle Nabi was a good son-in-law, a good father, a good uncle, but a lousy husband. That's what made him like that. But he was a good provider though.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, he was. I always remember.Nancy Gonzalez:	But, of course, she always had a good job.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. She wasn't dumb. She always made her money and did what she needed to do. That's the person that I looked up to. I look up to my mom because I love my mom, but to be more like my auntie.Nancy Gonzalez:	When you find a man, try to find a man that doesn't use drugs, that doesn't drink. They can drink, sociable, but drugs, that's a no.Natalie Romero:	But I don't even want one that drinks either.Nancy Gonzalez:	Because drugs is really bad. A man cannot be good if he's on drugs. He's not going to be good.Natalie Romero:	That's what happened with my dad. Dealing with my dad and all the stuff that we had to see.Nancy Gonzalez:	You got to see how your dad was.Natalie Romero:	Yeah Then having to see him sick was even worse. That was awful.Nancy Gonzalez:	I think the only time he walked a straight-line when actually he saw me at the door, that he knows I was going to get mad at him.Natalie Romero:	He was crazy.Nancy Gonzalez:	I should tell your mother, ""This better not disappear."" Anything I gave your mother, it never disappear.Natalie Romero:	But all her stuff did.Nancy Gonzalez:	Everything else did.Natalie Romero:	What else? Let's see. My mom, she's never been married either. I can't believe it.Nancy Gonzalez:	The thing is, anytime, Natalie, you're going to do anything, you got to follow up. You just can't start something and quit right there. You got to follow up til the end.Natalie Romero:	That's what you always tell me. Nancy Gonzalez:	If you don't follow up, it's not going to get done.Natalie Romero:	I know. Because ain't nobody going to do it for me.Nancy Gonzalez:	Yeah. Okay. This is it.Natalie Romero:	I know everything that I wanted to know about my family, and about what I need to do.Nancy Gonzalez:	Good. I'm glad you understand, you know where I'm coming from.Natalie Romero:	Yeah. I'm hearing it and I'm understanding it. I'm thankful that I have you. Thank you.Nancy Gonzalez:	I'm glad you're my granddaughter and that you will listen to me. Because, like I said, anything I tell you, it's for your own good, not for mine.Natalie Romero:	Yeah, I know.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
MBY006539,"Liliana:	[00:00:00] My name is Liliana Sullivan. I'm 26 years old. Today is May 23rd, 2010. We're here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I'm here with Pat Vaca, who I just met.Pat Baca:	Hi, my name is Pat Vaca. My full name is Patricio Enrique Vaca, I'm 66 years old. Today is May the 23rd, 2010. I'm here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, speaking with Liliana.Liliana:	Well, Pat, I'm really excited that you found time today to come down. We've just spent the past couple minutes, I know we just met, but we spent a couple minutes looking over these amazing family trees and documents, and beautiful photos and histories, and it seems like you've become somewhat of a family historian over the past years, is that right?Pat Baca:	It's exactly correct. I became interested in this through a cousin of mine in Las Vegas, New Mexico, Elvin court, about 10 years ago. He had written a lot of family stories and I took up from him and started to write stories. As a child, I'd always liked listening to my father and I was always asking him about what the family history was, and subsequently led me to here where I'm sitting today at the National Hispanic Cultural Center, where we were able to study our family history and actually trace our family line back here in New Mexico to 1600.Liliana:	Yeah. That's incredible. It's almost inconceivable to think about tracing your family line back to 1600. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Who is the first?Pat Baca:	Well, it's a funny story because one of my nephews wrote to me and asked me if he was doing a project on their grandfathers, and they had two generations. After we were done, we had actually discovered 16 generations of our family. Our family records went back to 1802. Then through here, we've traced it back to 1600 and confirmed what had been written by Donald Lucero in his book, The Adobe kingdom, which had the Vaca family history back to the first 1600 progenitor Cristobal Vaca. We've enjoyed doing this. Like you said, I thought it would be more difficult than it actually was, we did this in a day. We came down here early in the morning, and before three or four o'clock in the afternoon, we had all the records. We've had a stack of documents at the center here, let us copy from the books they had. Every time, one of our ancestors appeared in one of these baptismal books, marriage books, or death certificates, we were able to copy and I've got a big stack of these that shows a lot of unique things in the family background. I wrote a story, it was published for the [inaudible 00:03:05] magazine out of Santa Fe. I was asked to document if we had any child brides in our family, and I knew we had. I documented my great grandmother that was married at 15. In doing so, we did that here at the center, I discovered in the Anton Chico, New Mexico record books that  from the period 1851-1854, there were 13 marriages among Vaca's with the last name Vaca. One of them even was two Vaca families were one brother married a sister from the other family, etc. The oldest bride during that period, who was 15 years old, the youngest was 12. The grooms, the husbands were from, I think 18 to about 35 or 40.Liliana:	Now, what was it about that subjects? What were you writing about when you were writing about that?Pat Baca:	The magazine lied into it had asked they published a several, about a dozens family histories that have had the child brides, and one of them that was published had the account of, their grandmother had told the living descendant that she had been now playing with their dolls at age 11 here in New Mexico, and had been taken in the house, cleaned up, dressed up, and married that day. It was that extreme in about 150 years ago.Liliana:	Was there any story from your family that really jumped out at you?Pat Baca:	Well, my great, great grandmother was.Liliana:	What's her name?Pat Baca:	Her name was Ramoncita. She was born in Ramona Lucero, and they called her Ramoncita. She was from Anton Chico, New Mexico, and she she married my great, great grandfather. At 15, she lived to be 105 and still in that same village. [00:05:00] She died, I was told, because she was walking from one part of the village up to another part and fell in a hole and expired overnight. Didn't know where she was at, she hadn't told me, but she was going there. They found her the next morning, but she was 105 years old.Liliana:	That's amazing. Wow.Pat Baca:	The family history goes back to this. I mentioned this town of Anton Chico, it's a small village here in New Mexico of about 600 population, both of my parents, we took them back. They're buried in the Campo Santo there.Liliana:	Any idea what it's like? What kind of a villages is it?Pat Baca:	It's a 600, it's a small village, looks like it's several 100 years old. It's only about 200 years old, but it looks very old. The church, I have a book that where it says it has a picture of that church and it said that Pat Garrett was married there in 1881. Billy the Kid was there in attendance. I wrote a story about that. It's based on facts and fiction concerning that episode at my mom's funeral. However, I asked the priest how many people lived in Anton Chico, and he said about 600. I asked him, what was the most people that had ever live there at one time? He said about 600. I asked him what was the least, and he said about 600. So it's been sitting there about 600 for quite awhile.Liliana:	That's a timeless. It seems like the appropriate setting for this tree.Pat Baca:	It's an interesting community because it was part of a land grant, the Anton Chico land grant, which was one of the largest land grants in New Mexico in the early 1800s, hanging around 1830.Liliana:	Your family was part of that, is that?Pat Baca:	Right. It was taken over after the Mexican-American War. Some Anglo settlers from back East came in and somehow they got control of it, and it took about 40-50 years for the community to get any part of it back, which they did in 1906, and my great grandfather was a signatory on the re-establishment of the land grant.Liliana:	What's his name again?Pat Baca:	Fernando Vaca.Liliana:	Is he the first?Pat Baca:	He is the first, as far as I know, the first Fernando Vaca in our family. In the cemetery in Anton Chico, there are four Fernando Vacas buried there, including my father. So there are some cousins and there's my great grandfather and my father. He was quite an interesting figure of our entire family. He's the one I know the most about as far as an ancestor. He had been in the 1882 New Mexico State Legislature as a representative from the Anton Chico area. There's not my a lot that I've been able to find out as far as what he did or accomplished within the legislature but he did that. He was also a teamster taking wagon trains to Fort Dodge, within that Dodge City, Kansas, and bringing supplies back to Anton Chico and selling as a business. One of the things that he brought back in the late 1800s was a sorghum mill, a sugar producing big iron piece of machinery that was used mechanically by tying horses or a donkey to a large pole, and then the donkey walks in a circle, and they feed sugarcane into one end and out pops in the other end, this sugar is liquid. Sugar that they boiled down and they make those brown sugar from, and it was a big day in the village for the children because it would create a foam, a spuma, and then they would all line up all day long and they'd have a cup and then they would take off the foam off the top and the kids would drink this sweet drink.Liliana:	Wow.Pat Baca:	That piece of machinery is, it probably weighs 700-800 pounds. It's in my cousin's backyard to this day in Anton Chico.Liliana:	Oh my goodness. Did most villages only have one of those?Pat Baca:	Yes. Or they didn't have any. People from all over would come to this village and it was part of my great grandfather's business to process the sugar and however, they exchange that, he got a part of the crop as they usually did in those days.Liliana:	Does this still work?Pat Baca:	I don't think so. It's sitting there on the ground in just a big hunk of iron. I've seen them on the Internet is exactly the same type of machines, and it needs to be picked up and the pole and the horse and all that. They do this at Las Golondrinas up here in South of Santa Fe in the Spanish village there, which is where my great grandmother was from that village also, and they still do that to this day on the weekends to show people how they used to make sugar in the old days from sugar cane.Liliana:	That's amazing. I feel like I can really see scooping up the sugar foam. So I wanted to know, [00:10:00] I wanted to maybe slow down a little just because, I know that when I think about my family history, there are certain stories which kind of just stay with me and almost take on kind of a legend quality. Are there any stories that you've learned about your family which have really rang true with you which you might just want to pass on.Pat Baca:	Probably the most significant thing that happened in our family history is in 1924, my father's family migrated from New Mexico up to Colorado. It was the beginning right in the midst of the sugar beet industry in Colorado and they needed labor to harvest the beet and weed the fields in the summer and plant them etc.Liliana:	So your father's family, you mean.Pat Baca:	The Vaca family.Liliana:	When he was a child?Pat Baca:	He was about in 1924, he was 14 years old.Liliana:	Okay.Pat Baca:	The whole family moved to Rocky Ford. They were placed in a labor camp.Liliana:	How did they get there?Pat Baca:	There was a train from from Las Vegas, New Mexico that took him right to Mahana, Colorado and then they were taken by the truck, evidently out to Rocky Ford and into their labor camp, the train in a few years ago, about ten years ago when I was with my dad's brother, sole surviving members of the family. We were traveling to Colorado and we stopped in Trinidad, Colorado and we were in the train station, which is now a restaurant and having a meal and he's looking around and he smiled and he noticed the tile work on the wall and he says, I've been here before. We stopped here in 1924 when we came from New Mexico to Colorado. He remembered this train station.Liliana:	Had he ever told you about any of that?Pat Baca:	He was just looking around and there were some unique tile, mosaic tile and and he knows he said look at that, I remember that tile.Liliana:	Did he ever tell you what the labor camp was like?Pat Baca:	Yes, what it was is they had a Spanish word for [inaudible 00:12:00] is what they all called it [inaudible 00:12:02] and as near as I can translate it, it was like an indentured servitude type of program where they provided the transportation up there, they provided the housing, they had company store and there was a servitude that once you got indebted to that company store in the program for the housing and paying back your transportation costs etc, you are pretty much hooked to be field labored for up there until they were no longer had any use for you. That's what happened to our family. After the first year with about a dozen kids in the family, everybody working, the family was $300 in debt to the company store. At that time, after that first year, there were many Japanese American farmers in that valley. One of them came to my grandfather and told him, they asked him how much he owed the store and he told them he paid him the $300. Let me give you this money. I'll pay off the store, he gave him another couple $100 and told him to go downtown to the supermarket and buy all your groceries there and he moved the family from one, they called it La Colonia, one labor camp out his farm, and he had houses built there and they moved him into a house there and if it hadn't been for that, we may have still been in that Colonia to this day.Liliana:	He was a Japanese American farmer?Pat Baca:	He was Japanese American.Liliana:	Why did he do that?Pat Baca:	He knew that my family had a lot of good workers, a large family and respectable etc. So he picked them, evidently he watched which ones he wanted. He picked them to move and then my father, he worked for him through the Depression, through the 30s. He was an irrigation man, out there with the shovel, running the water in the fields and my father sometime also during the depression and bought his own trucks, small truck, produce truck, and was hauling produce back and forth in Southeastern Colorado to make a living.Liliana:	Wow. What were they growing?Pat Baca:	They grew a lot of onions and a lot of alfalfa that was baled into bales of hay bales. He would he would transport that to different feed yards. Bales of straw that they use for the horses and the corrals and then whatever other produce. They had their cucumbers, tomatoes, a lot of melons and in that valley, Rocky Ford melons, cantaloupe watermelon. Primarily, our family was involved in agriculture for the onions and an alfalfa harvest. The bales or hay. That's how we grew up stacking hay on summer and then in the fall and loading trucks with onions, banks of onions.Liliana:	You did it too?Pat Baca:	Oh, yes. Oh, yes.Liliana:	So you were there?Pat Baca:	Till the day I lived.Liliana:	Really? Tell me about that. [00:15:00] What do you remember from that?Pat Baca:	Since we were five or six years old, we began working in the fields in the springtime with horse weeding the fields and thinning out the number of plants, spacing the plants so they grow appropriately.Liliana:	The alfalfa?Pat Baca:	No the onions and when alfalfa seed and started using it about the day that school ended, there would be the first cutting of hay, we've got to my dad's truck and when my older brother Manuel, my old brother Ernie, my dad and I sometimes remember there Julian and my brother Philip. We would stack, pickup the bales of hay, put it on the truck, take them to the corral, and instead make a haystack there. We did this all some are from four in the morning till four in the afternoon. We do 12 loads of hay a day and then a full day in Saturday and a half a day on Sunday. We'd worked eight hours on Saturday, we did eight loads on Sunday and it would lead right into the onion harvest in August, the onions would start to be harvested and we'd move from hay over to onions and we'd loaded trucks with onions all during the fall season up until around thanksgiving. Then they would store some in sheds. They would grade them later. We'd load trucks right in through the holidays. So it was almost about eight months of the season. In January, we would go to a shed where they fixed crates, wooden crates, folding crates. They had a lot of broken ones and we'd sit there for a couple of months just fixing crates, thousands of crates. They had wire, you need tools and they take the slides that were broken, remove them and rewire new ones in their, fixed the bottoms, nail the slides from the bottoms, and then we would do that for a couple of months.Liliana:	When you saying we, do mean?Pat Baca:	Saying my family, my dad, my brother Philip, my brother Ernie. My brother Manuel during high school was in a Seminary in Pueblo, Colorado studying for the priesthood. But he missed out on all the winter. So he was there for the summer for all the work we had to do in the summer.Liliana:	I'm just curious. Well, you must have been what 12?Pat Baca:	We all started at five or six years old and as soon as we could walk and the first chore that you had was being the water boy carrying a canvas water bag to the workers that were out on their knees up and down these rows of onions or sugar beet plants and they call for water, hey water boy and you run up there and then give them drink of water and then you sit down, fall asleep until you heard them call you for again. You'd run again to take if somebody else would drink the water, that's how you started.Liliana:	Did you enjoy the work?Pat Baca:	I couldn't leave there soon enough.Liliana:	Speak about it.Pat Baca:	Well, it's something that is now our history and that you can really laugh at. At the time it was a grueling, they'd call it abusive, I guess, childhood raising today. But in those days that our generation and my father's generation, everybody had to participate, everybody had to contribute and we all paid our way. My father, when we were in high school and hauling onions and hale all year long, we would be paid about an average around five dollars a week and he was paying help that we had hired a dollar an hour and they were making a $100 a week. We were working a 100 hours a week, every week. He'd pay out the crew and they get a 100 and we get five. Then he would say this is for your laundry and this is for the all the food and your bed. So he had it all accounted for us and what's left is the five dollars. So everything went to the family and to support the family and then whatever little was left we would get it. Most of us left there and not looking back. Myself and my brother Julian, and my oldest brother Fernando joined the Marines. My brother Ernie and Philip joined the army. There was a means of escape. It wasn't to seeking a career or being military people nothing like that. It was the way to get out of town, basically what happened to us.Liliana:	What did your folks think when you left?Pat Baca:	It was time to leave. There was never any shedding of tears or remorse or anything. You grew up, you did all you could and then when it was your time to leave, you left. You asked about experiences in our lifetime that were important. My mother suffered a major stroke in 1958 and at age 44.Liliana:	[00:20:00] What's your mother's name?Pat Baca:	Martha Vaca. Mercedes Gutierrez was her maiden name. She had a stroke at this young age and her right side was paralyzed and she was never able to speak again. She she could utter a few words, etc. She outlived my father by 19 years. My father died in 1978 at age 68. My mom lived for almost 40 years, 39 years and six months after having the stroke and being paralyzed and she died in a nursing home in California in 1997.Liliana:	How old were you then when your mother had a stroke?Pat Baca:	I was 14?Liliana:	Oh, you were young.Pat Baca:	We were a large family. I was 14. My younger sister, Cynthia was about 12. Kathy was around six or seven, and I had a youngest brother, Jose, that was two years old when she had that stroke. So I left home shortly after about four years later, I was gone. But the three younger siblings, all paid dearly for that with mom having that stroke, it was quite a tough childhood the rest of their childhood growing up. My little brother completely absorbed in that life with a mother that couldn't speak?Liliana:	Yes, how did it affect your family?Pat Baca:	We learned to deal with it. She still continued to work in the home. She couldn't work with us in the fields or anything, but she continued to do laundry and clean house and cook and dragging her leg around from room-to-room, doing that, making beds, whatever. She continued to contribute. She was a very strong woman, very influential in her nature to all of us children as much so as my father, they were both of that streak of an independence in a strong-willed nature that you hardly see today. The other things that happened to us with my dad's generation in Colorado once they got there to Colorado in their 20s, there was a lot of tuberculosis going around and a lot of them, two or three of them died. They were like 13 or 14, 13 children and his family, siblings and two or three of them died of tuberculosis early in life in their teens and 20s and three or four brothers took off and just to get out of there to not die and the rest of the family in the late '30s, about 1936, 1937, they moved to California for the same purpose to avoid this tuberculosis primarily that was going around. So they it was a big change in our family and I'm sure with other families had the same situation.Liliana:	What was your father's family situation like at that time?Pat Baca:	We were working on the farm and working in the field, working for the Harada family, the Japanese family I mentioned.Liliana:	So this was your family then?Pat Baca:	This was my dad's family and the beginning of my siblings.Liliana:	Got it.Pat Baca:	These were My aunts and uncles and then in the '30s, my oldest brother was born in 1933. So during the '30s and my father was already starting his family and at the same time, most of his siblings were leaving town, getting out as fast as they could before they died from tuberculosis.Liliana:	So you all went out to California?Pat Baca:	Right? Except us we stayed, our family didn't go. My mom and dad, they stayed there and we'd survive. Nobody died of TB. My dad had ended up later in life in his 60s, shortly before he died of cancer, he was in a TB ward in California for several months. But that was the only time that any of us contracted TB although back then in the '30s, there were several that died from it. So that was a major thing that happened to people from New Mexico, I think that went up there. It wasn't just us. I think several others had the same thing happen to them and they lost family members too, because it was going around evidently pretty strong.Liliana:	That must have been terrifying?Pat Baca:	Yeah. Then we always had a strong family culture as far as our who we were as a Vaca family, it was a name that was for whatever reason, was beyond what I knew that as I grew up, it was [00:25:00] respected name there in town. My father was referred to as Don Fernando. I don't know if you're familiar with the Don title. It comes from the Spanish ""de origen noble"" D-O-N and it referred to a back in Spain is usually people from the royal family that were of noble origins. Then here in America, it was the big landowners here in New Mexico that had that title. Then as the generations have passed, what happened is that title began being used in local villages, small villages towards those elders that had earned it through hard work, through fair mindedness, through kindness, whatever respect and only certain people in the village would get that. There were more than one that had it. But it was always somebody that was honest and was respected and they wouldn't refer to them as Don Fernando or Don whatever. I remember as a child, my friends come into my house like say sixth, seventh grade and and referring to my dad as Don Fernando and I didn't tell him to say that and my mom, Doña Martha. So it was just something that I knew that gave us a lot of self-esteem, a lot of good feeling about who we were. Even though in that community and that culture of Rocky Ford, Colorado, there was a definite distinction between Hispanic people and Anglo people.Liliana:	How so?Pat Baca:	Well, early on, around when I was five or six years old in Rocky Ford, the theater, Hispanics had to sit in the balcony on one particular side. You couldn't sit down on the ground floor or on the other side of the balcony, we were restricted to that. There was a roller skating rink in the neighboring town, La Habana Colorado, that had Hispanic night or Mexican night on only one night like Monday night, you could only skate there. They wanted your money. They wanted business. But you had to go there when they told you to go. You couldn't go there anytime you wanted.Liliana:	Who lived in the town you said was it mostly Anglos and Hispanics? Or like half and half.Pat Baca:	Yes. It was population-wise, by the time I grew up, it was probably about half and half. There were a lot of Hispanic kids, but there were a lot of the farmers were mostly Anglo farmers. The businessmen in town, they were all Anglo's. Then the Japanese culture, there was a lot of Japanese farmers. We had a lot of lower German immigrant farmers there. There were Russian people that were there. How they got there, I don't know, but they were part of the community. It was a pretty diversified community, but it was divided straight down the middle is as you're Hispanic. We weren't called Hispanics we were just called Mexicans. There was a distinct line there that, you are over here and you stayed over here. There was also religion wise, the most Hispanics were Catholics and most of the Anglo's were protestant of one faith or the other one denomination to the other. So there was a great divide in growing up there, a great prejudicial divide, and classing of us and them.Liliana:	Did you live in separate areas of town?Pat Baca:	No, we lived on a farm where my my folks bought a farm after World War II. My dad went to World War II at age 33 with seven children at home. He was drafted in the army in January of 1944, right after I was born in November, and he served in Europe under General George Patton, and General Patton's third Army, the 95th infantry division. I have a certificate at home that was signed by George Patton sent to Fernando Vaca that you were there during the Battle of the Bulge. Anyhow, they bought the farm with his mastery now pay when he got out of the army, a five acre farm and we lived out there and we were the only Hispanic family within a half a mile or so. Then they purchased another farm later on. But most of the Hispanic people that had come from New Mexico, the majority of them still ended up in one labor camp or the other, still in debt to those company stores. It was a really terrible situation for them. Kids that I grew up with and whose families came there at the same time as mine had never been able to escape the indentured service because of that bill they owed at the store.Liliana:	Can I just ask one more question about that?Pat Baca:	Sure.Liliana:	So I'm wondering about if growing up as kids, did you play with all kinds of people and work with all kinds of people?Pat Baca:	It's a good question [00:30:00] because as you're asking me that, just prior to this I was thinking, during recess in grade school, we go out and choose sides like kids do for soccer, football, whatever. It would be Spanish against the white. Because a lot of the Hispano kids were a couple years older, had been passed over, so they were a little more aggressive and a little bigger in grade school. The Anglo kids didn't want to play that way, they wanted to mix it up then. It was something that we had an edge early on. We soon lost as we got into high school and all these guys who had been passed over dropped out and then it was the rest of us having to compete on an equal basis like everybody else.Liliana:	I recently heard sports referred to as the great equalizer, and I think I'm starting to see that. How about Japanese-American kids?Pat Baca:	They were pretty much integrated, but also separate from Anglos. They had a Japanese store in town that we used to buy our firecrackers from, fireworks in the 4th of July. They were just good neighbors, good people. I don't know of any, I can't speak of anyone that I had any bad feelings about ever. They treated everybody fairly, they were solid people, they were intelligent, they scored high in school, and it was really a great experience having them and also growing up with them. Some of my best friends were from the Japanese families, very nice kids. Anyhow, I wanted to also just say that in studying family history, I've written several stories that were published in Laherencia magazine out of Santa Fe. It's no longer in publication, but it can still be accessed on the Internet @laherencia.com. That's L-A-H-E-R-E-N-C-I-A.Liliana:	Yeah, you showed me some. I just want to say for the sake of the recording, they look really beautiful and they have some gorgeous family photos in them. They look really amazing.Pat Baca:	Right. The editor of that magazine, Ana Pacheco, did a great service to the people, Hispanic people of New Mexico. It ran for about 15 years and there are stories of every community here in New Mexico in that magazine, it was a quarterly publication. I always felt that I was honored that she published my story, I didn't know that I had anything worthy of being published, but she really enjoyed the writing that I did. Like I said, you can still purchase a CD of all their issues for very reasonable. The other thing I wanted to say is that in studying our family history, the Vaca family in particular, there's a book I mentioned, The Adobe kingdom by Donald Lucero. The title of that book is The Adobe kingdom history, the Vaca and Lucero family histories from 1598 to 1958. So the Luceros first came here two years before the Vacas, it covers that whole period. Dr. Lucero is a professor and he lives in Connecticut now, and he just reprinted, republished that book. It's available if people want to go on Internet and get a copy of it. It's a great book, not just Vaca and Lucero families, but it tells a lot of history. Another book, another last thing I wanted to mention. It's a kind of an interesting thing that happened in the 1600s here in New Mexico, there was a Governor Rosas that was very corrupt around 1638-1640. What happened is, there was a very beautiful girl in Santa Fe that was a Vaca married to a northeast man. What happened is, he took a liking to her and then he would send her husband out on expedition against the Indians, and then he called her to the palace and he had his way with her under threat of if she didn't cooperate with him, he would keep sending her husband until the Indians killed him, till he didn't survive one of these expeditions. So she went along with it and then it turned out that she became pregnant. The family found out about it, they attacked the Governor's palace. The Ortiz family, the Vaca family, about five or six families that were related. There were several people killed, I'm not sure how many on each side. The attackers lost about a dozen people, and then they were more than that. They killed the governor, Governor Rosas was killed. As a result of that, 12 of the attackers were captured [00:35:00] and sentenced to death. Of the 12, four of them escaped and eight of them were beheaded. Then after a certain amount of time, the four that had escaped returned to Santa Fe, and after the dust had settled and everybody knew the government from Mexico came up, investigated and they found out that the governor was at fault, so they didn't charge them after that, but eight were beheaded. The reason I'm telling the story is that one of the ones had escaped, Alonso Vaca, was the son of Cristobal Vaca, the first Vaca that came here in 1600. He escaped and we're descended from Alonso Vaca. His brother, Manuel, was not as lucky. He was one of the ones that was beheaded. But for his escaping, I wouldn't be here today. The other thing about the Vaca family name in New Mexico, it's one of the most prolific names probably in all of New Mexico, I don't know why. It just seems that everywhere you go, you run into Vacas. That's why I mentioned this Adobe Kingdom book, because you can trace back, not only your line, but where your family line broke off and where the historical figures like Elfego Vaca that was the sheriff there down in Reserve, New Mexico in the late 1800s, and his exploits and colorful history. He also descended from Cristobal Vaca, and he's also a distant cousin. The other thing lastly would be that, a lot of people think they're descended from Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, that was the first European to come into this area in 1528. He never had any male offspring, so we're not descended from him, but he's probably a distant uncle of some kind, but he was the first European. Our family name was the first ones that came through here back in 1528. That's another complete story, a very colorful eight-year lost track because they went from the Indian tribe to Indian tribe. He ended up back in Mexico with Spanish sailors there, he was sent to South America, he was in Uruguay. He wrote a book about being up here, book about Uruguayan, and then he retired as a Justice of some kind in Spain at the end of his life before he died.Liliana:	This is just so amazing, all your research. It's strange because on one hand there, there are a lot of dates and names. But on the other hand, it's the stuff of legends. So I'm curious, what do you love about studying your family history? What do you hope if someone in the future, maybe your descendants listen to this recording. What do you want to share with them about this?Pat Baca:	I believe the most important part of family history and keeping in touch with who you are, where you come from, is it gives you a greater feeling of who you are today. A lot of times we're subjected in our culture to discrimination or we're left out, prejudice or whatever. We begin to buy in to the fact that maybe we're not equal to some other group. When you study your history and you see what colorful and great history you actually come from, the people, the hard work and this work ethic that they had, although they speak a lot of protest in work ethic, there's this great ethic in our culture as any of the work ethic as any that I've ever experienced. I think that is the most important thing that kids not forget where they came from and be able to go back and find out for themselves. Do the research yourself, go back, find these records. That's why I continually mentioned the [inaudible 00:39:11] source stuff and where they can do it. Now with the internet, it's just amazing that the things they can find out, and how fast and how easy. It's not hard.Liliana:	Yeah. I think this is a great start that you are giving people to start hearing about these stories of your family. I really want to thank you for talking today.Pat Baca:	Sure, I thank you for giving me the opportunity.Liliana:	Thanks so much.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
MBY006540,"Kyber:	[00:00:00] Holá mi maestra, mi amiga, y my mamá adoptiva. I'll introduce myself first. I'm Kyber [inaudible 00:00:13] , I am 31 years old. The date today is May 23rd, 2010, we're in Albuquerque at the Hispanic Cultural Center and I'm going to turn the mic over to Adriana to introduce herself, especially with her full name.Adriana Martinez:	Bueno Kyber, me da much gustó estar aquí contigo and My name is Gillermina Adriana Calderon Martinez.Kyber:	How do we know each other and how old are you?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, I thought you were going to skip that skip little question. I'm 63 years old.Kyber:	How do we know each other?Adriana Martinez:	How do we know each other? It's a very nice, cute story. Do you want me to start from the beginning?Kyber:	Yes, but we should cut right to the chase.Adriana Martinez:	Okay. Well, it was just very funny. When I moved here to Albuquerque, my aunt Bibita which is my youngest mother's sister, wanted me to have an address from a nephew of hers, but I didn't have the time, so I moved here. I didn't bring that information with me and then after a while, the lady at the bank told me that somebody was interested in taking some Spanish classes and that's how I met Kyber and Marin, which is Kyber's wife. Then I started working with him in the Spanish classes and then all of the sudden somebody else was interested and then I was introduced to her. One day they asked me over to have some dinner with them and that's when the story starts getting very funny.Kyber:	Oh, we should add that that was Marin's office mate Alana.Adriana Martinez:	That's correct.Kyber:	So from Betty to Me to Alana, and Alana's husband is Luis.Adriana Martinez:	That's correct. That's how I get to find the relatives that my aunt Bibita wanted me to get to know here in Albuquerque. I think that's an amazing story. Things that really can tell you that they were meant to happen.Kyber:	You were speaking to Luis's parents and you found out you had a common village?Adriana Martinez:	Yeah. Because I was at the house and then all of the sudden I hear a little voice and then Alana says, ""Here are my in-laws."" So I'm introduced to them and I don't know, I got that weird feeling and he is  Padilla Gonzales. My aunt Bibita's husband is Gonzalez Padilla and that's how I started asking questions. I said, ""You're from Mexico City, how weird."" My uncle Javier and then Luis' father, Alana's father-in-law is when he said, ""Well, he is my cousin,"" and here we are.Kyber:	So it was meant to be.Adriana Martinez:	It was meant to be.Kyber:	Also interesting, I didn't plan on mentioning this, but my family has Jewish descent and you happen to be half Jewish?Adriana Martinez:	Yes. Very, very interesting topic because of my father's mother, which she is from Spain, from Sevilla, and she was Jewish. My father got married with my mother that she is Catholic. So it is a very interesting background because I don't know the beginning and the end together, so I don't see too much difference.Kyber:	Well, let's talk about your growing up. Let's talk about your father and the beautiful, almost like compound that your family grew up on.Adriana Martinez:	Well, I think I was very blessed. I had a beautiful childhood. I grew up in beautiful place in a part of Mexico City, which is the district of Tlalpan. A beautiful little town and it's part of Mexico City from the city. We were 17 grandchildren. We grew up together. There were five houses. We had a beautiful, beautiful [00:05:00] childhood.Kyber:	Both of your parents seem like really interesting people. I wish I had a chance to meet them.Adriana Martinez:	Oh, yeah. My mother was a very, very, very unique person. She loved to read. As a matter of fact, she would always say that she had traveled around the world several times because of the reading and her father was also an amazing person. I don't know. I can only tell you beautiful things about my family. They were very different, my mother and my father. My mother was born November the 4th, my father November the 9th, and I was born November the 12. So we were three Scorpios and I live practically all my life with them till they departed from this world.Kyber:	You were a wild child.Adriana Martinez:	Oh yes. I have no regrets. Like the song says, I did it all and it's a beautiful story too with the ups and downs but yes, I consider myself very lucky.Kyber:	With your parents, were they worried for you during your crazy years?Adriana Martinez:	I think they were, but at the same time, they gave me a lot of confidence. They trusted me and I'm grateful for that. Even though I had many years that I left, I went to San Miguel de Allende to study jewelry, ceramics and then it's when I started my Spanish tutoring. Then I went to New England and then to Canada and after all those crazy years, I ended up back again home with my parents.Kyber:	What is your fondest memory of your parents?Adriana Martinez:	Well, they we're very happy together, but at the same time, they were very funny. My mother used to get very mad at him and sometimes when she would get upset, she would call him Calderon. She was very funny because she would say in Spanish, ""¡Ya me tienes arta! Para lo que e de durar en este convento, me zurro adentro. Bien me lo decía mi papasito, no te cases con este hombre, pero,"" They were very happy for 54 years of marriage. My father was very different. He was more calm and he would rub his mustache. I remember one day that my mother very upset, she will always say ""¡Ya me tienes arta! Perdón por mi Español pero siempre acostumbraba a decírle, traga mierda Calderon ya me tienes arta."" And I remember one day that my father started rubbing his mustache and then he said, ""Sabes una cosa chavita, despues de 25 años de mandarme a tragar mierda, fíjate que ya me esta gustando.""  and they both started laughing. They couldn't live apart each other. They were beautiful people.Kyber:	You had a nickname. You were La Flaca?Adriana Martinez:	La Flaca. That was my father's. Flaca because I was skinny once but then you change. Nothing can remain the same.Kyber:	While we're working with Spanish, can you tell me some of their favorite expressions which I know are your favorite expressions now too?Adriana Martinez:	From who? From my mother?Kyber:	From your parents.Adriana Martinez:	From my parents?Kyber:	Like about things you shouldn't do on martes.Adriana Martinez:	""Los martes, ni te cases ni te embarques, ni de tu casa te apartes."" [00:10:00] Which is funny because when you have to work, it's difficult. In the end, also, it was ""Con la barra que mides, seras medido.""FEMALE_1:	Do you want to mention what those mean in English too? If anyone who.Adriana Martinez:	Okay. On Tuesdays, it's supposed for a los martes. You're not supposed to leave your house, you're not supposed to go abroad, and you're not supposed to get married because martes is, Tuesdays are bad luck to do those things. Then with the measurement that you will judge others, with that same measurement, you are going to be judged.Kyber:	Mi favorito es, ""¿A dónde va Vicente--""Adriana Martinez:	""A dónde va la gente?"" That means when you don't have personality and because a bunch of people is going one side, you're going to follow the people. Now, you have to be yourself. You're not going to do what others do just because others do. You have to be yourself. You have to be Adriana, you have to be unique, you have to learn to be yourself.Kyber:	You are unique.FEMALE_1:	What are your parents names?Adriana Martinez:	My father's name is Guillermo Calderon Villegas. My mother's name is Isaura Carlota Martinez.Kyber:	Your brother and sister?Adriana Martinez:	I have an older sister which is Sonia Marcella Calderon Martinez. I'm in the middle and then I have a younger brother. His name is Jose Guillermo Calderon Martinez. Because I was born in November the 12, after my father's birthday. That's why he named me Guillermina. So my father is Guillermo, I'm Guillermina, my brother is Guillermoso. I think it was the Guillermo's domain.Kyber:	What was your relationship like growing up with your siblings?Adriana Martinez:	It was nice, but we were very different. Marcella, my sister, she was always the perfect one. There are no mistake in Marcella's world. Guillermo was the youngest one. So it was like we were brothers, but we always were very apart from each other. Kyber:	Okay. So you moved out of your house and you got married?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, yeah. It was sad experience because it was like a dream. It happened too fast. He was my my first love and then we got married. I remember my father being very unhappy, but I got married and six months after I was having my divorce. It was not a good experience.Kyber:	You're going to say anymore about that or would you like to move on to next?Adriana Martinez:	Well, it's up to you if you want me to. I don't mind telling the sad part of the story because in those six months, I lived a really true nightmare. He tried to kill me four times and he was a very unhappy person. Then I found out that unfortunately, and I don't mean unfortunately for the reason that I'm going talk about right now. Unfortunately, he was pushed to get married with me because he was in the closet and he was a homosexual. That's why, I mean that unfortunately, all these things happened, because they were not meant to happen [00:15:00] that way. We're talking over 40 years ago. So that's why it's so different.Kyber:	When does Juano come into the picture?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, my darling. My darling was born 31 years ago. He's the love of my life, but he's being also trouble, unfortunately. My son got hooked up with drugs, when he was 18 years old. It's been very tough for him, but he keeps trying and I keep hoping for the better, and I know it's going to happen.Kyber:	Can you talk about when you last saw him?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, that's bad. It's going to be seven years ago that I don't see my son, but it's been worth it. Everything that you do for your children, sooner or later you're going to get rewarded. I know that it's been good for him too, and I know that one day we're going to be back together. I know.Kyber:	I remember you telling me that you thought that it would be better for him in his growth for you two to be apart for a time?Adriana Martinez:	Yes. It's a very hard decision and not everybody has to do the same decision. This is something very personal. So I had to be wise. I have to use my brains and to decide if I was going to let him drag me along with him, or if I was going to be strong enough to let him go so that he could mature. That was the only way that I was going to get him back as a grown up, as a man.Kyber:	Now you're talking regularly again, and there's talk of maybe you seeing him in Mexico.Adriana Martinez:	Oh, yes. The contact, we have never lose contact. He calls me, he's a sweet boy. He still calls me mom, and I support him all the way, and I know that he's trying very hard. Right now, he's leaving in Playa del Carmen in Quintana Roo, Mexico. He's at a rehab in which I know I have a feeling that something good is going to happen.Kyber:	Let me ask you about another important man in your life. Can you talk about Charlie?Adriana Martinez:	Charlie. Charlie was the little disarray that God gave me. He was a beautiful man. Yes, he was. He was much younger than me and we have a very exciting woman's affair. He was a beautiful person that he loved me very much. I loved him very much.Kyber:	How long were you together?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, we were together close to six years. Then unfortunately, a drunk driver took his life away.Kyber:	You remain so close with Charlie's mom?Adriana Martinez:	Oh, yes, and that was what brought you to Albuquerque? She didn't want me to stay behind in Texas. Because we were living in Texas in a little town at the very end of the United States, in the border with Mexico, which is McAllen, Texas. That's where I met Mrs. Connor, Martha, and Connor, Charlie's mother, and she brought me here. That's the reason why I came here to New Mexico.Kyber:	Well, you've lived in Mexico, you've lived here, you've lived close to the border. What are your feelings about [00:20:00] these two countries and how you identify with both of them?Adriana Martinez:	Well, my roots are going to remain with me here forever. But to tell you the truth, I don't know why I've been in so many different places, but the only thing that I can tell you is that they're all being good to me, all of them. If I've been in my hometown. If I've been in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, in New England, in Canada, in New Mexico, they're all being good to be.Kyber:	Have you ever been scared to be in a new place or go to a new place?Adriana Martinez:	That's the amazing thing. Life is about changes. Humans we are very funny, when we make even a wrong turn when you're driving, that totally fix you up, you feel lost. If the weather changes, if you miss a plane, those things are our life. I'm not amazed for changes, I think I was born to have changes in my life, drastic changes in my life. I adapt and make the best out of it.Kyber:	Tell me about this phase of your life here. You've been in Albuquerque how long now?Adriana Martinez:	Six and a half years. I got here in November the 13, 2003. All I can tell you is that nothing personal. But I don't like too much Albuquerque, but I love the people that I have met here in Albuquerque. They're all beautiful.Kyber:	Is it too a big city compared to other places you've been?Adriana Martinez:	It's just very different. When you are used to be close to the beach, the palm trees, the humidity, the mosquitoes, and then you come to the opposite side of the weather that it's very dry, there is a totally different picture. But the people is, it's so beautiful. I like the cultures together, they mix together. I love that it's a lot of things going on culturally. There's a lot of things going on and I love it.Kyber:	You stay busy. You briefly had a jewelry business.Adriana Martinez:	Yes. I've been through, like I said, my life is about changes. I came here to work as a substitute teacher and then I had a little business with a woman from Mexico in Santa Fe. Then I started working for the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce. After that, I'm working with my aunt Bibita's relative, which is a doctor. He practices women's cancer and surgical care. I love it. I work as a document management. I like it every day more.Kyber:	You are tireless. You get there first among everyone?Adriana Martinez:	Yes. I'm a very early person. I get there at seven o'clock in the morning. I turn the lights on, I turn my music on, I put the coffee, and then everybody starts coming in and I love the people that I work with.Kyber:	You are also an excellent Spanish tutor on top of everything else that you do. So we've been meeting two hours a week for three years now.Adriana Martinez:	Yes. But like I told you once, I'm going to tell you again. There's no such a thing as a good teacher or a bad teacher. It's about the student. The student is the one that makes you good or he makes you bad. So I owe it to you.Kyber:	That's kind of you to say. Well, along the lines of our lessons, I wanted to mention that we've done many things together. We've gone to see movies [00:25:00] in Spanish, we've rented movies in Spanish. We've cooked together. Can you tell me some of your specialty dishes?Adriana Martinez:	Well, remember the time that we made that flan, it was delicious.Kyber:	I'll never look at flan the same way again, seeing how hard it was to make.Adriana Martinez:	Well, let's not advertise. But there's a place in town that they have the best flan.Kyber:	All right, let's advertise.Adriana Martinez:	Okay.Kyber:	We always go to Los Equipales for birthdays.Adriana Martinez:	Birthday, that's right. It's a treat for us.Kyber:	Adriana is Loraina Adriana and Esther [inaudible 00:25:40] .Adriana Martinez:	I don't know why they love me so much at Los Equipales, that they treat me like royalty, like I'm very important. I don't think they treat the mayor's wife as good as they treat me.Kyber:	But everywhere we go, I think it's like that. Remember we went to that ranch, that big store that you felt like you were in Mexico? That ranch market?Adriana Martinez:	Yeah.Kyber:	You struck up a conversation with the two people we were sitting down next to. Everywhere we go, you make friends.Adriana Martinez:	But do you remember how funny it was that I was waiting, making some time before our class and then I said, I'm going to stop by at this ranch marketplace that they have mentioned it to me so many times. So I went in, and instantly, I ran back to my car and I went to pick you up and I said, ""Kyber,  let's go."" ""Where are we going, Adriana?"" ""We're going to Mexico, Kyber, get in, hop in the car."".Kyber:	Field trip.Adriana Martinez:	It was nice. You were impressed.Kyber:	I was. We had a great time. I think we should mention that you love to drive. You love to be in your car, listening to music, and be on the road.Adriana Martinez:	Yeah. Especially when we go to San Diego, and you have all the beautiful music from my years, the '60s, then we take, [inaudible 00:27:14] .Kyber:	We have to back up, we have to explain this. So I was going to LA because my brother, [inaudible 00:27:21] lives there and my cousin Kiara was putting on a play. I said, ""Adriana, I'm driving to LA, do you want to drive to California too?"" You said that you wanted to visit your cousins in San Diego.Adriana Martinez:	Yeah.Kyber:	So we took [inaudible 00:27:36] , my four-year-old now, [inaudible 00:27:40] that you adore so much. We had a road trip together.Adriana Martinez:	It was fun.Kyber:	We were great together as road trip companions.Adriana Martinez:	Yeah. It's not easy to find a good companion to travel. Usually at the end, I remember my grandmother, my mother's mother saying, ""Don't travel with your best friends because what it's going to happen at the end is that you're going to lose your friend."" It's so true. To travel with somebody, it is not easy.Kyber:	You might have wanted to lose me as a friend when we got lost in Phoenix, and we both, but you weren't happy with that city at that moment.Adriana Martinez:	I don't know. Maybe I'm going to sound too cocky, but I don't think I'm going to lose you for any simple silly reason. I'll forgive you anything.FEMALE_1:	What makes you guys so close? What makes your friendship and your relationship work?Adriana Martinez:	Well, that's a tough question. It's just things like this just happened. Even though we're very different in culture, it is something that it just happened from the beginning.Kyber:	I think we're both interested in each other. I'm interested in you. I want to know more about you. I want to hear your stories, which is why we're here. I feel like you find me very interesting. You tell me that I'm not like a lot of other people you've known.Adriana Martinez:	I just wanted to leave it as it was. You're touching a very sensitive topic. That for me, on my behalf, I think that you have replaced that empty little hole that I have in my heart because I can't touch my son, I can't hold him, I can't talk to him, like I do with you and you are his same age. Your [00:30:00] wife also, she's been very good and beautiful to me. So you give me a lot of warmth and you acknowledge me. For people my age, these days, when you're young, your speed is always very different as mine. So I don't know. I love you guys for everything.Kyber:	We love you too so much. We came here not knowing anyone. We were only here a week when I said to Betty at the bank, ""Do you know anyone who I could have as a conversation partner?""Adriana Martinez:	Well.Kyber:	You came here not really having family and here we've created a little family.Adriana Martinez:	But God always sends me. Maybe we had something in another life. I see it that way.Kyber:	Remember when you brought over the video, the silent movies of your childhood?Adriana Martinez:	You're the only one that has seen that. Okay. You are the only one.Kyber:	You pointed out who all the different cousins were.Adriana Martinez:	Yeah, all my relatives and everybody else. So I'm very thankful.Kyber:	When you were growing up there, what did you think your life was going to be?Adriana Martinez:	Well, that I was going to get marry and that was going to be happily forever that my husband was going to take care of me. I was going to have my children. I never thought I was going to be here, there, and everywhere, and I don't regret it. I would like to have my house with my birds and my dog, and my husband and my grandchildren, but not because I don't have them, I'm supposed to be miserable because I have what my friends that they have had, their house and the dogs and the grandchildren, they will like to have what I have, you know what I'm saying?Kyber:	Let's talk about a few other specific things I know about you. You collect crosses.Adriana Martinez:	Yeah. My little crosses and churches. I also collect little churches.Kyber:	Tell me where some of the crosses and churches came from?Adriana Martinez:	Okay. The churches that I have from here, from New Mexico, there were given to me from my dear darling, Mrs. Connor, Charlie's mother. Then I have some other little collection from the cathedrals from Colombia. Those were given to me from a friend in McAllen, Texas. She is from Colombia. Then I have mine, which those I have collected over the years is the ones from Mexico.Kyber:	You also have a lot of plants.Adriana Martinez:	I love plants.Kyber:	You take very good care of plants.Adriana Martinez:	Yes, and I always name them. Okay. Right now, my baby is Isabella. If I would've had a daughter, I wouldn't name her Isabella. Yes.Kyber:	Quiet time is very important to you. You like to go home from work and be by yourself. You have TV shows you like to watch.Adriana Martinez:	Yes.Kyber:	That's another thing I want to say about why I think we're drawn to each other, is I think you and I are both very curious about the world and you are constantly learning. You'll see a TV show about history or about geography, and you want to tell me all about it.Adriana Martinez:	The environment, also, I love investigative programs. I love to learn about the technology.Kyber:	You love conspiracy theories.Adriana Martinez:	Right now I'm hooked with The Tudors. Let me tell you, it is about one of the craziest kings from England.Kyber:	We've had some heated political conversations.Adriana Martinez:	Yes. Don't touch that subject.Kyber:	Well, if I can summarize, you have a jaded view of politicians. You've seen a lot of corruption in your days.Adriana Martinez:	My grandfather, my mother's father, worked for the politicians [00:35:00] all his life and he was a very tough man. My father's father also. But it's too sad, the older you get, the more you don't understand how can things.Kyber:	Yet as you get older, you're so young at heart. I think everyone who meets you knows that.Adriana Martinez:	Well, that's also in your nature. You know what I'm saying? Life is tough.Kyber:	I think this is the perfect chance to say your expression, ""Life is?""Adriana Martinez:	Can I say it?Kyber:	I think you can.Adriana Martinez:	Okay. I had a friend in Texas. This is from Texas that they say, ""Life is a bitch and then you die."" Well, no, I didn't like that. I told my friend, well, life is a bitch, well, so am I.Kyber:	I think that's your motto.Adriana Martinez:	That's the way to go.Kyber:	Well, we only have a few more minutes left. Let me ask you. So this is going to be in the Library of Congress. Let's say Juano has children and his children someday listen to this recording, what would you like to say to them?Adriana Martinez:	Well, what can I say? Just for them to listen so they will have the opportunity to get to know another side of the grandma one day.Kyber:	What do you think the world will look like then?Adriana Martinez:	I don't want to think. Unfortunately, it's not good, but you never know. That's the way we've been since we started before The Tudors and after The Tudors. So politics is a gamble. We'll see, I don't want to say nothing is just for them to do the right thing and we'll meet again.Kyber:	Does anything else come to mind that you would like to talk about when you look back on your life?Adriana Martinez:	Well really, there's so many things and I'm just very thankful for being here with you, for giving me this opportunity, like always. It's nice and it's beautiful.Kyber:	 El placer es mío, did I say that correctly?Adriana Martinez:	El placer es mío. Pues el placer es mutuo, okay?FEMALE_1:	Can I ask one question? Cara, what would you like Adriana's grandchildren to know about her if they listen to this, or what would you like anyone to know about her?Kyber:	I would like them to know that there's no one else like Adriana. I feel so blessed that she came into my life through such a coincidence and the fact that we're from a different culture, and we have these two languages we're working with has enriched everything between us that we teach each other and we learn from each other. Adriana has so much love to give and it was really important to me that how we record her history, her ""historia"", because she's a wonderful storyteller with terrific expressions. I felt like it needed to go beyond me. I didn't want to be the only recipient of all her wisdom and needed to outlive both of us. Muchas gracias, Adriana.Adriana Martinez:	God bless you, Kyber. I love you.Kyber:	I love you too.Adriana Martinez:	Gracias a ti. .",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
MBY006541,"JOHN:	[00:00:00] Hello. I'm John, I'm 18. Today's May 23rd, 2010. We're here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm with my grandpa.JERRY GONZALEZ:	Hello. My name is Jerry Gonzalez, I'm 74 years of age. Today's date is May 23rd, 2010 in Albuquerque, in New Mexico. I'm here with my grandson, John.JOHN:	What was your childhood like?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I'll tell you what, I was born in 1936 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was actually birthed in my great grandmother's home. My great grandmother was actually a midwife who assisted my mother when I was born and my father. Unfortunately, the doctor who was supposed to come and sign the birth certificate failed to do so. For many years, I was considered non-existence I guess, until I applied for a visa and they couldn't find any record of me. So I had to go back to the basilica in Santa Fe, check all the different records that they have to prove that really I did exist. Back in those days a lot of things like that happened. There was quite a few of us who were born around the same time. That occurred to all of us. So we were prone to it by then you could say. What I remember most is back when I was about to start school and at that time that's when World War II had broke out, everybody was getting really patriotic. We had to do with a lot of stuff, sugar. The women couldn't get, nylons, where gasoline was very scarce. It was a hard situation but everybody seemed to be in tune to doing their patriotic part. I remember to buy gas, you had to have stamps. If you didn't have stamps no matter if you had money, you couldn't get it. In fact, shoes were hard to come by and different things that we needed. One of the things I remember a lot is like, no sugar. We used to use a lot of honey or whatever else was available to us. Another thing that I remember was when we started school, a lot of times the shoes would get a little worn out and somehow they would go to the store and buy a new sole for them and they try to glue them. But then when winter came along, the glue, it wasn't super glue I guess, because that thing would start flopping around all over the place. It was interesting. We all used to think it was really comical.JOHN:	How old were you around that time?JERRY GONZALEZ:	How old was I? I must have been, say, about six years old. Back in those days, there was no such thing as pre-K, or K, or anything like that. They had what they called chart and primer, which were your basic kindergarten learning. Then from there you went on to first grade, second grade, third grade, and normal-like. We attended school up till sixth grade, and then from there we could go to junior high, which was what you call middle school now. It was interesting. The fun part was, like in the area where I grew up, it was really mostly Hispanic, very few Anglos, or of any other Indian or negro or anything like that. The bad part about it was that kids can be pretty vicious whenever somebody from a different group would come in. They went through a lot of harassing and had to put up with a lot of it. Now you look at it, and I figured, we were all pretty bad in that sense. We never hurt anybody physically, but still, we were abusive I would say. It took awhile for a lot of us to outgrow and not be so biased. In fact, when I went to middle school was when I finally figured out we were all just guys growing up and some of my best friends turned out to be some of the Anglo kids that were there. Some of my friends held that against me because they thought that since we were Hispanic, Chicano, or whatever you want to call yourself, that we should always be together and just us. I thought, no man, this was more fun the other way. We learned a lot of things. How they celebrated [00:05:00] Christmas or some holidays or whatever they did. Some of the different foods that they had, I found it really good, man. Pretty cool.JOHN:	What did you do for fun?JERRY GONZALEZ:	For fun? In our younger days, when I was in grade school, I tell you, since we lived up in the rural area, and the Santa Fe River had water in those days, there was fish in the river, we use to fish. We even used to dam up the river and make a swimming pool out of it and that's where we had our fun really. Then, of course, we had to do a lot of gardening and stuff like that because most, everybody had fields where we planted for food and so forth. Later on, thanks to one of the great priest that I've ever met in my life, was Father Smith. I can't remember what part of New York he was in. He was Irish. Our church was really in hot cup, I don't know, up to the steeple, I guess. We were really paying the principal on the interest. When he came over, he started figuring out ways to make money. One of the things that he worked out while making money to pay the church up, to build us a gymnasium there. It was like a recreational hall for a lot of the kids from the area where we all used to go play basketball, roller skate, box if you wanted to. When we got a little older, in our teens, he would have dances for us. It was a lot of fun. Good, clean fun. We got to meet some of the other peoples from the community that we knew they were around, but we didn't know who they were, really. So it helped a lot into getting us all to know each other and learn from one another too. Another fun part that we use do, we always used to like to come down to the plaza in Santa Fe and that's where everybody prominated around and did all of their business, all of their marketing or whatever. That's where you found all the good or bad news, who had died, who was having a baby, who was getting married or whatever, who was in jail even or whatever.JOHN:	What were your parents like?JERRY GONZALEZ:	My parents were not highly educated or anything like that, but they did fairly well. My dad always had a job. We didn't have a lot of anything, but we had enough to eat always. My mom used to work also. Both of them, they provided very well for us, really. My mom, I swear that she must have been a magician to be able to fix meals like that. I don't know how she did that. But man, I tell you, the only time I went hungry was because of my choosing, really, for being some kind of an idiot at the time.JOHN:	What was the favorite thing she cooked for you?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I used to love everything. She was good at baking. She used to make the best pies, cakes, and stuff like that. Man, I tell you, when it came to sweet stuff, I was there.JOHN:	Definitely. Did you use to get into trouble a lot?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Somewhat.JOHN:	What was the worst thing you did?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Well, the worst thing I used to do is, I had a cousin that he wasn't too swift and I was pulling some prank on him or another, trying to chip him out of his money or whatever. Until my mom found out about it and that was the end of that. I'll tell you, I didn't sit down for a while. Then my dad came home and he had a go-at-it too. I tell you one thing, whenever they say, ""Wait till your father gets home,"" I still tremble. But growing up in our area it was fun. Living in the country, let me put it that way, we raised pigs, rabbits, chickens and so we were fortunate in a sense that we always had eggs and there was always some meat whenever we wanted; chicken, rabbit, or even sometimes we'd kill a kid goat and invite the neighbors and everybody, we'd have a big banquet out of it. By the time it was done, those kid goats didn't have much meat on them. All you found was a bunch of bones, really, and that was it. Let me tell you, my brother and I, I don't remember who, one of our uncles gave us each a rabbit and at the time both of us were fairly young. So we didn't know how those things multiply. So when the first birthing of the rabbits we had, we thought it was pretty cool and as they grew up, we started selling them to the neighborhood. Anybody who wanted to buy a rabbit or my dad would even dress them and everything and we just take it to them and sell it to for about, maybe, $0.50 I think, I can't remember. But then those suckers keep multiplying. I tell you, man. After a while, we were trying to give them away, nobody wanted them or anything. One advantage that I had, my brother [00:10:00] and I, when we were growing up, he was quite a few years older than me but we were always together. He always took care of me and I was always hanging around with him and his friends. Sometimes I learned a lot of things I shouldn't have learned from the older guys. But I remember the good times that I had with my brother because he was always there for me no matter what. Even now, he's the one that I communicate more than any of my younger brothers anyway.JOHN:	So would you say that he was your best friend, or did you have-JERRY GONZALEZ:	He was my best friend up till I got into my teens. Then we started clashing a lot. I blamed myself more. I thought I was a real, smart guy and he put me down a few times. But then, when the Korean conflict broke out, he was a member of the National Guard. They were called to active duty, and I was left at home. At that time, it was only me and my older sister that were at home, my other sister Francis had married, and then my younger brothers were there, but they were very young, so it was between me and Ernestine to help my mom with the housework or even the outside work and stuff like that. So a lot of the chores that Sam and I did, like chopping wood and getting water and so forth, that was all my responsibility now. Then I started thinking, ""Man, I couldn't realize how much I missed my older brother because I had do it all."" But when he came back on leave the first time, we've had both maybe matured in a sense. Because we missed each other so much, we started hanging around together again, and we did for many years, even as old as we were.JOHN:	What did you think your life would be like when you were younger?JERRY GONZALEZ:	You mean?JOHN:	When you got older?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Unfortunately, as far as I can remember, I don't think I had much thoughts about the future. I figured I would finally wind up working just like my dad, some kind of work like my father. First, he started out as the gardener or handyman for James L. Breese and his wife. But then, during World War 2, Breese invented this type of oil burner that was used in the service which burns underwater. They used to put them in garbage cans. That's what most of the soldiers used to clean up their mess kits and stuff like that. The place where he lived, they had some stables, and they got rid of most of the horses and turned the stables into a plant where they had an assembly line to fix all these burners and stuff like that. So that's where my dad worked in, so he had a fairly decent job. I figured eventually, I was going to wind up in the same place. My brother worked there too. Like I said, unfortunately, I wasn't planning on pursuing a higher education than 12th grade, so I knew I was going to have to find a job.JOHN:	Where did you end up working?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Well, my very first job, I worked for a very famous artists from Santa Fe who used to live up by the watershed close to us, and that was Randall Davey. He used to have these big patches of strawberries and raspberries, and we used to go and he'd give us little baskets and we'd pick the berries. Then he'd pay us according to how many berries we had picked. He'd give us a nickel, a dime, or something like that. Which to us, that meant we had movie, money, and probably even buy popcorn and a hotdog or whatever you like. Dime used to buy quite a bit at that time. Then later on, when I was in my teens, I worked for the Williams. He was a retired Major from the service. I took care of their garden, their lawns and stuff like that. Even in the wintertime, when it snowed, I'd go and clean the walks for him. Later on, when they sold out, the Watsons took over, and I worked for them also because they had recommended me to work for them. When I graduated from high school, I was out looking for work, and not too many companies would give you much of a break because none of us had too much of an experience in anything. But when Mrs. Watson found out that I had graduated and was looking for a job, she told me that the bank needed a parking lot attendant. I said, well, I figured it's better than nothing. So I applied for the job and wound up [00:15:00] instead of working in the parking lot, they put me to work in bookkeeping, which was a fun job because it was all a female bookkeeping place, and I was the only male there. It was pretty interesting. In fact, my immediate supervisor would tell me, because we used to have meetings at least once a month, staff meetings and he'd tell me, ""Jerry, get your harem together and take them down to the basement because we're going to have a meeting today,"" and I said okay.JOHN:	Overall, what did you do for a career?JERRY GONZALEZ:	For a career? I had figured I just stick to banking, really. But then, as time went by, I took some courses through the bank, but I figured eventually, I was going to need a certificate. I was going to have to either attend the college somehow or another, and I couldn't afford it. So then, this friend of mine kept telling me to take the exam to be a letter carrier with the Postal Service. Finally, he got me the application, signed that. He'd send that in and everything, and I took the exam and passed it, and eventually, got hired. That's what I did for 29 years, and I enjoyed it very much. Let me tell you, that was one of the best things I could have ever done.JOHN:	Why is that?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I like the work. I like talking to people and just being out in the open. Sometimes, it was pretty hot in the summer, and even that didn't bother me. The cold in winter and I'd get wet and everything, but I don't know, I just enjoyed it and it was fun dealing with all the different kinds of people in Santa Fe. I got to know Santa Fe better than I had ever thought I could know it.JOHN:	Is there a difference between mailman then and mailman now?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Not really, except I tell you, I think we had more pride then when I joined. Nice guys are all dead. To me, by the time I left, I figured we're getting a bunch of whiner. Don't ever tell that to the other guys, but that's the way I felt. Then after I left the post office and retired, then I got another big break because when Stephen Pfeffer, the judge in Santa Fe was running, I helped him on his campaign. We lost, but then he got appointed when one of the other judges got killed in an accident. He called me, and I became a bailee for him, which at the time I knew nothing about the judicial system. That was a real eye-opener on what happens in courts and stuff like that. I was very fortunate to work with Judge Pfeffer because he was patient enough to explain a lot of things to me that I didn't understand, plus even how the law reads or so forth because sometimes, he'd ask me, ""How do you think I did on this hearing?"" Especially, when he'd settler a civil case, or even when we went into criminal. A lot of times, I gave him my opinion. He told me, ""Well, wait a minute."" He said, ""Let me explain to you how the law reads."" Then when he explained that to me, then I found out, ""Wait a minute, now I understand why you went the way you did."" I'll tell you, I learned a lot from him, not only about the judicial system, but he's a pretty traveled man and very learned, really. He's very educated. Some of the stories and things that he told me, they really made a big impact on me and my life, to be truthful with you.JOHN:	Well, what kind of things did you learn from him?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I will tell you one thing: He was a Jewish. He's not a practicing Jew, but he explained to me a lot of their religion and stuff like that, and we used to compare from Catholic to Jewish, which there's a lot of similarities too, but there was a lot of things that they don't follow that we do. Then another thing, from some of the travels that he's done and stuff like that, he would explain to me how some people lived or how they survived, more or less. That was very interesting, really, how he told me. Another thing that I learned from him is that, he said you can't change the world. You just got to roll with the punches with it and hopefully, somehow, you can make some kind of indentation in whatever is going on, and maybe things will change for the better for somebody. Actually, when I went to work with him, it was a little after your grandma Arlene had died, and I needed some guidance really bad at that time. I think I was very fortunate to land [00:20:00] that job with him, really.JOHN:	Well, do you believe in an afterlife?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Yes, I do, very much so. We have always been thought that, but I've never changed my mind about that. The funny part about it, the only thing is, when your grandma Arlene died, I, not really drifted away from my beliefs, but somewhat. Then eventually, talking to the judge and then I've met a nun one time who had some doctorate. She explained to me a lot of things. Well, I figured I was doing wrong, and she explained to me and told me, ""No, you're being normal, really. It was just something that anybody who had suffered to the same trauma would go through."" Not everybody, but some people do. In my case, she told me that was it.JOHN:	Well, what things did you feel?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I felt like there was no God, really, for a while there because I'd say to myself, ""Why me? I've been going to church, I've been praying. I've been doing all the things that I thought that my religion required of me,"" and yet this loss really devastated me a lot. Then when I went to work with the judge, he explained to me a lot of things, how the Jewish feel about it. For one thing, they don't believe in hell, which is one of the things that we used to kid each other about, because I'd tell him, ""I want to see you down there."" He said, ""No way, Tommy. We don't believe in that, so we're not going there."" But there was a lot of things that him and I, some of the conversations we had. One of the stories that he told me was when he got tired of going to law school, which he was attending in Denver, and he just figured he had enough of it and he took off. He went with two other guys in one of those, what do you call it, Volkswagen buses. They traveled all the way to Alaska. The way they used to make money was they had learned to make coyote fences. That's what they used to do in order to keep going, make money for gas, food and so forth. Then he said, ""One time I was freezing my como se llama up there in Alaska."" He said, ""We had two fires and I'd be standing facing one and the other one was behind us so we could keep our backside warm."" He thought, ""There's got to be a better thing. I'm going back to school."" He told them and that's what he did. It was fun. I really enjoyed working with him. I don't know. To me it was a godsend and set me in the right state of mind, really, and got me back into joining the human race again.JOHN:	Well, if you'd give me advice or advice to me or my children, what would you say?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Right now, I'll tell you what, get as much education as you can. Find your goal and pursue it and work at it and don't let anything deter you from it at all. Just set your aim straight and go for what you want. Do what you want to be, but also, here's the thing, make sure that it's something that you really like and you're going to enjoy doing. Because if you're going to be doing eight hours of something, five days a week or whatever, you have to enjoy it too. Sure, you could be making lots of money, but money brings you some happiness, but even in work or even in marriage, money isn't everything. It's you, what you really want to do and what you can enjoy. I'll tell you one thing. I enjoyed banking, but when I went to work for the post office, I thought I had landed in heaven at that time. The guys I worked with were a bunch of crazies, really. We had fun, but we did the job and we enjoyed it. We had the pride when we came back from our route. We felt good. We gave it our all and we did a good job. At Christmas time, we delivered gifts to different people, specially some of these little kids that figured that grandma or maybe their parents had forgotten all about it. You knock on their door and you bring in this big old box and set them there under their tree and you see there eyes light up. That was one hell of a reward, I'll tell you.JOHN:	Definitely. How do you want to be remembered?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I'd just like to be remembered the way I've been. In fact, a lot of people used to say that. Some of the women used tell me that they didn't even think I was married because I was always real happy-go-lucky. That's the way I've always been. I like to treat people right, no matter what. One advice I'll give you also, [00:25:00] never go by the first opinion you have of somebody. Because I found out the hard way that sometimes somebody that I figured, my God, I can't stand this guy, turned out to be one of my best friends in the long run. From now on, I try not to judge a book by its cover. I try to give him a chance to work with me and I work with him and find out who he really is and what he's like and so forth. I just like to be remembered the way I've always been. Most of my friends and the people that I worked with in that, they know me just the way I was. Most of the people I worked when I was doing juries, they always tell me we'll always remember you because you were always happy. Even though we had a big criminal case to do, a murder trial or something. I always used to come in, ""Okay. Good morning, boys and girls. Get ready, we're going to be going in in a few minutes."" I try to explain and I joke with them a little bit, put them at ease. One of the retired judges saw how I was doing things and he came up to me. You know what he said? ""You are doing one heck of a job. You're not following protocol,"" he told me. But here's the thing, he told me, ""You put those people at ease and when by the time they're getting to the jury, they're ready to tackle the job, aren't they?"" I said, ""Well, I hope so."" I said, ""I don't want to spend the whole week on this case.""JOHN:	What helped you to bring forth this optimism to your everyday life?JERRY GONZALEZ:	It was just natural for me because I've always been like that. Even as a little kid, my mother used to say that. My mother, Elena, was always telling me that, if it was rainy, I didn't care. If it was sunny, fine. She used to call me that I was her nature boy. We used to call another guy, an old man who was we used to call him Nature Book because he was one of these guys that would go out in his all togetherness and just scare the people or whatever. I told her, ""No, mama. I'm not a nature boy."" ""No,"" she said, ""I don't mean that kind of nature boy."" My brother and I, wherever we went, we used to go to parties, we used to like to sing and just have a good time and dance. I don't know, that the way we've always been.JOHN:	What's one of your favorite memories with your brother?JERRY GONZALEZ:	My favorite memories are him and I just going downtown and dancing up a storm in one of the dances and coming home and having a good time. Or even just what we used to do two bunch of us guys, mostly his friends because I was way younger. They'd all get together and plan a picnic and we'd all go to Hyde Park, spend the whole Sunday afternoon out there playing ball. There was always some women folk around. We all used to have a good time. Somebody would take a guitar and we just start singing away, enjoying life, communing with nature in our way.JOHN:	Do you still play the guitar?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I do a little bit. I haven't been really doing it as much as I'd like to because, my fingers, because of the arthritis, they don't work that good. But, every so often, I pick it up. In fact, the other day, Destiny got all surprised because I picked it up and started playing and singing. She told me, ""You can still play?"" I said, ""Yeah. I think so.""JOHN:	How long had you been playing for? When did you start?JERRY GONZALEZ:	See, I started in my later life. Well, I started when I was in grade school. I tried to start. I took lessons because we had somebody give lessons there, but this guy was real sarcastic. Finally, I figured, no, I'm not learning anything from this guy. I quit. But then my brother, David, he knew I always used to sing and stuff like that, so when they were playing, wherever they were playing, he'd tell me, ""Come on. You want to sing us something?"" I said, ""Sure. Why not."" Then he finally told, ""You got to learn to play a guitar."" He told me, ""Come on, man. That way you can come and help us and so forth,"" I figured, no, I can't do it. I tell him, ""You guys can play, I can't."" But, for one of my birthdays, your Grandma Arlene gave me a party and he gave me a card. He told me, ""I owe you X amount of guitar lessons."" So he told your Grandma Arlene to buy me a guitar. In fact, he loaned me one of his and I started taking lessons. I started liking it and felt that I could do it. I'm not as good as he, he does much better, both him and Lorenzo, but I figured I could do it. That's how I got started on it. I must have been in my, I'd say, around 40s, at least. But it's been fun. Sometimes, when I feel a little blue or something, I just [00:30:00] mess with the guitar for a little bit. The music soothes and, before I know it, I forget what the heck I thought was so bad, really. It helps.JOHN:	Do you regret anything?JERRY GONZALEZ:	There's some things that I regret. The one thing is sometimes I feel I wasn't around enough for my children when they were growing up. Because, when I went to work for the post office, it wasn't an 8:00 to 5:00 for one thing because we never knew how long our routes we're going to take us. We used to work late. In fact, when I started there, I was putting in about 14 hours a day.JOHN:	Damn.JERRY GONZALEZ:	By the time I came home, I was beat. Later on, when I got to be a regular, that my time schedule was a little better, but then my mistake was sometimes, after work, a lot of us guys we say let's go have a couple of brews. By the time I got home, it was pretty late. That I regret, I really do. I wish a lot of things that I had done differently, that in particular.JOHN:	Well, do you any last wishes?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Just, hopefully, that when I partake from this world, that people will still remember me and just remember the good things. I'm sure there are some things that they are going to remember of me that aren't too good, but I hope the good part of me shows up more than the bad.MALE_1:	I do have a quick question, if that's okay.JOHN:	Shoot.MALE_1:	You talked a lot about a lot of people who influenced you, but who do you think the biggest influence has been in your life?JERRY GONZALEZ:	The biggest influence in my life, I would say, would be my brother and the judge, really. Those were the two people that I really feel that really made a good influence in me. I learned a lot of bad things for my brother, don't get me wrong, but in the long run, he would always set me straight and tell me this is not the way to go. Even when we were older, because he would tell me, ""No. You're wrong."" He'd tell me, ""Don't do it."" A lot of times, I'd say my brother, really, my brother Sam.MALE_1:	What is your brother's full name?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Samuel.MALE_1:	The last name as well.JERRY GONZALEZ:	His name is Samuel Marcos Gonzales. Actually, Marcos is for our father's name. He was supposed to be Junior, but we never call him Junior. He was always Sam.MALE_1:	What is the judge's full name?JERRY GONZALEZ:	That was Stephen Pfeffer. But he had a big influence on me, also,I got to admit. I had met a lot of people. I don't know. He's got a way of telling things, and even just as a storyteller, he's good. I'll tell you, he's really good.JOHN:	So how did you feel about retirement?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Retirement? Well, that's what you're thinking of every time from the day you started working and you figure, someday, I want to retire, take it easy, go fishing or whatever. But retirement isn't actually all that it's made out to be. I don't know.JOHN:	Why not?JERRY GONZALEZ:	Well, I'll tell you one thing. I didn't have very bad life. I have very few hobbies, really. Play the guitar, fishing, and hunting has never been my game. But I guess when you've been working all your life and you retired in your home, it's difficult to just relax and take it easy. Sometimes, you feel like you're in the way in a way. That's why I was glad that I was able to pick up on another job. It took a while, but like I say, it was a godsend for me. Another thing, now that I'm retired again, in fact, I was even trying to go do a bailiff job again, but unfortunately, they had already filled the position when I applied for it. Although they told me, ""Well, if any breaks come along, we'll call you back."" I felt like being a bailiff, I accomplish something that I never thought I could. The law was never in my books. My life had always been one foot over the line and one step ahead of the law. Never did anything really bad, but still, some things were not what the cops would say was good. But I learned a lot and I found out that I got along with all of those guys who were mostly retired policemen and stuff like that. We all had a lot in common, [00:35:00] that's what I found out. The one thing that I enjoy the most is when I left, they told me, ""You know what, we're going to miss you.""MALE_1:	I do have one quick question, if that's okay?JOHN:	Yeah.MALE_1:	It's about the judge. How did you first meet him?JERRY GONZALEZ:	How I met him was when he was running for the judgeship. My daughter used to work for, what do you call it, parole and probation? The guy that was his manager or treasurer, I can't remember, was a good friend of my daughter. He was a parole officer, and he talked my daughter into helping them campaign for the judge. So one morning, my daughter, Laura, called me and told me, ""Dad, we're going to be canvassing in your area. Can we stop by and have you meet the judge?"". I said, ""Yeah, sure. Bring him around."" He stopped by and we talked, which is just a little bit. I wished him well in his campaign, and then he just out of the clear blue sky he asked me, ""Would you be willing to help me in my campaign?"". I figured I wasn't doing anything, why not? It would give me something to do. Plus, I figured they have rallies, they have booze, they have food. It would be a nice change anyway. I didn't really get to know him that well because we were all busy, but I like how he handled himself and I like what he had to say. When he finally got the appointment, the bailiff that he had decided to go work for another judge who was going back on the bench and left him high and dry reeling. So he was trying to figure out who to call to be his bailiff. His wife remembered me that I was retired and she told him, ""Why don't you call that little guy that helped you on the campaign?"". So he figured, ""Well, I tell you we're scraping the bottom of the barrel, right?"", I said okay. He said, ""That was the best thing I ever did,"" he told me, ""because you and I,"" he said, ""we worked together."" It was strange when I first went to work. I was going to work a couple of months and quit because I figured, no, this is not for me. After the first three weeks, I figured, no man, this is the best thing that ever happened to me. The secretary and I, we used to get along right off the bat. The three of us, we were a team. Everything started falling into place, and it was good. It was a good feeling. They helped me a lot and I did whatever I had to do. I don't regret it at all, man, I'll tell you. I think that one of the best things that happened to me, brought me from my own floundering world that I was in, and put me back in reality, and really set me straight again.JOHN:	Do you think it's the job that help with that or was it the people as well?JERRY GONZALEZ:	The people as well as the work, really. I'll tell you one thing. When I saw some of the cases that we were doing and I figured some of them, a lot of these DWIs and stuff like that, I figured, God, man. Therefore, if it weren't for God, it could go awry. I see the error of my ways too. I felt sorry for the guys there for whatever they were in for, but I was thankful that it wasn't me standing in front of the judge. One time I told him, ""You know what? I don't know, it could have happened that I would have been standing."" ""We would have met the other way,"" he told me. ""No,"" I said, ""I don't ever want to see you in front of my bench."" ""You won't,"" I told him. But it was really a great experience. Most of the jobs that I've had, I've learned a lot from them somehow. If nothing else, I think I've learned how to deal with life, really.JOHN:	How's that?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I don't know. In the mail service, you walk into the post office and you see this pile of mail, you figure, oh, God, I'll never be able to clean this place up. You work at it, and you work at it, and then you go and hit the street, and you start talking to people, and delivering your mail, and you figured all of a sudden, it's not such a bad day after all. It could be raining or snowing, but heck, it was nice being out there. I really loved it, man.JOHN:	Is that why you know all of Santa Fe?JERRY GONZALEZ:	I would say yes. Then a lot of people would laugh at me because they tell me, ""You're always sinking,"" and that I don't want that bitch talking to myself. As you see, that looks so bad. [00:40:00] Yeah mijito, whatever you do, choose a good profession and one that you can enjoy. That will make you happy too that you'll be happy doing what you're doing.JOHN:	Definitely. Well, anything else that I can take away from this from you?JERRY GONZALEZ:	No, I think we've covered it pretty well. I'm happy that I found a good woman after my first one. My wife died and Melody's been there for me, and that helped a lot, and all these things clicked up at the same time. When I went to work for the judge, I met her, and we married, and did that. That also I think is the one thing that kept me figuring that hey, it's time to look for a better world.JOHN:	Definitely. Well, thanks for coming out today.JERRY GONZALEZ:	I appreciate it. In fact, I'm glad you asked me to do this, really. It's been a good experience too, I think.JOHN:	Definitely. My pleasure.JERRY GONZALEZ:	Well, me too, mijito. Tell you one thing, I'm glad you did. I was a little nervous this week. But slowly but surely, I figured, heck, nothing can go wrong.",1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
MBY006558,"Alan Mendoza:	[00:00:00] My name is Alan Mendoza, I'm 37 years old. Today's date is May 28th of 2010. We are in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am the son of Gloria Mendoza.Gloria Mendoza:	My name is Gloria Mendoza, I'm 63 years old. Today's date is May 28th, 2010. We're in a trailer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm here with my oldest son, Alan Mendoza.Alan Mendoza:	Well, this is a great opportunity to talk to my mom, and I'm here now for an interview, but just to have a conversation with my mom about her life and how wonderful it has been this far. So I'm going to have some questions, and we're going to talk about a lot of things. But first of all, I'd like to ask you your full name again.Gloria Mendoza:	My name is Gloria Bertha Mendoza. My maiden name was Romero.Alan Mendoza:	Tell me a little bit about your name, mom. Did anybody ever tell you, grandma or grandpa, who you were named after, possibly? Where they came up with your name specifically?Gloria Mendoza:	Well, specifically, the way they used to do it when I was young, my mother told me that the padrinos that were baptizing you are the ones that pick the name. So my padrino Joe, and my madrina Nea named me Gloria Bertha, of which. I guess it's all right.Alan Mendoza:	Throughout these years, have you gone by any nicknames? What do your kids call you, your friends? Do you have any nicknames that you go by?Gloria Mendoza:	No, I don't have any nicknames. The only thing is is that my kids always called me mom, except when I wouldn't listen to them or I ignore them, then they'd call me Gloria.Alan Mendoza:	Or Glor, I think I remember calling you Glor. What about when you were in high school? Did you have any nicknames with your friends?Gloria Mendoza:	Some people used to call me Glory Be.Alan Mendoza:	Glory Be. Do you know where that came from?Gloria Mendoza:	I think it came from church because I used to go to church every Sunday then.Alan Mendoza:	So tell us a little bit about where you were born and where you grew up. Let's start with where you were born.Gloria Mendoza:	I was born in Santa Fe, and I wasn't like other normal kids that was born in a hospital. I was born at home, and that was at 1504 Hickcox Street in Santa Fe. I've always been there, and always will be there, I was born there, I'll probably die there.Alan Mendoza:	Can you tell me, who are your parents?Gloria Mendoza:	My father was Manuel Baudino Romero, and he was from La Cienega. His father was Fecundo Romero, and his mother was Doña Aurora Narvaez and she was from La Bonanza, which is a piece of land. It was part of the Juanita. Let me see, the land grant. I can't remember it right off. I know it all the time. I just can't think of it right now.Alan Mendoza:	I think I've heard you talk about them before.Gloria Mendoza:	La Mesita Juana Lopez Land Grant.Alan Mendoza:	Land grant? What did grandpa or your dad do for a living? Did he grew up there also in Santa Fe?Gloria Mendoza:	My dad grew up in La Cienega, he was one of 13 children of Aurora and Fecundo. My grandfather Fecundo and his son Pedro went out to pick piñon one time up in La Mesa in Cienega , and a big blizzard, a snow blizzard hit and they have gotten with a lot of men, with other friends to go pick piñon, and they got caught in the blizzard, lost their direction, and they froze to death up in La Mesa. So then my grandmother, at that time, a little after that, I think she couldn't accept the death of my grandfather so she left the family. [00:05:00] My father at that time had joined the service during World War II. When the children were left alone, they brought my father back from the army so that he could raise his brothers and sisters. He raised them.Alan Mendoza:	On his own?Gloria Mendoza:	On his own. Yet, many years later, after all of them were married and everything, my grandma, Doña Aurora, she married her brother-in-law who had a daughter, and he was a widower, and she came back to the family and never did anyone say, ""Don't come into my home."" They welcomed her with open arms because that was their mother.Alan Mendoza:	Tell me a little bit about your mom's family. Who was your mom?Gloria Mendoza:	My mom was Lydia Luisa Romero. My maternal grandparents, her father was Theodore Romero, and her mother was Luisa, and her maiden name was Montoya. She was related to Senator Montoya's family, those Montoyas. I didn't really know a lot about my mother's parents, and one of her sisters were left orphans when they were nine years old. My mother didn't like talking about my grandfather. She remembered my grandmother very little, because she was so young when she passed away. But she didn't like talking about her father, and I asked her one time why she didn't never talked about my grandpa. She told me because he was mean, he was an abuser and he was an alcoholic. So every time that I asked her about him, she would start crying and didn't want to talk about him. I'm sure they went through some hard times with him. From what I understand, he was a miner, he used to work the mines out by Solidos in Madrid. He used to go walking with all his kids, and they used to live in a cave while he was working. Then when the season was over, they would walk back all the way to Santa Fe.Alan Mendoza:	Do you remember what mines those were? Were they in Santa Fe?Gloria Mendoza:	Well, they were in Solidos or Madrid. I don't know. One of those there. I never really got exactly where he worked at, but he did work the mines. But my aunts always said that he was very mean. All my uncles had blue eyes, and I asked my mother why they had blue eyes, she said she didn't know. But my aunt, the eldest of the girls, I talked to her and she told me that my grandfather on my mother's side was adopted. That he was adopted by some people out in the Las Vegas, New Mexico area, and that he was German, that he was brought in with his parents. They came to visit and the parents went back to Germany and they left him there with this Romero family. So he grew up as a Romero. He was left there as a very, very young child. I think that's why my mother's side of the family, they all have blue eyes and they were all blondes.Alan Mendoza:	You mentioned your mom's sister and the fact that they had been left orphan. That's who we know as nanny, right?Gloria Mendoza:	Yes.Alan Mendoza:	Tell us who nanny is?Gloria Mendoza:	My mother and nanny, nanny was her sister. They were left orphans, they were the only ones left with the grandfather. When they were left orphan, none of the brothers and sisters offered to take them in, so they stayed at the house where they were born. Basically, my mom's sister quit school and went to work, and she was probably only about 11, 12 years old. Went to work and supported herself and my mom. So they had a bond that was unbelievable because one couldn't do without the other. All their lives up to the time that my mother [00:10:00] passed on.Alan Mendoza:	Whose nanny?Gloria Mendoza:	Her name is Juana Lupita, and we call her Pita. She was Romero. She married Paul Ortega. After my mother passed away, and my mother was only 44 years old when she passed away, I was only 21, nanny or Pita took over as our mom. She helped us clean my dad's house, she taught us a lot of things, she taught us how to survive without my mom. I don't know what I would do if I ever lost her.Alan Mendoza:	We talked a little bit about your mom and your dad. Real quick, if you can tell me one of your fondest memories about your dad.Gloria Mendoza:	The fondest memory I have is when we used to go down to La Cienega. He owned a piece of property and that was called El Ancón. My fondest memory was when we were turning the dirt over and planting, we planted almost a whole acre of vegetables. There was a little creek that run right next to our property and when we finished irrigating or we finished cutting weeds, or we finished picking up our crops, my brother, Richard would go and make a dam in the creek, and we would jump in there and just cool off. The only thing I remember about my mother at that time is, we have this big alamo and which they also used as a matanza. That alamo, my mom would be sitting under it. My mother was more of a fragile woman and she would watch us help my dad. She was ill a lot of the time and she would be there making sandwiches. She takes some chorizo. I'll never forget that. You can hardly find it in the stores anymore. But it's that round chorizo that has a red skin around it. She would do that and make us sandwiches with that. She'd make us Kool-Aid. Dad would give her, maybe, a cantaloupe or a watermelon off the land there. We would just grab those carrots right off the ground and rinse them with the water that we were irrigating with and just eat them from there. There's no taste better than that. I don't care where you buy your vegetables. There's nothing like pulling it off the ground and just eating it from there.Alan Mendoza:	Tell us a little bit about your brothers and sisters. How many brothers and sisters did you have? Tell us a little bit about who they were.Gloria Mendoza:	My oldest brother was Richard Formato, and then it was me. There were two children in between, my brother Richard and myself, two boys, and they were named Sammy and Danny. They died at a young age. They died like probably within the first year, year-and-a-half.Alan Mendoza:	Do you remember what the what's wrong?Gloria Mendoza:	They died of pneumonia, both of them. Then seven years later comes my brother, Donald, after myself, and then my sister Geneva, and then my younger brother, Arthur. We called him Toodi and we call Geneva Nini, and we call Donald, Donny. Everybody had their own little nicknames.Alan Mendoza:	Where did you go? You grew up on Hickcox Street in grandpa's house out there.Gloria Mendoza:	Yes.Alan Mendoza:	Where did you go to elementary school?Gloria Mendoza:	Well, elementary school, I started at [inaudible 00:14:41] Catholic School. Then I got spanked in the third grade with a paddle and I cried. I never wanted to go back to that school again. Because I shouldn't have gotten paddled. It was somebody else that was talking, not me. Of course, we always say that.Alan Mendoza:	I've heard that before. [00:15:00] My daughter always tells me that.Gloria Mendoza:	So I never wanted to go back to Catholic school. I cried and cried until my mom and dad gave in and they sent me to all board elementary. Talk about a wake-up call, man. I had pigtails and I had girls with knives, grabbing my pigtails and telling me that if I didn't take them a sheet of paper and a pencil every day that they were going to cut my pigtails off. It's kind of scary.Alan Mendoza:	Yeah.Gloria Mendoza:	Especially going from my Catholic school where you were praying and you had to be nice to each other, going to a public school where they were pulling out knives on you. I'll never forget that lady, her name, that girl that used to do that to me. Her name was Lula Crane. I'll never forget her name. I swore to myself that I never forget.Alan Mendoza:	When you were kids, what kind of games and stuff did you guys play or how did you entertain yourself on Hickox?Gloria Mendoza:	Oh my god, we had so much to entertain. I had an uncle. Well, most of the family, we lived around in the same neighborhood because my grandfather had owned all that land, almost a whole block. So I had uncles and aunts that lived around us. My grandmother lived two streets away. My aunt that was my mother's best friend, my [inaudible 00:16:25] . She lived about two blocks away from us. So it was all family. It was wonderful because all the cousins plus other neighbors, other kids that lived in the neighborhood, we would get together every day, especially in the summer, in the evening, in this empty lot and we will play. We'd start nice, we start playing nice games like baseball, and then it starts getting a little dark and we started playing kick the can.Alan Mendoza:	I remember that game.Gloria Mendoza:	Then we had this one that, I don't know who made this one up. But I think it was my tia Frances. She was really a, she looked Indian or she dressed like Indian. She still wore the long skirts and had the two braids and very quiet. Never went to visit anybody, nothing. But you always saw her peeking out her window. Her window faced the street. So you always knew if anything was going on in the neighborhood, my tia Frances would know. Because she knew everything that was going on. All she did was look out the window. She never came out. Only at night, she would come up to her porch and then she would tell us spooky stories. Then she made up this game where it was called La Vaqueta Caliente. It was a belt and you would put it in a circle around on the ground. It was like hide and seek. Everybody would go hide and it was at night where you couldn't see them. As soon as you found somebody, you could run over there and grab the belt and start whipping at them, start hitting them with it. I never liked that game because anytime my brother found that belt, he would chase me all the way from my tia Frances' house, all the way to my house until I was inside the house and then I would ever go out again.Alan Mendoza:	The game was over.Gloria Mendoza:	For me it was. Not for him and anybody else.Alan Mendoza:	What about when you grew up and you went to high school? Where did you go to high school? Tell us a little bit about your high school years.Gloria Mendoza:	Well, I went to BF Young Junior High. It was a rough school, but I knew everybody there. Everybody in the neighborhood went to school there. Then from there I went to Santa Fe High School. At that time, Santa Fe High School was going through some major changes. We only had half-day school. I've always wondered why the public schools don't come up with that now, because I went to school just half days. I would go in the morning session. We would go in the morning and then we were out by noontime, and we still graduated. We still got all our credits. But our education was mostly the basic educations. They didn't have all this artsy-fartsy stuff and all this extra stuff that they give the kids that they have now. It was all basics. You had your reading, and math, and biology, and history, and you got maybe one elective. Of course, it was pretty nice. It worked. Half of the kids [00:20:00] in high school would go in the morning, half would go in the afternoon.Alan Mendoza:	What would you do for the rest of your day when you get home, or when you got out of school?Gloria Mendoza:	When I got home, all I did was clean house and help my mom around the house. Once I got of age though, I started working. I would work that half-day into the evening.Alan Mendoza:	What was your first job at? Do you remember?Gloria Mendoza:	The first first job that I ever really had was at Zook's Pharmacy. It's where Haagen-Dazs is at now.Alan Mendoza:	On the plaza?Gloria Mendoza:	On the plaza. It was like a soda fountain. People would come in, they'd order sandwiches, or things to drink. That was my first job. My best job I ever had, and it was  $1.85 an hour, was at La Fonda. I was a maid.Alan Mendoza:	At La Fonda?Gloria Mendoza:	At La Fonda.Alan Mendoza:	Who else worked at La Fonda? I remember you mentioned somebody else.Gloria Mendoza:	My Aunt Josephine, that was my dad's sister. She's the one that got me in there. We had a blast over there. It was really nice. I really enjoyed it. I was getting paid more than my friends were. I was getting $1.85 an hour at that time. My Aunt Josephine and I would buddy up because we used to have to clean 21 rooms in one day. So we would get together as partners and help each other out so that we could finish earlier. When we finished early, we'd go to a checkout room and just sit there and smoke, her and I.Alan Mendoza:	Do you remember what you did with your money? When you save your money back then? Do you remember?Gloria Mendoza:	My mother opened me an account at Sweet Briars.Alan Mendoza:	Was that a bank?Gloria Mendoza:	It was all about clothes. Heck no. I am a girl. I want clothes. I want shoes. I want whatever's in. I had my own little account there. One thing that I always did, no matter what, I always gave one third of my check to my parents. They didn't want it, but I wanted them to have it. It made me feel that I was learning how to be on my own because someday I knew that I would have to be paying somebody.Alan Mendoza:	Plus it made you feel like you were contributing to the family too.Gloria Mendoza:	Of course. My dad was the only one that worked. My mother never worked. My father was a gas pipe fitter for the gas company in New Mexico. That's where he retired from. My mother was always there. She was the one that had us doing our homework, our chores. Nowadays I wish people could afford for mothers to stay home because there's nothing more safe and more, how can I say?Alan Mendoza:	Nourishing.Gloria Mendoza:	Nourishing to a child than to be able to come home, open the door, and your mother's there, and not have to go to daycare, and not have to walk into a house with nobody there. I wish every mother could do that now, which I know is almost impossible.Alan Mendoza:	Can you name a few of your friends that you remember from high school?Gloria Mendoza:	I remember a lot of my friends,.Alan Mendoza:	Just maybe your five closest friends.Gloria Mendoza:	My five closest friends? Well, Patsy, Alarid, and she's Klein Schmidt now. She was my best friend. Gloria Espinosa was my best friend. Laurie Barels, but Laurie was Kintana at that time. She was a transfer from Loretto. The girls from Loretto they always thought they were better than us because it was like a private school. They used to come into the plaza, and they'd go into one of the stores down there, and they would go roll up their skirts to make them shorter because they used to have to wear long skirts. The in-thing was to wear skirts above your knee. So they would go into the stores and roll them up. We used to tease them. We used to call them names because they'd do that. But Laurie transferred over from Loretto Academy. Those were about my only really really best friends. There was Mary Lopez. She was [00:25:00] a very good friend of mine. Bernice Womack, Reyes Garcia. She's Aragon now. Bernice Womack is Valencia now. I guess that was it. I wasn't really close friends with my cousins that lived all around the neighborhood, but we used to see each other sometimes. I don't know. There was something that kept the brothers and sisters away from each other on my mother's family. I don't know if it's because of the life they had. I know Maitio Mare that was married to that lady that had the braids, Matia Frances. He lived right across the street from us and he had a chicken coop, a bunch of chickens. Every Saturday morning I would run over there because I knew he was going to be butchering the chickens. He had a block of wood, and he would get them, and he would cut their heads off. Then he would throw them at us, and they would jump around all over the dirt and we'd go around screaming like little girls do. Then he'd cut off the legs and give us the legs to play with. He'd have us pull the tendon of a leg and then we would run after each other. There was Matia Frances, on the little steps right in front of the kitchen door with a bucket of hot water, and dipping the chicken in, and plucking the feathers right off. He would always give me a chicken to take home to my mom every Saturday. But they weren't the family that used to visit each other every day. Only if they needed each other would they ever go visit each other.Alan Mendoza:	Do you remember anything in high school as far as fads? We talked about rolling up your skirts. What was the in-thing back then? The fads, or the cool things to do?Gloria Mendoza:	The coolest thing to do in Santa Fe, when I was growing up in high school, was cruise around Ingram's, cruise around the A&W, then go back into Santa Fe, into the plaza, cruise around the plaza, go back down to Ingram's again, go down to the A&W again. That's all we did. We were just going around in circles. We didn't have the opportunity, like in the winter, I remember I worked for the public schools and they asked me if I ever belong to the ski club, and I said, ""You're joking, right?"" In my day, when I was in school, the only ones that got to be in the ski club, and then the debate teams, and got to be in any of the clubs in school were the Anglos. For some reason or other, I don't know if it was our own fault, or if it was the fault of the people who put these clubs together, but the only ski club I knew was when it would snow real bad, we would stand at the corner on [inaudible 00:28:18] and we'd grab a bumper of a car, and we'd go skiing there. We used to hit the cover of the source, and we would wipe out, and then we'd go back to the corner and start holding onto cars. That was our ski club. The in-things, I remember the clothes. We used to use hiphuggers. Of course, we couldn't use them to school, but that was hiphuggers when you were hanging out, away from school. Used to wear tight skirts. Used to wear sweaters with the buttons to the back. Used to wear shifts, which was just a dress straight down. Real pointed shoes. Flats. That was the style.Alan Mendoza:	Back then.Gloria Mendoza:	The guys wore pants down to the hip with real thin belts. I went out with a guy like that. My dad told me I don't want you going out with him anymore. I said, ""Why?"" He was like, ""He's a Pachuco."" If you dress that way, you were considered a Pachuco. But he wasn't Pachuco. But my dad thought he was.Alan Mendoza:	Was your dad pretty strict with you in high school?Gloria Mendoza:	Very. He was very strict with me. One time I came in late and he beat me up in front of the boy right there in the porch. I was never so embarrassed in my life. But in our house, it was about [00:30:00] respect, and it was about following rules. I mean, if you broke a rule like that time I broke a rule and he just started beating on me in front of the boy on the porch. I couldn't ever face that guy after that. I see him around every once in a while and I still put my eyes down.Alan Mendoza:	Okay. Time's going by pretty fast, but tell me a little bit about your family now. Who you're married to? What your family is like now?Gloria Mendoza:	I'm married. I got married in 1967 in October 27th. I got married to Samuel Mendoza. As a matter of fact, his mom and my mom went to school together when they were in the eighth grade and they knew each other. But anyway, he went to school with me, but I never knew him until after we graduated. I told him, I said, ""Well, I guess because you didn't have any money and because you are a schedule song"". But I tease him, he's good-looking. I got married to him. We had four children, and our firstborn was Marcia Risa Mendoza. Then I had, of course, you Adan, no, wait a minute, your first name is Samuel Alan Mendoza. Then we had Emiliano Jesus Mendoza, and then we had Julio Simon Mendoza. I have seven grandchildren and I have two great grandchildren presently and one on the way. My son, Alan Mendoza, which is you. I just want to tell you how proud I am of you and how you make me feel that everything your dad and I worked for was worth it. We were poor. I used to go shopping for you guys at the Goodwill because we had one thing in mind. We lived in Sinaia, your dad and I without electricity, without plumbing. You remember those days? We lived like that from 1968 to 1980 because we wanted to save up money for him to become a contractor. So we lived very poor. We ate poorly, we dressed poorly, and not because we couldn't have gotten better things. We could have but it was because we had a goal for each one of our children. Of course, Adan, you know yourself, you've done so well. You've got a degree. You're now going to become a lieutenant with Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department. I see nothing but a brighter future for you. Then I have my daughter Marcia. She's really an accountant and she is a manager at Big Lots in Santa Fe, and she has five children. She's given me five beautiful grandchildren, and she's a grandma herself. Then I have Emiliano Mendoza. Emiliano, his career was in banking and he believed that he wanted to start another career and with better benefits and everything else. So he's now working for Santa Fe County. Then I have my poor Julio. Julio is the youngest of them all and he's still a lost child. He still hasn't been able to find himself, but he does have a journeyman electrician and I hope someday that he can put it to good use and maybe it'll pay off for him like it has for your father. But your father is one of the greatest men that I've ever known in my life. He has so much patience. He never has a bad thing to say about anybody. He's funny, he can make you guys laugh without even wanting to make you laugh. My [00:35:00] love for him is as deep and down to the core of my heart as it is for you guys. We went through our ups and downs, but, after going down so many times, we went up and we never went back down. We made sure and we wanted to keep ourselves surrounded by our children and our children to surround us.Alan Mendoza:	That's my family. That's our family that I'm very proud of. All my brothers and sisters, I love them all very much and it's a great family. I wish I could have 41 minutes because I wanted to talk about how active you were in the community in Santa Fe. Then we could go on for two more hours talking about how proud I am, about that, about my mom being the activist and caring for people as much as she does. I'll let her talk for as much time as we have left to tell us a little bit about how you got started with that.Gloria Mendoza:	Well, I got started fighting a golf course in La Cienega. I was the only one opposing it. I went door-to-door and I got the community behind me. Not only did I get the community, I got the whole city of Santa Fe and other surrounding communities to support our cause. That's where I started. I got tired of multi-millionaire people coming in and trying to develop lands, agricultural lands, and destroying beautiful lands, open space that we had in Santa Fe. I just like to give you a list of some of the things I've done. I don't know if you remember all of them, but I did that. I fought the golf course in La Cienega. I also became an international activist. I helped an island in Hawaii fight a golf course in their island out there. They had heard about me and they called me and they wanted my help. So I helped them, and they also succeeded in their opposition to it. I have fought the whip coming down in through our town in Santa Fe on St. Frances drive. I fought whip. They came, all the people from the Department of Energy, and I told them that if they came through St. Frances drive, I was going to have the whole community there and they'd have to run us down. So we stopped the whip from going down there. We've stopped big box stores moving into traditional neighborhoods. We stopped Smith's from going in there. I've taken Pachucos, I've taken elderly, I've taken people to city council meetings to voice their opinions. I'm an organizer of neighborhoods. I love the fact that people can learn to use their voices to save what they do or don't want. I don't know, do you remember any really important ones that you thought? I did so many.Alan Mendoza:	I think everything was important, but I think there was maybe not some of the things that didn't make such huge press or get so much attention. But affordable housing for seniors, tax cuts, to me and just all the little issues in front of the county and fighting for large splits for people to have property for their families. I think those are some of the biggest battles that are won, not necessarily the ones that always make that paper, but you were always fighting for the people that need it.Gloria Mendoza:	Well, I'm known as a spokesperson for the people of Santa Fe, for the Hispanics. Why? Because I have a passion for our people. I have a passion for Santa Fe. I have a passion for any community who is trying to fight things that are trying to throw them out of their communities. I have helped people from all over New Mexico and other cities. I helped Martineztown here in Albuquerque. I helped them keep the federal courthouse from being built in their neighborhood. So I do have a history of it and maybe someday I can record it and just send it to a library or Congress. I don't know if they accept it, but maybe someday [00:40:00] I'll write a book. But thank you, Miho. Thank you. What I did I did for your generation and generations to come.Alan Mendoza:	Well, thanks, mom for taking part in this conversation with me. I love you.Gloria Mendoza:	I love you too, hijo.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
MBY006603,"Tomas:	[00:00:00] My name is Tomas Garduno. I'm 31 years old. Today's date is June 10th, 2010. We're in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I'm here with my dad.Rey:	My name is Rey Garduno. Rey with an E, Rey. I'm 67 years old. Today's date is June 10th, 2010. As Tomas said, we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Tomas is my son.Tomas:	Great, dad. So why don't you tell me a little bit about where you grew up and about your parents?Rey:	Well, I grew up in a small village, really. It was not incorporated or anything. It's north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and it's Nambe. At the time probably, we're about, I'm guessing 70-100 families. As far as how many folks lived there, I'd say probably 300-400 people. It's in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, as I said, very green. There's a river that goes through it, in fact, the Nambe. My parents were subsistence farmers, if you will, my father did farm quite a bit. I don't know how many acres, probably around 10-15 acres. Some of the acreage was ours, meaning our family, the other acreage was my uncle's, his older brother, Tomas, as a matter of fact. We lived there very happily, necessarily, in a level of poverty that today probably would be considered quite poor.Tomas:	So now, I'm named after your tio Tomas.Rey:	My tio Tomas.Tomas:	I don't know what that makes him to me. My second tio Tomas? So what was the relationship like between you and my tocayo?Rey:	Your namesake? Your tocayo?Tomas:	Yeah.Rey:	Yeah. He was the patriarch, I guess, of the family. There were nine brothers, he being the eldest of all in the family, and I believe five sisters, five aunts of mine. He is a great uncle to you. As I said, he was the head of the family. In those days, it was not unusual for, in my case, grandparents, in your case, great-grandparents, to have died at a fairly early age. Probably, life expectancy in those days was anywhere between 45 and 55, so quite young. I only knew one grandfather, and that was my mother's father. So I never did know any of the other family, or at least the grandparents.Tomas:	So why did you decide to name me after my great tio Tomas?Rey:	Well, I'd always be aware of what you think and you romanticized because he was a very independent person, and actually, for many years of his life, his adult life, he was a shepherd, a sheep herder up in Southern Colorado in the Capulin mountains. He used to go up there with anywhere, I'm guessing in numbers, but probably 10,000, and I don't know if you use head when you'd refer to sheep, but 10,000 sheep. I remember visiting as a young kid and being impressed with the fact that it felt or looked like the whole side of a mountain was moving and it was really the sheep that were grazing. I'd just been amazed. He lived in a small trailer, almost like a chuck wagon looking thing. With all the stuff that he needed, pots and pans, and all that stuff hanging on the outside, and I was like, what a romantic life, I'm sure it was tough as nails and I'm sure it was on some level horrible because he spent 6-7 months of his year up in the mountains by himself, absolutely himself.Tomas:	Wow.Rey:	He had to fight off coyotes, not fight off, I mean.Tomas:	Yeah.Rey:	But I mean, make sure they [00:05:00] didn't kill too many of the sheep, although some did get killed. I'm jumping around a little bit, I'm remembering this. Here's always bring, in the fall, when he would then bring the sheep down from the mountains, some jerky and there were gunny sacks full of jerky of both deer and bear that he had killed, some of the bear that were probably killing the sheep. A lot of times, the story that he used to tell was that, the bear would come through and wouldn't necessarily kill one or two to eat, but just almost like a game and they would just, yeah, kill as many as they could, I guess. I guess a bear was a nemesis to a sheep herder. I guess I didn't ask you why and though why was that he was so interesting to me.Tomas:	Okay.Rey:	Lo and behold, the prodigy, and that was just as interesting as the person.Tomas:	So was he ever married? Did he ever have kids?Rey:	No. No, he was a bachelor, I guess that's the term, all his life. In fact, later on in life, I was working on a museum project on Santos. I was doing the photography for the Santos and met a woman who had written a number of books. [inaudible 00:06:29] , I believe her name was, her last name, and it turned out, I found out later that they had had a romantic liaison.Tomas:	Great.Rey:	I don't know, whatever that's called.Tomas:	Interesting.Rey:	It was interesting because I never knew or had heard of any relationship that my uncle Tomas had had.Tomas:	So you got very, what's the word, politicized later on in high school and as you're starting to go to college. How did that process happen? What happened there?Rey:	Well, I'm going to guess, and some of it maybe, you've heard of audited amnesia. Well, I have the opposite, I think I have augmented amnesia. I remember certain things and I place a lot of importance on those things, simply because when I was growing up, there was an organization in the small town and it existed in other parts of Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico, and it was what the term explains, the SPMDTU and it was called the Sociedad Proteccion Mutua de Trabajadores Unidos, which translates roughly to United Laborers for the Mutual Protection of each other. To us, it was just an organization that sometimes we have all events and festivals. That's how we knew it. But underlying all that, was the real reason for it to exist and that was to protect the laborers from that part, if whenever they would go to work for any governmental institution or anything like that. It really was a way for them to hang together. I think later on in life, I realized that what it meant and what is important to us, and just a very quick vignette about that was, when the CC camps, the conservation corp came into well, all over the country, but into New Mexico, northern New Mexico in particular, Santa Fe was the seat where the FD jobs were handed out. A lot of people from northern New Mexico further up north would come into Santa Fe to get some jobs and they never got them. They protested and through this organization were able to then get a fair share, if you will, of the jobs that the government was allocating to folks.Tomas:	It at all was SPMDTU connected at all to the mine workers because it was in southern Colorado too, wasn't it?Rey:	Absolutely. In it predates CC camp. That was just a vignette, but in reality, not reality, but one of the reasons it started was that there were a lot of miners, both gold, silver, coal in southern Colorado, northern New Mexico, Trinidad being one of the centers for coal. I don't know whether people know anything about it, but there was a really atrocious massacre in Ludlow, which is the southern part of Colorado where a lot of people were killed by the Pinkerton guards who worked for Rockefeller and those folks who had mines in that area. [00:10:00] That was another impetus for the SPMDTU, the Sociedad Proteccion Mutua De Trabajadores Unidos to essentially again, establish what they would and wouldn't put up with.Tomas:	Now, the massacre at Ludlow, was that mostly Chicano workers or was it not?Rey:	No, it was quite a few from Eastern Bloc Europe, Italians, and Chicanos' from that area.Tomas:	Then that history got you more involved in the community and getting more politicized?Rey:	Right. Even in high school, we have to jump forward just a little bit. I went to school in Nambe to the sixth grade, seventh grade, which was junior high in those days. I started in Santa Fe, which is like I said, the capital of New Mexico. There is where I first experienced or at least realized that I had lived in a very homogeneous situation with mostly Chicano families of Nambe, and having had a little bit of interaction with, as we call them, Galachos who lived there. But this was their eighth place of residence, and it was all the McCormick's with the Cyrus McCormick family, the Hershey's from Hershey, Pennsylvania, folks like that who probably found Nambe very romanticized third world place to go to. I had that connection, but it was them really and us but never really been able to or have the occasion to interact with those folks. When we moved to Santa Fe, then it was a different thing because I was going to school with a lot of those folks. That's where I think the realization that them meant not just them, but those people in power. It was an interesting relationship because I had never felt that, being that whatever power existed in that very microcosm of Nambe was linear at best. There were people who obviously had more than others. But it wasn't power full and directive and controlling like it was once we moved to Santa Fe and probably exacerbated by the fact that it was a capital city.Tomas:	Then that led you to what? How did you get involved or what did you start doing?Rey:	Well, then I've realized it there were some folks who were outside of I for whatever reasons, was able to participate academically and other ways. In a funny way, during the day, I would identify with the white Anglo folks students, but at night or after school, it was always Chicanos that I hang out with. It gave me an interesting perspective. It was almost a schizophrenic view of life, where during the day I was a certain person and then at night, if you will, I was another, and came to understand the dynamic of what people nowadays call gangs and all that stuff. It was really folks hanging out together again, for mutual protection. It had nothing to do with criminality or some of the things that today is assigned to that social structure. I guess the motivator was that why is it that half of me identifies with one situation and the other half of me identifies with the other. I'm the same person. I think that was the beginning of my getting interested in civil rights. Remember this is 1958, '59, '60, '61, then '62 when I graduated from high school. There was necessarily a growth of feelings and sometimes understanding it very vividly and very strongly, and sometimes being on some level confused, but always interested in what was going on.Tomas:	I remember growing up at our house. We had books: Autobiography of Malcolm X, Che Guevara Speaks, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, speeches by Martin Luther King, [00:15:00] 500 years of Chicano history, those books that obviously you didn't overtly express your politics to me as I was growing up, but they definitely came through in the broader values and the way that we lived our lives. In that, I think I always see that as a way that I began to get more involved and more interested because I knew that that was connected to you somehow, but I never really knew how or what the process that you went through, was to be exposed to those things and begin to get interested in social justice and community work.Rey:	Right. I think going back to the idea of having that duality of experience. What I was most interested in. At school, I was getting the information about Charles Dickens and Edgar Allan Poe. I mean, whatever the white part of that was, I was getting plenty of that. But what I wasn't getting was the other piece, which was who am I really? The only place where I could find that was not in over discussion socially but politically, where can I get this information? That's probably why I gravitated to, not only those volumes in that perspective, but also to counterbalance the information that I was getting readily and in some ways, coercively. There was a certain level of, this is what you need to know about, as opposed to, here's a panoply of everything has to be known and you go wherever you want. So I guess I did gravitate in those publications that spoke to the other part, the part that spoke to me internally. The other spoke to me psychically, if you see here, in an intellectual sense when I would read. I love Emily Dickinson, but it was an experience that I wasn't necessarily familiar with, it was just good poetry. While if I read Malcolm X or other volumes, then I found out what struggle was and what it meant, and not unlike what some of the experiences that I had seen, heard, felt.Tomas:	So when did you start to be exposed to more of a radical politic or more of a social justice analysis?Rey:	Probably when I came to the university in Albuquerque. Yeah, this is having graduated from high school in Santa Fe, came to UNM, the University of New Mexico, and finding out that what I had experienced, the difference between Nambe and Santa Fe, was minuscule and almost petty on some level, or at least smaller than going from Santa Fe to Albuquerque, not because of Albuquerque, but to the cocoon that was the university. In that cocoon, I realized that there was a lot more out there. One of the interesting things was the black-brown divide, where very few of us who were brown at the university, had any place there. Most of us just subsisted, got through, whatever. The people that were paid attention to, as far as people of color were concerned, were black students, African-American students, who had come there primarily because of athletics. So they were then the wedge that the greater society used to essentially tell us that there were other people of color that were more important than us, which was totally confusing. Not having had any experience of growing up with African-American brothers and sisters, did I understand what was going on. So it was a turmoil. So it radicalized me, especially after reading like struggles, the similar, in fact, probably instructive struggles that Malcolm X or what he was expressing and other folks, and wondering why is it that we; black-brown brothers and sisters, Asian Americans, Native Americans, probably more so even, how is it that we can't get it [00:20:00] together? That was one of the impetus for looking into what's the dynamic here.Tomas:	You started at UNM in '60?Rey:	Two.Tomas:	'62.Rey:	Actually, I started in '63, the second semester. I graduated in '62, and I should've started September '62 but I stayed out one semester.Tomas:	So this was still in the fairly beginning stages of the black civil rights movement?Rey:	Right. I was very interested and, in fact, again, to jump a little bit forward in '67, I think it was, I was very strong in the anti-Vietnam War movement. That was another piece where brothers primarily, who were African American and were athletes, were very disdainful of any of us that were anti-war for whatever reasons, whether that was their orientation or whatever, I don't know. But again, it pitted brown-black folks, people of color against each other. It was hurtful but on some level, it was divisive. I don't know whether it was by design, but it certainly was the effect.Tomas:	This was in '63, '64?Rey:	'63, '64, '65.Tomas:	The Vietnam War?Rey:	Started in '58 but we didn't get really involved, we the United States, till about '62. I remember at that time, if you didn't have a 2-S which was a student deferment, you were pretty much assured, especially if you were a person of color, especially if you were in this area, that you would be drafted.Tomas:	Drafted, right. So then you've mentioned to me that you helped start student organizations at UNM and they weren't necessarily overly anti-war, they were more from a civil rights framework.Rey:	In fact, ACOHR was the acronym, it was the Action Committee on Human Rights. What we understood to be human rights at the time, it was primarily civil rights, but it was just making sure that people understood that we were all brothers and sisters. We the people that were at least talking that, that we understood that we all had to struggle together and that was the impetus for that. It did have an element of resisting or at least opposing the war but it wasn't primarily that.Tomas:	It was a multi-racial organization, right?Rey:	Absolutely. In fact, interesting enough, it wasn't a board because I don't think we were that sophisticated, but the five of us that were the folks that put it together and called the meetings and that sort of thing was myself as a Chicano, Greg Johnson who was an Anglo, Joy [inaudible 00:23:20] who was an African-American woman, and there was a gentleman who was a young man who was a Native American but didn't stay with the organization or the group very long and I can't remember what happened. He was from Jemez Pueblo.Tomas:	This is all pretty much pre any of the real or the peak of any of the social movements during those times, right?Rey:	Oh, absolutely. Where it came from, I'm not exactly sure, meaning we didn't have a model to follow. It wasn't like a snake or another organization.Tomas:	Right. Because this was all before those days, right?Rey:	Right. It was, I think, grew out of necessity to just figure out, why is it that there's such pushback on people that don't believe like everyone else or at least what was being shown?Tomas:	So then how did the war affect you? I mean, you actually decided to not allow yourself to be drafted.Rey:	Right. What happened was that I dropped from what was known as a full load, which was 16 hours to I think it was 10 hours at the university, which is part-time student, which takes away your 2-S deferment. In doing that, then I became eligible for the draft. The draft then sent me a letter and I decided not to enlist. Essentially stayed out of that for the number of years [00:25:00] until there was an assignment of numbers and it was a lottery number. Mine ended up being every year, mine was I got 240. It was days of the year, so they would start would have us in number 1, 2, 3, 4 on through there for that year until they got the quota that they needed for that recruitment. Well, they never got to 280 or whatever my number was, so I was not drafted. But for that latter part of the Vietnam War, then of course, Saigon fell, the war was over, and that wasn't an issue anymore.Tomas:	Before the lottery system, when they actually sent you a letter to be drafted, and you didn't respond, did they come after you? Did the US government try to find you?Rey:	I guess they did. Yes they did. I had gone out of the State and they tried through various methods and I don't know all of them, but I know that my family was contacted and asked if they knew where I was, and most of the time, they didn't. I made sure that they didn't know, because that would protect them from having to answer the question illegally or whatever and this honestly, because they didn't know where I was at any one time. During that time that I was away, they weren't able to contact me, so I felt like I wasn't not answering the draft notice, I was just not being contacted.Tomas:	Was it deliberate?Rey:	Yes.Tomas:	Yeah. Because, I mean, you made the decision because you were morally against the wall.Rey:	Absolutely.Tomas:	Was it hard to have to be away from your family and away from your friends for that long?Rey:	Yeah. It's difficult because you don't know what's going to happen from day to day. It was very difficult, I think for my mom. My dad, I'm sure I also felt bad. But it was something to do, with not knowing where your children are, and I didn't know what that meant, but I do now, and I can only imagine what they went through.Tomas:	How long was that for?Rey:	It was about a year and a half, a little more. Actually, almost two years, which doesn't sound like very much, but it's an amazing amount of time that you don't have contact with someone.Tomas:	I know that from the stories that you tell, because of the effect that having those positions and standing up for your rights and then getting the backlash of that, you decided that maybe more of your time should be spent on raising a family and doing that kind of work or that way of living. Was there a particular point at that time that you decided that I'm not going to continue to be overtly political, I'm not going to do that stuff, or was it just happen?Rey:	Well, I think it happened. I hate to use the term responsibility, but there is a level of responsibility when you have a family that it's nothing to be ashamed of it obviously, but it's something that does take you in another direction. In the direction that took me in, was a career. What do I need to do to subsist? What do I need to take care of? So that my family can subsist. From that level, yes it was taking you away from a core feeling and action, but contributes to the support of something that you hold dear. Now I'd like to make sure that we don't forget. This is probably a very opportune time, because at the time that I was doing this career thing, you were growing up, and I heard a little bit about what you said, as far as the subtle or other influences, but what really was your growing up, and then politicization.Tomas:	Like I said, we as a family believe [00:30:00] this and you need to believe that. You guys were very clear about not forcing me to think one way or the other, but there was most definitely values that were imparted through you're all's example and the way that you treated each other, you treated mom, and just the friends and the family that was around them, and being around my aunts, and my uncles, and all those folks all the time was the basis for that. But then I think that there was also a hint, or a tinge of more radical politics that I could hear through your language. The way that you talked about things, the fact that you were always making sure that you run for school board, when I was young, and knew that it was important to try to get involved in your community in different ways. I think, subtly, but inherently that value and the recognition of the importance of making sure that you're involved in your community, and making sure that you're making your voice heard was always there. But really it didn't surface in any overt way until, similarly, I went off to college. Because, in general, I had a pretty typical lower middle-class upbringing as a Chicano in New Mexico. Went to all of the public schools that I was supposed to go to, had friends that I had from almost childhood, from the neighborhood all the way up through high school. That changed a little, but I was sheltered in a good way in the sense that I didn't know anything different than what was in New Mexico, and what was it like to grow up in Albuquerque, going into public schools, being around all types of different folks, but definitely majority Chicanos and Mexicanos. So when I decided to go away for college to Lewis & Clark College, which is a small liberal arts school in Portland, Oregon. It was really a decision that was based upon very little information, because I've just figured that everywhere else was where we were from in a lot of ways. So it was a good thing for me to be exposed to that, it was also very difficult. Because Oregon is one of the widest states in the nation, Portland is one of the widest cities in the nation, and Lewis & Clark is a liberal arts college and most folks of color don't end up going to those schools. So it was a real culture shock for me. I mean going to Juarez for vacations was not a culture shock, but going to Portland, Oregon for college was definitely a culture shock. It was really hard and it was a time for me to really develop my identity and to do it in a way that was more in reaction to and need in to really develop and analyze that. Because as most Chicanos of my generation, I'm 31 years old and my generation, most of our folks, because of the shame and resistance that the US society laid on top of our communities, most of our folks didn't teach us Spanish. Or if they did, we rejected it because we wanted to be Americans or we were brought up in that culture. So going to little some car college and having a white girl come up to me and automatically starts speaking to me in Spanish, and having studied a little bit of Spanish in school and having of course group, grown up with it around your family, around our family, I could understand a little bit but I couldn't speak it real well, which is a typical cultural reality of being a Chicano in United States, growing up in the '80s. But I responded saying, ""Estoy un poco embarazado"" which now, of course, I know means that I was just a little bit pregnant. Of course, I was trying to say I was a little embarrassed that I didn't speak Spanish. Essentially from that time on, I really made my first life goal which was to learn Spanish for two main reasons. One, because I wanted to not allow for that type of cultural racism which is what I think was really going on there to continue. But then also because I knew that there was something in society that had begun to try to divide and ultimately conquer my community and my [00:35:00] family which was the division of language and the taking away of part of our history and our culture which was our language. So that was my first what we call aha moment. Getting more involved in just social change work.Rey:	Was that law hurtful obviously?Tomas:	Yeah, of course. I mean it motivated me to make a whole life change and to make that as a goal which I feel very confident that I've achieved. In that process, it just leads you down a much deeper path to really beginning to critically analyze your surroundings and begin to understand that the way that the world is was set up that way and it can change if need be, and that the more you look at it, the more you realize that there's a lot of changes that need to happen. So some of the motivation and the impetus of being exposed in not an overt way, but begin to learn more of that history and know that it was a part of our family legacy and a part of our heritage and traditions to get involved, speak up, stand up, organize yourself in your community to achieve justice and equality really was a motivating factor in the base of which I operate off of now as a community organizer with the Southwest Organizing Projects, who I think in that process of being politicized through recognizing what racism was and how it felt, really moving beyond that reaction to really understanding how are we going to achieve and build a different world in a different society that is going to be based on different values at the society is not. So getting fluent in Spanish exposed me to living in Latin America, which exposed me to an anti-colonialist and different historical perspective, which got me more involved in recognizing the New Mexico really is a part of Latin America, and we have a very similar history to the rest of Latin America. All these things just begin to build and build and build to help you build your overall political analysis, that for me has motivated but ultimately and absolutely ensured that I needed to dedicate my life to social justice and to ensuring that our communities have the same opportunities and access as everybody else does. That it's really not just about any one individual community or group of people, but we all need to live under and build a society that is based upon the values of social justice and equality. It's just interesting how things bounce back and forth and how they come out of things. Because as I got more involved in this work and in doing social justice, organizing, I then brought you and mom back into the work and you've sense gotten very much, so re-involved if you want to say.Rey:	I have to credit you and the organization that you just mentioned, Southwest Organizing Project. But very quickly, I know we're just about out of time, but if you could just say what amazing work you've been doing lately, including electing me for city council.Tomas:	Yeah. Well, I think the culmination or one of the main stepping stones in this interesting dialectic of your father, my grandfather been involved, you being involved, and then moving away, and then me again involved, because I knew you were involved in bringing you back into the work was our work together on your campaign for city council. So part of the work within the Southwest Organizing Project or SWOP was a recognition that we needed to build power, real power for working class communities of color to be able to implement our demands of social justice. We can't do that unless we are able to influence and affect the current power structure, and those are elected officials. Because no matter how successful we are organizing our communities, we're always [00:40:00] going to have to demand change from somebody. That somebody in this context, our elected officials, because they're the ones who make the decisions around policies and laws and etc. We were continually running up against folks that were not agreeing with us because we hadn't got him elected. That they were elected by big money special interests or other communities, mostly white, mostly affluent communities that voted much higher rates in our communities doing. So we embarked on a path of changing the face of the electorate to represent our communities and our social justice values, and through that process, we were both exposed to the nuts and bolts of how to run a campaign. In this case, it was a nonpartisan get out the vote campaign. But you were able to learn and I was able to learn all the skills. When the city council seat that you now represent came up, it was a natural next step. What better away to influence power and to implement our social justice values than to have somebody that comes out of our organization, sitting up there, making decisions for us. So it's a first step and we're excited to have you in there, but we need eight more of you.Rey:	I would welcome that.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
MBY006605,"Charlene Mendoza:	[00:00:00] My name is Charlene Mendoza. My age is 38. Today is June 10, 2010. Location is Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am Maria Mendoza's niece.Maria Mendoza:	I am Maria Lorraine Mendoza, I'll be 44 next month in July the 7th. Today is June 10, 2010, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and this is Magritte Lanice Charlie. Anyway, we're going to start out with talking about my parents and where they got together and how many children they have, and that was eight children altogether that lived. One of the family members have died, and Joseph Mendoza, he died when he was 21 of suicide. It took a toll on everybody. But my mom and dad, my dad's name is on Antonio Ponce Mendoza and my mom's name is Maria San Juan Lilly Mendoza and before she was Mendoza she was Carasco. But look at that long name, we all have long names.Charlene Mendoza:	Yeah we do, what were your parents like?Maria Mendoza:	They were older. I am the youngest of the family, and they were all there. My mom passed away when she was 42, but she had me when she was 30, I don't know. I was nine when she died. I don't know what that makes it, but they're older but not really having children. My eldest brother was 14 when I was born.Charlene Mendoza:	That's a big difference. How was your relationship with your parents? Was it good?Maria Mendoza:	I don't remember a lot of my childhood. I really don't, and that's probably because of PTSD from having my mom passed away on Christmas day at nine years old. I don't remember a lot, but I remember maybe in the youngest child. So I didn't. I used to tell a lot, and I was the breath, and I was a spoiled one. That's what I remember.Charlene Mendoza:	What was your best memory of your childhood?Maria Mendoza:	My best memory of my childhood. I don't know. School?Charlene Mendoza:	School.Maria Mendoza:	I remember school.Charlene Mendoza:	What about the worst memory of your childhood?Maria Mendoza:	My worst was my mom's death I think.Charlene Mendoza:	Yeah. That would be hard. Do you have a nickname?Maria Mendoza:	I had a couple of nicknames, but the one that stands out to everybody is Mamu, because I'm so dark complected.Charlene Mendoza:	I guess we all got dark names, huh?Maria Mendoza:	The ones that are dark.Charlene Mendoza:	How did you get it? Is that by being dark?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Who gave you that name?Maria Mendoza:	My sister-in-law, Hamlin Mendoza. But your dad still calls me that.Charlene Mendoza:	Yeah.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	That's interesting. Did you enjoy school?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah, I did.Charlene Mendoza:	You graduated?Maria Mendoza:	I graduated with honors in art and partial scholarships to college for art, but it was partial. So I never got to go.Charlene Mendoza:	That's sad. You're good artist. I know that. I've seen a lot of your work. What would you do for fun when you're in school? Do you remember anything fun you used to do?Maria Mendoza:	I used to make jewelry. That's all I did. That was my spare time, that was lunch, that was my break, [00:05:00] that was my extra classes to wait for the bus. I used to make jewelry. Very creative.Charlene Mendoza:	Was there a teacher or teachers who had a particularly strong influence of your life?Maria Mendoza:	Yes. Phil Espana, she was my art teacher, and Barbara Schwartz, she was my jewelry teacher. They just let me hang out. While the teachers were having lunch, the arts department, and I just learned a lot of life through them and goals in making goals and starting my life, actually. Because I was in high school and I didn't know nothing. I really had no sense of direction and I think nobody to tell me, and they helped me a lot.Charlene Mendoza:	That's good, you remember the first and last name. I've had a few good teachers, but I don't remember their names.Maria Mendoza:	I still see Phyllis. Phyllis is the one that married Lauren Salazar (phonetic).Charlene Mendoza:	Wow. So you still visit with her and see her.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Do you have a love of your life?Maria Mendoza:	I have lots of love of my lifes. My main love of my life is my son, and I had to name him a long name.Charlene Mendoza:	What is his name?Maria Mendoza:	His name is Carlitos Jesse Mionico Mendoza. Because he is my only one.Charlene Mendoza:	I didn't know that.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	That's a cute name.Maria Mendoza:	He's not my biological son, he is my biological great nephew.Charlene Mendoza:	Right.Maria Mendoza:	But he came into my home when he was three months old and I adopted him.Charlene Mendoza:	Now, how old is he?Maria Mendoza:	He is four-and-a-half.Charlene Mendoza:	Four-and-a-half. Wow, how exciting.Maria Mendoza:	It's a long road on that one. Talk about family issues. His grandpa, my brother, one my oldest brother's just pretty much disowned me for three years, led the boy's life, just because he had some notion that I was doing it on purpose to take them away.Charlene Mendoza:	When you weren't you were trying to help-Maria Mendoza:	Just help and keep them in the family. That's all.Charlene Mendoza:	Somebody else, the state or something like that would happen?Maria Mendoza:	No.Charlene Mendoza:	But things are better with you and your brother now?Maria Mendoza:	Oh, yeah. After all that threats and mass and all that, the love is still there.Charlene Mendoza:	Well, that's good.Maria Mendoza:	But you get burned and you hesitate, there is still a little mistrust there but I don't trust that much, but I love him. I'll do anything for him.Charlene Mendoza:	That's your brother. But in the long run it's going-Maria Mendoza:	That's my Carlito would rather do.Charlene Mendoza:	Grandpa.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. That's how he knows them too. His grandpa, he doesn't know him as uncle. Because even my brother, he knows him as grandpa. He knows him the way they're supposed to be, everybody, his cousins, his aunts and uncles.Charlene Mendoza:	That's good. I never thought of that because I do know that Angelica is his mom too.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	She does know his [inaudible 00:08:51]Maria Mendoza:	She's never going to be out of life. She's my family, she's my niece.Charlene Mendoza:	Good job.Maria Mendoza:	Plus it will be easier for me to explain everything later when he starts asking.Charlene Mendoza:	Yeah, asking what's really what's going on. Where did I come from, and whatnot?Maria Mendoza:	That's going to be a story. This is going to be good for him.Charlene Mendoza:	Have something to say for him, that's good.Maria Mendoza:	You said I have a lot of loves.Charlene Mendoza:	I know you do. Because I'm one of them.Maria Mendoza:	Their children.Charlene Mendoza:	My kids.Maria Mendoza:	All your kids are my grandchildren.Charlene Mendoza:	You helped me so much when they're younger too. But that's what I would've done. Make sure they always had close and whatnot.Maria Mendoza:	That's the binding connection.Charlene Mendoza:	What is your ethnic background?Maria Mendoza:	[00:10:00] Mexican-American, I guess. Because my dad's family was from Mexico and my mom's family was from here, I guess.Charlene Mendoza:	Mexican-American.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Let's see. Where was I? Okay. Where's your mom from. It has family. Have you ever been to Mexico?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	I've never been to Mexico. Is it nice out there?Maria Mendoza:	Yes. It's nice. There's some nice areas.Charlene Mendoza:	YesMaria Mendoza:	I've never been into. I don't know, but I do have like a flash memory maybe, of going one time with my dad to family members homes out there. But I don't know if that was a memory or a dream or what. But I remember being there.Charlene Mendoza:	Interesting. Who are your favorite relatives?Maria Mendoza:	My favorite relatives aren't my favorite relatives anymore.Charlene Mendoza:	It changed through the years, I take it?Maria Mendoza:	Wow, my favorite relatives. Probably my cousins from Berlin and the Mendoza cousins. Other than my immediate close like you and I and everybody like that, outside the family it's probably my cousins, Rudy, Randy, Frankie, and Adolfito, and all of them over there. My uncle, Paul. I love my uncle, Paul.Charlene Mendoza:	He's the one in Berlin?Maria Mendoza:	Yes. He's the one that didn't get along the most with my dad.Charlene Mendoza:	They were brothers?Maria Mendoza:	Yes.Charlene Mendoza:	What's all this fighting with family? I don't understand.Maria Mendoza:	That's the way they were raised.Charlene Mendoza:	What traditions have you passed down in your family?Maria Mendoza:	Hugging. My family never hugged or said I love you. Never.Charlene Mendoza:	Now we do it all the time.Maria Mendoza:	No we do it all the time.Charlene Mendoza:	We say hi, bye.Maria Mendoza:	Now we say hi and when we say goodbye, hug. I love you when we're talking on the phone and that's I think was the most biggest accomplishment to pass in our family because we're tough, prideful, stubborn. But this always brings out a little nudge of love. Just a hug.Charlene Mendoza:	It helps takes away everything.Maria Mendoza:	Yes. I think I changed a lot. You know how they say you should break that cycle or whatever? I think us, we've broken a lot of cycles. I have broken it to you and you've broken it to yours. You know what I mean?Charlene Mendoza:	I do.Maria Mendoza:	So that's pretty cool.Charlene Mendoza:	We're even getting the older ones, our parents to say they love us now.Maria Mendoza:	Yes. I know I freak out.Charlene Mendoza:	You're not used to it.Maria Mendoza:	I never heard it though from my dad.Charlene Mendoza:	Me neither.Maria Mendoza:	I don't remember it from my mom. The I love you or an initiative hug.Charlene Mendoza:	Just wasn't heard of to show affection to your kids or whatnot.Maria Mendoza:	Yes. But I knew he loved me. There's just a way I just knew.Charlene Mendoza:	I'm sure he did. Of course, he did. Can you tell me about your religious beliefs or spiritual beliefs?Maria Mendoza:	I am non-denominational, which means I don't have a religious belief. I just believe in God. God the Father, God the son, and God the Holy Spirit, heaven and hell. That's it. I'm a little preacher of love always because that's what God wants us to do, [00:15:00] right? Forgive. It's hard to do it.Charlene Mendoza:	It's the hardest thing to do in life.Maria Mendoza:	It's really hard. But I learned a lot with that and it changed my life. I mean, just being good, being what God wants you to do, do unto others as you have done unto you.Charlene Mendoza:	Have you ever experienced any miracles?Maria Mendoza:	Yes, just the other day, oh my gosh. I called you when I'd had the blow out. I had a blow out on my tire and it still ran like if it was normal. So I ran it into the median of the freeway and I was on the freeway when it happened. So that freaked me out when I had a big old pop, but nothing happened. So I just looked like nothing happened. But I said no, that was something in my car. Actually I slowed down and pulled to the side. There was tread missing and my tire was still full. Tell me if God don't love me.Charlene Mendoza:	That's enough to get you right off the road and get you to safety.Maria Mendoza:	My miracle is my baby. Carlito is my angel. God sent him to me. God knew. He knew I wanted a kid all my life and I've always prayed for a boy. I never did go and try and do anything. I did try and get pregnant once.Charlene Mendoza:	Once. One time. Once upon a time.Maria Mendoza:	It didn't happen for a reason, see.Charlene Mendoza:	Because he was coming along.Maria Mendoza:	God had his plan for me.Charlene Mendoza:	Okay. I like this one. When you meet God, what do you want to say to him or her?Maria Mendoza:	Thank you. That's about it. That covers it all.Charlene Mendoza:	Do you believe in the afterlife?Maria Mendoza:	I believe in different cultures, different beliefs. I believe that people believe these things and I listen to them. I don't believe that there's an afterlife for myself. I believe that once you die, you go to heaven or hell. I guess it's afterlife because you live forever in heaven or you live forever in hell. In that way, yeah, I do. But afterlife, as far as reincarnation or ghost or that, I am pretty open-minded about all that, and I will talk to people who are interested in all that and believe all that. But like I said, I believe in God and if he didn't make it create it or do it, it doesn't exist.Charlene Mendoza:	Let's see. Do you ever think about dying? Are you scared?Maria Mendoza:	I'm not scared of dying. I'm scared of what may be left behind. I'm scared of the time of death. Like if I were to die now, my baby, that's what I'm scared of. But I have plans already.Charlene Mendoza:	Yes. It's all taken care of. He is very well taken care of. Or he will be if anything happens.Maria Mendoza:	I willed my baby to her.Charlene Mendoza:	He'll be mine.Maria Mendoza:	If I pass before my time.Charlene Mendoza:	But no you won't. We're not thinking that. Just a question. Do you regret anything?Maria Mendoza:	I have one big regret and I'll tell you and I'll tell everybody in this world never to do. Steal from your parents. I stole from my dad. I admitted it to him and I apologized for it, but it was wrong. [00:20:00] He never got over it, neither did I.Interviewer:	Can I ask you a question? How do you get over it? How do you deal with it?Maria Mendoza:	When my dad was alive, I asked his forgiveness and he forgave me. We were able to establish a relationship when I was an adult. So I think of our good times, me and my dad, and know that he had forgiven me. That's how I get over it.Charlene Mendoza:	Good job. Okay. I see.Maria Mendoza:	Everybody in my family was all big in having a relationship with my mom, but they were all there and they got to have a relationship with my mom. My childhood memories of my dad when I was a child he aren't there, and so my relationship with my dad is a big thing. I could talk to him about anything. We talked about everything too. When he kept asking me one year after about the third girl I took home, he said, ""When you're going to get married? I told him, ""Dad, if I get married, I want to marry woman."" He was, ""How? Come on.""Charlene Mendoza:	What are you talking about?Maria Mendoza:	From there on, he just was cool. He was just so cool with me.Charlene Mendoza:	He had the marriage things light?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. He didn't say anything else after that. ""How are you going to have babies?"" ""Watch dad, you'll see.""Charlene Mendoza:	How many babies one way or another?Maria Mendoza:	It's artificial. He would just laugh. Then when Carlitos came into my life, I said, ""See that? I don't need to go have a baby. I don't need a man. God gave him to me anyway.""Charlene Mendoza:	So the piping, that would be the happiest moment in your life?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	When you got your son?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Or the day of the adoption probably?Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. Because we went through hell. Just that the whole family isolation and the whole wonder of what's going to happen with Carlitos took three years.Charlene Mendoza:	Wow.Maria Mendoza:	It took three years.Charlene Mendoza:	That's a long time.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	But luckily, you got to keep him during that process.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. Through that whole time, yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Yeah, that's good.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah, there's a really good bond with me and him.Charlene Mendoza:	Who was the most important person in your life?Maria Mendoza:	Was or is?Charlene Mendoza:	Either.Interviewer:	Both.Charlene Mendoza:	Both.Maria Mendoza:	Wow. Carlitos, again. He's my most important person. He's always had me going, living life, accomplishing goals. He's like everything.Charlene Mendoza:	How did your life change once you had a son?Maria Mendoza:	Oh my gosh. I was single and scandalous. Then I was locked up in baby bottles.Charlene Mendoza:	Shitted diapers.Maria Mendoza:	Shitted diapers. He changed me a lot. I mean, he helped me gain interest in life and wanting to be here.Charlene Mendoza:	Too much history for me. Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	Now, I'm having grandkids.Maria Mendoza:	That's what your kid did for me too before Carlitos. Now, you g-ma.Charlene Mendoza:	I know, I'm g-ma.Maria Mendoza:	You're too young to be grandma.Charlene Mendoza:	No grandma here. Who has been the kindest [00:25:00] to you in your life?Maria Mendoza:	The kindest, probably you. Because you have respect for me and you know me, and you tell me your point of view whether I'm going to like it or not, knowing you know, I'm probably won't make it.Charlene Mendoza:	But at least say it a nice way.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. I know you love me, that's why. My brother Leo, he's classified as mentally handicapped. Learning disability is what he had, and he's a year older than me, but he is maybe 20 years younger than me in his head. You know what I mean? But that boy has been a lifesaver to me too. He's helped me, he's consulted me, he's been a shoulder, and nobody can say anything or do anything that'll make me change my mind of loving him the way I do. He just is unconditional, just like you. But everybody in his life has ridiculed him for being retarded. But nobody knows the side I do love, his intelligence, his ideas, his inventions, his mind, and nobody knows that.Charlene Mendoza:	They don't give him enough time.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	What are the most important lessons you've learned in life?Maria Mendoza:	Like that song goes to, ""Live Like You Were Dying."" Try not to take life so serious, making every little thing be a big thing.Charlene Mendoza:	I hear you. Are there any words of wisdom you'd like to pass along to me?Maria Mendoza:	Words of wisdom. Love always. Let go and let God.Charlene Mendoza:	That's one I have to remember. I don't always let go. It's my problem. When in life have you felt most alone?Maria Mendoza:	At Christmas time. After my mom died, we didn't celebrate Christmas. My dad would take us out of town and go and visiting his family in Arizona. So we knew Christmas time was coming because we were going on vacation, and so it was always pointed at my face, but it's the most time I felt alone.Charlene Mendoza:	Well, I can't let that happen anymore. You have to do your house all up with Christmas. Has your life been different than what you'd imagined?Maria Mendoza:	Yes. I always thought how my life would be if my mom had lived, and I forgot what I was going to say. What was the question again?Charlene Mendoza:	How has your life been different than what you had imagined?Maria Mendoza:	Because one, I didn't have a mom and I always wondered how that life would have been. But it's this life [00:30:00] that I have now, and it's taken a lot of different turns in my life. I've had a lot of different turns, and this last one with Carlitos has taught me the most about life. For real, and it's taught me the unconditional love to the bone. It's taught me responsibility, empathy, and control.Charlene Mendoza:	How to take deep breaths.Maria Mendoza:	How to take deep breath.Charlene Mendoza:	Count to 10.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Charlene Mendoza:	How would you like to be remembered?Maria Mendoza:	That I was a good person. That it didn't matter what people did or said about me. They knew I loved them.Charlene Mendoza:	Very true, we know that. So what does your future hold?Maria Mendoza:	My future is getting married and raising my child and helping him with his.Charlene Mendoza:	Wow, I can't imagine when you start having kids and join high school, my goodness.Maria Mendoza:	No, I can't. I'm not letting him grow up yet.Charlene Mendoza:	Okay, let's see. What is your first memory of me?Maria Mendoza:	My first memory of you is at the little apartment on Foothill Road. You guys lived down the hill from us when we were little, and I don't know what we were doing or what we were playing, but you came out in this little, yellow car with the red door. That's my first memory of you.Charlene Mendoza:	I have pictures of that little car. I think my mom does.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah. My mom did too, I think. That's why I remember that.Charlene Mendoza:	Okay, let's see. Where will we be in 10 years?Maria Mendoza:	In 10 years? I believe I'm going to have set my home business to where I can continue staying home full-time for Carlitos until he's gone to college. That's where I'm going to be, and you are going to be alongside of me probably, if it gets that good.Charlene Mendoza:	Nice, I'd like to stay home and take care of kids.Maria Mendoza:	I know.Charlene Mendoza:	Once one comes, they all keep coming in.Maria Mendoza:	You remember how we used to have your kids, Elena's kids?Charlene Mendoza:	All the kids.Maria Mendoza:	Sleeping over and all at one time.Interviewer:	I do have questions.Charlene Mendoza:	Go ahead.Interviewer:	You mentioned your father a lot, and you mentioned Carlitos a lot.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Interviewer:	What would you want Carlitos to know about your father?Maria Mendoza:	I would work Carlitos to know that my dad was raised in the hard times of life, and so he lived through the depression, and he lived through being a pachuco and that era and through all that, he still raised eight kids and was able to love in the way that he knew how. I do want Carlitos to know that he's got a strong family bloodline starting with my dad.Charlene Mendoza:	I agree.Maria Mendoza:	That it doesn't matter what people say about my dad. He loved us. He did. He loved Carlitos. Carlitos was the first of all [00:35:00] his grandkids here as showed.Charlene Mendoza:	To love.Maria Mendoza:	Love. He actually would give Carlitos hugs and Carlitos would go and mess with his oxygen thing from his nose. He'd take his cane away and take off playing with this cane. My dad couldn't get up from where he was until he brought it back. He loved Carlitos. He did. He would call Carlitos, Carlito.Charlene Mendoza:	Carlito.Maria Mendoza:	Carlito, soup.Interviewer:	I have more questions. Now you're a mom.Maria Mendoza:	Yeah.Interviewer:	How would you describe your mom to Carlitos?Maria Mendoza:	All I knew of my mom was that she was the center of our family for the love that we weren't getting from my dad. So I'll probably tell Carlitos that his nana, because his grandpa was tata, and his nana was probably very loving and when she passed, she left a lot of people sad because she wasn't around anymore.Interviewer:	Any advice for Carlitos? Eventually, he'll get to listen to this, he'll be old. Maybe life advice for him?Maria Mendoza:	Just be strong. Don't be afraid to cry. Love always. The things that he is learning now as a child and praying and going to church and stuff like that, I'm hoping that will be instilled in him as he grows and no matter what he does or says, just as long as he's happy. He needs to be happy in his life and stay on the good side. That's it, I think.Interviewer:	That's it. Thank you.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
MBY006606,"Interviewer:	[00:00:00] Go.Jose Armas:	My name is Jose Armas. I'm 66 years old. Today is June 11th, 2010. We're in Albuquerque in New Mexico, and today I'm having a plática with my friend, Frank Sanchez.Frank Sanchez:	My name is Frank Sanchez. I'm 59 years old. Today's date is June 11th, 2010. We're doing a plática in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I'm doing the plática with my very best friend, Jose Armas.Jose Armas:	Okay, Frank. So we've known each other more than 40 years, and most of our 40 years, I think that we probably had been involved in similar kinds of activities. Something that is gaining revival now these days, and that is being community organizers. For the longest time, being a community organizer had a negative connotation. But it seems like now being an organizer is having a positive thing. But that certainly has not changed the work that you've done for the last 40 years and the work that I had been involved in also. I'm really glad, I'm proud to be here talking to you because I think, Frank that you probably in the history of New Mexico is someone that is going to have a major presence in the accomplishments in the advancement of our community and the culturally distinct populations of New Mexico.Jose Armas:	Just by way of a little more introduction, you've been working throughout the state and throughout the country actually. But your major impact has been in the area of a voter rights and education, and you have been responsible for having an incredible record, incredible record of legally challenging the institution to make them responsive to local communities. I believe you have been involved in at least 15 court cases that you haven't lost not a single case.Frank Sanchez:	That's correct.Jose Armas:	Could you talk a little bit about some of these things that you were involved in?Frank Sanchez:	Yeah, if I can, let me back up a little bit, Jose, I've been in and around the company organizing for 40 years. In fact, what I consider my very first community organizing activity is when we established the student organization at Eastern New Mexico University called AHORA, association to help our Raza events, and on my own, every September when we established that organization, I do some reflection and also I celebrate with my family because of that founding in my history and in working with community organizing.Frank Sanchez:	When we say community organizing, I think the best affirmation that a community organizer can get when doing their work is that at the end of an issue, end of an election campaign, end of something that the community is working on, is that the community says, ""We did it."" Not that you did it, but we did it, and I think that's always to me, been the strongest affirmation. It's true I've been in and around organizing for 40 years, both directly and indirectly as working for a foundation that funds community organizing. Primarily, I've worked all over the state of New Mexico, the southwestern of the country, but my activism and organizing primarily has been in Southeastern New Mexico, which commonly has been referred to as Little Texas, not because of its geography, but because of its history of prejudice, discrimination and racism against the minorities, especially Latinos in that area. So that's a region that I've been most involved in.Jose Armas:	Can I ask you about Little Texas? The characteristics of Little Texas 40 years ago, what did it look like over there?Frank Sanchez:	You could actually, Little Texas, imagine not as extreme, but imagine a southern town in Mississippi where there was housing segregation, schooling segregation, communities, [00:05:00] Latino community and Anglo community did not have any relationships, hardly. Where I started out working was organizing, first as a student and then as a committee organizer, and the community was Portales, New Mexico. You can just imagine going back 40 years ago where you had North Portales, which was where the Mexican American population lived, and South Portales where the Anglo population, and it was pretty well segregated, 99 percent of the Anglos lived in south and 99 percent of Mexican Americans lived in the north.Frank Sanchez:	But you could see the dramatic differences. Just as soon as you cross the railroad track, no pavement, dilapidated housing, bad infrastructure, maybe one school where all Mexican Americans attended, and basically Latinos shut out of most of the downtown businesses as well as any of the professional jobs at the city, county, state, were just totally shut out. Then we had no representation on any of the governmental entities, school boards, city councils, county commissions, no state representatives, no state senators. We had none of that. So we were basically disengaged, disenfranchised completely out of the whole realm of a community, the whole decision-making process of the community.Jose Armas:	In that community, you were there as a student at Eastern University originally from Roswell, but in that community of Portales, you were involved in a number of initiatives. One of them was a landmark court case that has resulted in millions and millions and millions of children being affected by the outcomes of what happened in Portales. Why don't you explain what happened there?Frank Sanchez:	I think again, I have to back up a little bit and talk about our activity on the university. First of all, when we came to the university, fortunately we were part of-- most of the Latinos that came to Eastern New Mexico University were part of Upward Bound, these government programs that work that really actually got-- like I was, in my family the second to go to college after my sister, but many of my friends that were Mexican Americans, they were the first to go to college because of Upper Bound. But when we got to the university, we found that we were a very small minority. Even though we were then about 25-30 percent of the population in Southeastern New Mexico, we might have been about five percent of the university.Frank Sanchez:	So we saw these glaring inequities, so we challenged first the university and their recruitment and their curriculum and their hiring. So we made some improvements there. But we started up a tutoring program, AHORA, the organization that we founded, and we began to go into the community and we began to learn about the discrimination and the racism and the inequities facing the Mexican American community in Portales, and we learned that first of all, there was zero minority teachers, zero Latino teachers. We learned in our organizing that there was no bilingual programs, no special programs for Latino children, there was no one on the school board the community could talk to, and there was all kinds of different discrimination.Frank Sanchez:	Part of the worst thing you can't even imagine, you don't think that it even happened in New Mexico, because of New Mexico being a heavy Hispanic population, children were still being punished for speaking Spanish on the playground. So that's what got us going. We made a number of demands to the school board. We formed a number of organizations; Chicano Youth Association, which later grew to chapters all over Southern New Mexico. We made education one of our core agenda. We formed Chicano Welfare Rights Organization to deal with income support issues. We formed North Portales Community Association, or we revived that to begin to do things about the infrastructure issues and the pavement issues affecting the [00:10:00] community.Jose Armas:	Before you go on Frank let me ask you this because I know there was one incident that happened with respect to the Welfare Rights Organization that you guys were working with. Talk about this situation that happened when you went to see Governor Bruce King related to welfare rights concerns.Frank Sanchez:	It was actually an issue that we won, we had been demanding that when the school year came around, at that time was called Welfare. Welfare would give a supplement to women on income support, that they would give a clothing supplement to their children because that was always an issue. A lot of the families didn't have any money to buy clothing for their children, it's like the typical family, you would spend $100 and put some new clothes on your children. So we demanded that.Frank Sanchez:	Then I think it was called a Welfare Commission. We took a bus loan, old broken down bus, we brought it out there of a single head of household of women. We essentially took over the Welfare Commission. They did not want to make a decision. The women blocked the doors and said, we're not leaving this room till we have a decision on the clothing supplement. Fortunately, the Welfare Commission agreed to the clothing supplement. It was a great lesson for the people involved because they learned that if they were organized, spoke up for what they cared and believed in and their families, that they could reach some accomplishments. There was many more issues like that that we tried to build supplements in for.Jose Armas:	Can you mention some of the leaders that were involved in the Welfare Rights Organization?Frank Sanchez:	That's really important, Jose, because these are persons that I've always gotten my inspiration. Some of them have passed and they keep me motivated. There was Simona Mesa, which was like our matriarch, and she was our inspiration. She had been involved a little bit in California. She was from New Mexico, but she had moved away to California. She had been involved a little bit in the United Farm Workers Movement in California. So she brought that passion and inspiration and tactics back and she really inspired us.Frank Sanchez:	Then there was Consa Lopas, who was the president of Chicano Welfare Rights Organization who was so passionate, never took a step back. To me she's not written up in history but she is much a hero or heroine to me as some of the great civil rights leaders from the South. She inspired women all over Southeast New Mexico to organize their families. So those are a couple of people.Frank Sanchez:	Then there was Julie Serna who was actually an elementary student and her mom Ramona Serna, which were the lead plaintiffs based on the demands that we made on the school board. Then we did a follow-up lawsuit challenging the school system was called Serna versus the Portales school system, and we challenged them based on some of the issues I mentioned before. Lack of bilingual education, no minority teachers, bad facilities in terms of the schools, punishing children for speaking Spanish.Jose Armas:	To give the listener maybe a little bit of a sense of the kind of thing, of the climate that existed, the kind of repercussions that the police department and the city and the schools tried to impose on people who were trying to organize. Can you talk just at least to give a little bit of a sense of the kind of obstacles that this community, that was powerless really, because they had little representation in any of the elected offices or agencies there, and yet they chose to stand up to the institutions. They suffered major repercussions as a result of their stand.Frank Sanchez:	Yeah, very much so. There was intense fear. People were fired from their jobs. We had a couple of city employees fired because of their involvement in Chicano Youth Association. We had a centro there called Centro de Aztlán. My [00:15:00] apartment where I lived, I actually lived in the centro, was firebombed at least two or three times. My van was blown up, firebombed but blown-up. Eventually blew up because of the firebomb. People were shot at, intimidated, people were arrested several times.Frank Sanchez:	During that time, we had taken on a little local store that was there, that was owned by an Anglo, but was very exploitative of the people there in his little store and was also sexually harassing the young women that would go in there, young Mexican American women. So we took him on, called for a boycott. We had a picket line across from the store. There wasn't a day that went by that we were on that picket line when four or five men were always there across street brandishing rifles and trying to intimidate us. Then eventually we actually got arrested.Frank Sanchez:	The reason we got arrested was for singing De Colores which is a religious, very traditional Mexican song. They said, because they didn't understand, it sounded like profanity. So we were actually arrested. We were sent to jail, then later that evening there was a huge rally by the community demanding that we be-- and more people were arrested. So I think a total of 15, 20, 25 people were arrested for that incident. Eventually that arrest was ruled unconstitutional, we had a right to picket and a right to participate. Right to free speech. A couple more times we got arrested. But there was intimidation, fear, loss of jobs, peer pressure. This is the first time that there had been that kind of challenge to the Anglo establishment in Portales.Jose Armas:	Weren't there people that were stopped by cops and cited numerous times?Frank Sanchez:	Yeah, that was part of it. The police had all our license plates and we were constantly stopped and constantly harassed. People that had contracts or jobs with the Anglo community, they threatened them with their jobs and with their contracts. So there was a lot of a lot of that going on. The newspaper continued to editorialize against us.Frank Sanchez:	But we persevered and because of the lawsuit and because of the organizing, when we first filed a lawsuit, one of their first arguments, they said they couldn't find minority teachers. After we filed a lawsuit, that summer all of a sudden they hired 10. It was the first time. They hired 10 Mexican American teachers. That was a huge victory. Then eventually we won the lawsuit, which not only improved the education system in Portales, improved it all over the country because it established bilingual education as part of a remedy for equal education. But the judge said in his ruling was that because there was not bilingual education, that the Portales school system was not providing equal education. Jose Armas:	Well you know, in this country, when I read about bilingual education, most of the information or the literature that I read gives credit to the Lau versus Nichols case for bilingual education. But can you talk about how that relates to what was happening in Portales with that landmark court case?Frank Sanchez:	It is true Lau is one of the foundational lawsuits for bilingual education, but also Serna built upon Lau and it was specifically geared to Mexican Americans.Frank Sanchez:	That was the focus of it, and that's why it was so important. It's still, for years after, cited in establishing bilingual programs, and I just know right in the immediate area, Roswell, Clovis, it's cited as a foundation for bilingual education.Jose Armas:	Wasn't the Lau versus Nichols case, didn't they use the Serna versus Portales as their authority?Frank Sanchez:	Yes. It was one of their authorities, one of their [00:20:00] most important. That's why I'm saying one of the foundational principles for bilingual education. Again, people were so organized there. The evidence was so overwhelming especially when we proved that children were being punished for speaking Spanish. They were actually applying corporal punishment for speaking Spanish.Jose Armas:	Yeah. What made this case a landmark court case? What distinguished it from other winning of discrimination suits and things that...Frank Sanchez:	Well, I think what made it distinguish was the remedy where the judge ordered certain things to happen that they institute a bilingual education program. As far as I know, that was the first time that a judge said, ""You must implement a bilingual education program.""Jose Armas:	So they found that there was discrimination, and then the judge says, therefore, you must do this to remedy.Frank Sanchez:	You must do this and that it completely agreed with the plaintiffs, completely agreed with us, and so that laid the framework for bilingual programs I knew at least all over the state and the region.Jose Armas:	Certainly it impacted bilingual education programs around the country, which again, millions of children have been a part of bilingual education programs that are directly related to the efforts that were done in Portales.Frank Sanchez:	Exactly.Jose Armas:	From there it seemed like that created a basis or a climate of a can-do attitude on the part of the community that you worked with, and that led to some of your other most major activities that had to do with voter rights. Now you with all the suits that you've been involved in, that you personally have either been the lead plaintiff or have been associated with the suits, that you have not lost one case. As a result of the winning of those cases against the state, against local governments, have resulted in the election of more Latinos and Native Americans than anybody else, as any other events that have happened in the last generation. Can you talk about the first voter rights case that you brought against the state of New Mexico?Frank Sanchez:	Sure. Again, the reason we filed the voting rights lawsuits was because of what we were confronting in all these communities, whether it be Silver City, Las Cruces, Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Artesia, Portales, Roswell, Hobbs is that, for example, we always were strong advocates of good public education for Mexican Americans. When we will go to the decision-makers, they were all Anglo, and not only were they Anglo, they were insensitive and denied our request, our demands for changing the school system to improve it for Latinos.Frank Sanchez:	So based on that, we were constantly confronting. We had no power, no influence over those persons that could make the changes. So we saw that we didn't have any Latinos on school boards and commissioned city council. So in 1981, the legislature passed what they called, Redistricting Bill which they redistricted the State House of Representatives. At that time, it was a coalition that created the redistricting plan of conservative Democrats. At the time the conservative Democrats from Southeastern New Mexico and Republicans from the North. They had something called the Cowboy Coalition, and they created this redistricting plan that totally discriminated against Latinos, not only in Southern New Mexico but all over the state.Frank Sanchez:	We filed on two counts, one is that it violated the constitution and the one person one vote rule, and the second was on voting rights. So the first part of the lawsuit, we challenged the whole redistricting plan. They used the votes cast formula, which totally violated the one person one vote rule. Right here in Albuquerque, they were packing 90 percent of the Latino population into one district. Which means that you could actually create a two or three districts. [00:25:00] That was a mechanism to dilute the voting power of Mexican Americans and Native Americans all over the state.Frank Sanchez:	Then the second thing they did, we won that immediately. The court made them go to a one person one vote rule. Then the second part of that was more our concern in the Native American areas, Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, and then Mexican American and southern New Mexico. What they did is, in voting rights speak or voting rights act language, they cracked the communities. In other words, they would go to where we were concentrated as a population, and divide us up three ways or divide us up two ways. So that meant we cannot create a district where the majority was Latino. That's what they were creating.Frank Sanchez:	So each legislative district would get 70 percent Anglo, 25 percent, 30 percent Latino district. So we challenged that and then after about a year, we prevailed on that. We challenged 17 districts across the state in the Native American areas, Pueblo and Navajo, and then all across Southern New Mexico, and we actually prevailed on 15 of the 17 districts. When I say prevailed was, the courts gave the legislature one more chance to go back and do it right. They didn't do it right and so the court implemented our plan. We had submitted a plan to the court.Frank Sanchez:	But that lawsuit, the opinion of the three judges, because the plaintiffs were so organized and presented their evidence in such a powerful way, and it was the truth, that the judges said that there was discrimination all across Southern New Mexico, that the election methods in the Southeast part of the state shut out Mexican Americans from participation. So we prevailed. And then immediately after that, for the first time in the history of Southeastern New Mexico, three Latinos were elected to the state legislature. The first Latina woman ever from Chaves County. The first Latino from--Jose Armas:	Who were they?Frank Sanchez:	Barbara Perea-Casey, Vicente... I forget his name, Mario Chavez, were the first three. But in Chaves County it was was Barbara Perea-Casey. They were the first three ever elected. So it was history. But of course these lawsuits, more than just about electing Latinos. More than anything, it provides for Mexican Americans to elect candidates of their choice. And what we've found since these lawsuits is that everyone running has to campaign in the Latino community. They have to come and speak to the Latino community. The first one was Vicente Gallegos, I'm sorry, in Curry County. So those were some.Frank Sanchez:	But this lawsuit, because it was so powerful, well-organized, it laid the framework for more lawsuits against school boards, county commissions, city councils, and over the next, from '82 on, next four or five years, we just prevailed on every case. We created what they call single member districts and districts that would give Latinos opportunities to elect candidates of their choice. Then for the first time, especially, during the '80s, the first Latino school board member was elected to Curry County. The first county commissioner Latino was elected in Chaves County, the first ever-- two were elected in Eddy County. So this started happening. And in other parts of the state like Silver City, I think it's called Grant County, they elected a majority of the city council and the majority of the county commission were Latino because they were districts now. So people had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.Jose Armas:	As opposed to being at large.Frank Sanchez:	As opposed to being at large. Before, all the elections in New Mexico were at large, which basically diluted the minority voting. Our experience with that large elections were, we had a school board for many years in Roswell where we actually did a map where basically the five school board members were all neighbors. They were all within 8-10 block area. That's who ran the school board. With a Latino student population then, [00:30:00] it's majority now, but then of about 30 percent.Jose Armas:	So this is huge, and you have been a central part of creating this history in New Mexico. I'd like to talk about, you had a hundred-- you're batting 1000.Frank Sanchez:	Yes.Jose Armas:	Winning all the legal challenges that you have made in the state, at all levels. But you also had a situation in Artesia, for example, that involved a city workers strike which you say that you guys lost. But did you lose there? You talked about, you may have lost the battle but you won something much bigger. Talk about that organizing effort. .Frank Sanchez:	Let me just say something about the lawsuits. I have to say that you never do these things alone. I was one of the participants. In the original lawsuit, we had 45 plaintiffs along with me. I ended up the lead plaintiff. We had the All Indian Pueblo Council, the Navajo tribe, the GI Forum, and several other community organizations. So it was more than just about me. I think that's important.Frank Sanchez:	Now going to Artesia, Artesia was a very bitter city worker strike which polarized the community. The city workers were being underpaid, no benefits, and they wanted a union so they can improve their working conditions. There was about 70 workers that went on strike mostly Mexican American or a few African-Americans and one or two Anglos in that workforce and it completely polarized the community. It was a bitter strike that lasted for two years. The people were courageous and they hung in there, and we never resolved that strike.Frank Sanchez:	The workers, I still remember Ramon Hernandez, who was the president, when they offered them a deal to go back to work but they wouldn't take the leaders of the strike, they would only take what they thought were not leaders of the strike, and the workers all came together and said, ""No, we're not taking this deal. We're not going back to work."" They never did go back to work there. Eventually, the working conditions improved, but that was in 1971, 1972. Very bitter strike. It polarized the Mexican American community and the Anglo community.Frank Sanchez:	What we ran up there against was again when we went with the decision making with the city council could resolve this, it was all Anglo, and we just couldn't reach any negotiation. I believe later on, fast-forward 20 years later, that was one of the first human rights lawsuits that we filed after the state legislature and we challenged the city council, and the school board, and the county commission. I always tell this story is that they took the most advantages because they understood that struggle that happened 20 years before and how they were shut out of the political process. On the first round of elections, there was eight city council. They elected for the first time ever four Latinos to the city council. Eventually, one of those city council persons that were elected by the Latino community became mayor, the very first mayor of Artesia.Jose Armas:	Who was that?Frank Sanchez:	Danny Reyes, and he's still a magistrate judge. He actually, which is the irony of this, is he succeeded the mayor, Mayor Ernest Thompson, that led the bitter resistance against the strike. So he succeeded that mayor and was the first Latino mayor of Artesia. But to me, it all goes back to understanding the historical context and their struggle for equality in that town.Jose Armas:	We don't have too much time left, Frank, but I wanted you to talk, have you say a few words about your philosophy for empowering communities. What has been your approach? I mean, you've been involved in this for 40 years and you've not wavered, you've not changed the course of your life activities, and you're driven obviously by trying to empower disenfranchised communities, and what do you apply and what is a part of your formula for [00:35:00] successful empowerment?Frank Sanchez:	Part of it is just how I grew up and seeing the obstacles that my family faced, and being shut out of the political process, as well as low-wage jobs, all those things had an impact on me. I think my philosophy is I am and I always will be a community organizer, even though I work with philanthropy now with the foundation. Basically, the philosophy with community organizers is that, it's we did it, it's not I did it, and it's all about people that are involved and you never do for others that they can do for themselves, that it's important for the persons that are being affected by the issues, change their community, shape their destiny. That's always been important.Jose Armas:	How do you push that though? Because that's such a general statement. How do you get communities to take ownership or take responsibility to do for themselves?Frank Sanchez:	Well, I think part of it is that you hold people accountable for doing what they need to do for their communities. You don't do it for them because people still come and says, ""Well, can you take care of this problem?"" I say, ""Well, how can we take care of it? What are the strategies we can use to make improvements?"" The other thing I found is that in organizing, you can't take every problem. You try to find common problems and you develop it into an issue. The other thing that's important for me has always been is you've got to give people confidence that sometimes you can't take on the big issues until you win some small issues. It's all a matter of building up people's confidence so that they can take on something bigger and feel the confidence that they can change their situation.Jose Armas:	Given today's climate in which our community finds itself, where do you see our community at in terms of trying to gain empowerment and trying to gain a position in improving the lives for their children and in our own community at the present time? What do you see happening in today's climate?Frank Sanchez:	Yeah. Well, I see a lot of it and I'm very privileged because I work for a foundation and we fund community organizations all over, we'll just say the Southwest, and I see incredible leaders. First of all, it's about leaders, incredible leaders that will have the courage, and have the ability, and the capacity, and the training to be able to take on large powers. Still, the issues are the same. It's incredible to me, 40 years, the issues are education, healthcare, jobs, and now the most preeminent issue is immigration and immigrant rights. It's just a matter of organizing and having the right strategies in the organizing, and building trust among community leaders. That's really, really critical, which is tough. So there's just a lot of different ways to do that. I think individual meetings, house meetings, community meetings, are a way to do that. You got to have action. If communities don't have actions to publicly state what they want, it usually doesn't happen.Jose Armas:	Well, we've been talking heavy about your career activities, tell me a little bit about Frank the family man. Where are you now in terms of a family? Where is your family? After 40 years, is that something that--Frank Sanchez:	Well, it's important. That's what's driven me and I've had a family that's been very supportive too. We're 14th generation New-Mexicans, and people ask me where are you from, well, that's all I know. I'm married to a beautiful, wonderful woman now for 35 years, Hilda, and she has been an educator. She recently retired after 31 years in education, devoted to her students, devoted to education in her community. Have two children and three grandchildren. Right now, if you want to bring a smile to my face is get me talking about my grandchildren.Jose Armas:	Well, and the other which I heard you mention once before is that you have a son who is very much into golf, right?Frank Sanchez:	Right.Jose Armas:	Again, coming from where you were 40 years ago, tell me what you're going to be doing with your [00:40:00] son here pretty quick.Frank Sanchez:	If you were to ask me 40 years ago that I would be going to the United States Open, actually, one of the most Anglo sports, I would have said I won't be there. But my son, he was involved in sports, in basketball in high school, and baseball. Actually, just as a side note, my son was the assistant coach of the Roswell High School that won the state basketball championship this year for the second year in a row.Jose Armas:	Great.Frank Sanchez:	So there's a lot of things that I pursue outside of my work. Family's really, really critical to me.Jose Armas:	It's central to it.Frank Sanchez:	Central to everything I do.Jose Armas:	Okay. All right. Well, Frank, I appreciate this opportunity to get a chance to visit with you. We haven't talked at this kind of length in many years. Thank you very muchFrank Sanchez:	I want to thank you, Jose, and appreciate all the mentoring that you did with us in those early days when we were starting out the Chicano Youth Association. We'll always appreciate that.Jose Armas:	Okay.Frank Sanchez:	Thank you.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
MBY006607,"Henry:	My name is Henry Real. I am 40 years old. Today's date is June 11th, 2010. We're in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm interviewing my good friend, Joseph.Joseph:	My name is Joseph John Alfaro. I am 31 years old. Today's date is June 11th, 2010. We're here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm interviewing with Henry Real, one of my best friend.Henry:	I was thinking we just start talking a little bit about where you're from. Where were you born?Joseph:	Here in Albuquerque.Henry:	Did you grow up here also?Joseph:	My whole life.Henry:	In Albuquerque, the city itself?Joseph:	Yes.Henry:	So what was it like growing up here?Joseph:	Growing up was, when you asked me when I was growing up, what I really remember, the big picture is going back and forth from my mom to my dad.Henry:	Where did they live?Joseph:	My mom was on the west side and my dad was here in the South Valley. But they were divorced so I would go back and forth, and that's something that I remember.Henry:	Yeah. That was a big piece of what you remember. How often did you go back? Was is everyday or once a week?Joseph:	It was every week, just a continuous back and forth.Henry:	What was your parents' names?Joseph:	My mom is Norma Alfaro. Her maiden name was Chavez. My dad is John Alfaro.Henry:	Where were they from? Do you know?Joseph:	My mom was from the North Valley and my dad was from here, and in the East Mountains.Henry:	So you're near [inaudible 00:01:59] , or where was that?Joseph:	Tijeras.Henry:	Yeah.Joseph:	They did a lot of growing up there.Henry:	Do you have siblings?Joseph:	I have a daughter. She's 13, Amber Alfaro. Then I've got a brand new one, Elijah Alfaro. He was born on June 2nd. So he's fairly new.Henry:	Nine, 10 days old?Joseph:	Yeah.Henry:	What about brothers and sisters?Joseph:	I have a sister, Yvette Chavez. That's it. She's older than me. She's 39.Henry:	What was it like? What was she like when you're growing up with her? Were you guys close?Joseph:	Well, we had different dads, same mom, but she was like everything was the same. We're pretty close. There was that age difference where she did different things than I did, but she always watched after me.Henry:	Going back to your your little hijito, this was relatively recent that he was born. So what was that experience like participating in the birth? What was that all like?Joseph:	It was awesome. It happened so fast. Just bonding with him while he was in Natalie, when he came out it was priceless.Henry:	What were you feeling? Do you remember?Joseph:	I was just happy that I made this. Now, today, I've seen him. He was just looking right at me and just, god. I was just feeling great, just happy, and happy to share all the things that I do.Henry:	I know it's still early, but do you have any idea of things that you want for him? I know that I have ideas for my kids of what I would like for them. You know what I mean?Joseph:	Yeah. Well, I want him to have a good life, go to school, not to struggle, and just to have a good education. Basically, it's what it boils down to, to have a good education. I want to share everything that I know with him, and experience everything like fishing, camping, hunting, these things that most kids don't get to experience.Henry:	Did you do a lot of that stuff when you were growing up?Joseph:	My dad did a lot of fishing and camping with me, but not to the hunting part. He didn't really believe in killing the animals at all. It was never, nothing. Then when he got sick, then all that stopped.Henry:	When did he gets sick?Joseph:	It's been about six years now when he got sick. But even a little bit before that, we stopped going camping. I was growing up. I started a family early. My time went in another direction than with my dad. So my dad was kind of hurt because he didn't have me as his little hijito anymore. He was kind of sad about that.Henry:	Your daughter, she's not around as much as the little guy is. Do you have thoughts about her?Joseph:	All the time. Almost every day.Henry:	Back in your childhood, when you think about Elijah and what's coming up for him, you think about your own childhood, what would you like different for him than what you had for yourself?Joseph:	Just good upbringing, the family together, mom, dad. I wouldn't want him to be back and forth like I was.Henry:	Yeah. When you were growing up, I want you to think of one memory of something that you really enjoyed doing when you were a little kid. One memory that you have that was a great day, a perfect day growing up when you were a kid.Joseph:	This one time in the mountains, we had a gathering of friends and family. Everyone brought their tents, trailers. They all got around in a circle and set up camp like that. So there was probably 15 families, and it had fire barbecue. I was a kid and I would mingle with all kinds of other little kids and stuff. That was a good memory.Henry:	Out in the land out there that your dad has?Joseph:	Yeah.Henry:	What about here in the Valley when you were growing up here? What did you do in the summer when you weren't in school? Did you have particular kids that were your friends? Who were some of your friends that you hung out with when you were a kid here in Athesco?Joseph:	Well, I had different sides of friends. I had the friends that were around where my mom lived, and then I had the friends that were here in the valley where my dad lived. So I would go back and forth like that. Some friends I don't see anymore, some friends I still do. But a memory from that time would be, we would make these little clubhouses in the mesa, where my mom lived on the west side. We'd dig these tunnels and cover them, make little stashes, make little fires in there. We would roll up tobacco and be smoking cigarettes when we're not supposed to, stuff like that. I always remember doing things like that.Henry:	Who are some of the names? What are some of the names of your friend, even if you just remember their first name.Joseph:	DJ Lopez, Daniel Martinez, Adam Martinez, Paul Arcilla, Randy Castillo, Joe Dabney. Those are all some buddies that lived around there. Lewis Basera.Henry:	Those are the ones near your mom's?Joseph:	Yeah.Henry:	And the ones near your dad's?Joseph:	Daniel Chavez. Well, he's no longer with us anymore. Steve Chavez, he's still around. Leo Chavez. They're still around. I don't really see them often. I don't have their direct number and I can call them. David Chavez, I can see him. He's like a brother, I see him all the time, talk to him every other day. It's like that.Henry:	What kind of trouble did you guys get into when you were kids? Did you ever do anything to get in trouble?Joseph:	We love to break windows. I remember, we used to always throw rocks at this one particular house when we would walk home from John Adams. This one day, I don't know what we were thinking, we decided to throw another rock, and then these three big guys jumped over the fence and they were chasing us. But I didn't know they were chasing us. My friends started running. I was like, ""What the? Where are they going?"" Then I just got clobbered. I was in middle school and these guys were maybe high school or older, and they just rumbled me up pretty good. So that was a hard lesson to learn. That was a good lesson. Yeah.Henry:	I guess that's no more throwing rocks and breaking windows.Joseph:	Yeah. Now we've got BB guns, so you do it from a distance.Henry:	Sniper. Who are your relatives that you feel you're closest with, either cousins, or uncles, or aunts?Joseph:	Well, on my mom's side, my auntie, Patricia, and I haven't seen her about 10 years, but I've seen her today.Henry:	What was that like?Joseph:	It was like, what do I tell her? How does she feel about me? Or I wonder what she's thinking. I wonder if she has a lot on her mind, because her and my mom don't get along. Ever since my grandma died, they just got into a fight, just the way things shouldn't have went, they went that way. So I don't really know and I don't want to have to be in a position where I have to choose sides because she was one of my favorite aunties.Henry:	Do you have any memories of her, specific thing that she did, either a certain day or something?Joseph:	Well, for my birthday, she always made it special. I remember one time she bought me these birds. The whole deal, she bought me the cage, the bird, everything.Henry:	She was always there for your birthdays? Did she recognize you when you walked in this morning?Joseph:	Well, I had this appointment for a few weeks, but I've been getting so busy, and it's like I've had to cancel it. My dad got in a hospital, Elijah was born, I was going crazy. So I had to cancel this appointment, and I was on her roster all those times and she's like, ""I'm going to see him,"" and I just didn't show up.FEMALE_1:	What was this appointment for?Joseph:	It was to get some health insurance, and I had to provide my birth certificate, Social Security card, and then my income, and then they go around that and give me some kind of a benefit of it.FEMALE_1:	Your aunt just works there?Joseph:	She works for U&M and she does that processing. But I went through a clinic, totally on the other side of town called First Choice, it's on the west side, Gonzales and [inaudible 00:13:52].FEMALE_1:	So you're going to see her and it was just going to be by chance?Joseph:	I was just fate, I guess.Henry:	So you had no idea that she was going to be sitting there when you walked in to fill up those paper work, now at this morning? Did you recognize her immediately?Joseph:	Well, of course. Of course.Henry:	Do you have so much going on in your life right now? It's really just observing you and what you're doing with your life right now, it's really inspiring to me. Now, you have a brand new baby, your dad is sick, and you step in whenever that's needed. All of this agriculture program that we've been working on in the community, you've just totally taken that. If you take a few minutes just to reflect and think about where you are in your life right now, I mean, how do you feel, or what do you think about?Joseph:	Where I'm at, well, I have a clear mind and I have a sense of direction where I want to go and where I want to be, and I want to be with my family. I want to go forward, not backwards. I've gotten myself in trouble in the past, which I carry that on my shoulders today, and I see all the benefits in life, which if you're not looking for it, you probably won't see it, but I see it now.Henry:	It's beautiful. Are there any moments that you can think of in your life where that you'd think back and that you feel really proud of, that you think back of that was something that I did, that I was really proud of myself or things like that?Joseph:	I'm proud that I'm doing the things that I'm doing today, and moving forward, and not dwelling on the past or what could have been, and trying to control things that cannot be controlled. I'm proud that I'm there to support my dad and his health, and I'm proud that Elijah is there to be with me, to grow up with me, and I'm also proud to have good friends like you.Henry:	I'm very proud to have you as a friend. I think of you as being like a very old soul. Your idea of when life is good, I imagine you as a grandpa with grandchildren all around you. You what I mean? That's the road that you're trying to get to, and it's like when you're a grandpa, and you have all these grand kids around, and they ask you, and they look at you, I mean, what do you want? What would you like them to like, when they look back at your life and what you've accomplished in your life, other than having grand kids and having a house and stuff like that, what would you like them to see? What would you like to be remembered for? I mean, you're only in the middle of your life, early part of your life, but if you were to think about, if I'm on the road that I want to be in, and I'm a grandpa, and I'm old, what would you think that would be satisfying that your life had been?Joseph:	I'd them to think that I came a long the way and that there is hope to change the things the road that you put it on, you know what I mean? So it's up to you, what do you want? Because you can do it, you can do anything you want. If you really want it, you'll do it.Henry:	What do you want?Joseph:	I want to be happy. I want my health to be good, and I want friends' and family. There's good friends and then there's bad friends. When you get older, you start knowing. People always said, when I was a kid, ""I wish I was still a kid."" I'm like, ""Why? I wish I was old."" Now that I'm older, I say I wish I was a kid because you have no worries really. You don't have to worry about bills, you don't have to worry about what road you're on and who's driving that bus on that road. But if you just grab yourself and get a hold of yourself and think, what am I doing? Where do I want to be? How am I going to get there? This is the steps I got to do. You can do it. You can do anything if you want it.Henry:	Yeah.Joseph:	I don't know if that answered your question.Henry:	Yeah. There's no right or wrong answer. Well, let me see here. Let me ask you; you've been alive for 31 years, lived in the Valley. What changed about your community in the time that you can remember? You can talk about either the West side or you can talk about the Valley or both or whatever.Joseph:	What's changed in the area?Henry:	Yeah. Do you feel like the area that you live now is pretty much the same as it's always been or do you feel like it's changed?Joseph:	I see different parts that have changed and that are the same. You see a lot of drugs out there, but that's everywhere. But now that I'm older, I see that, when you're a kid, you really either don't know about that or don't see it, in which that's a good thing. When you get older, you start seeing those things more and more and you just know that's bad or see the same people on the street. I noticed that that's gotten real bad. People panhandling, people burning people for whatever, drugs is controlling at all. The things that are the same is when I pull up to the house, everything's just seems the same all the time. There may be some things are different, like now my dad is in a hospital, you know what I mean? I see his car there and everything, but he's not home. That's hard because it's the same thing coming home, seeing his car there, but he's not there. That's different.Henry:	When is he coming back?Joseph:	Hopefully tomorrow. He had treatment, his dialysis today, and they had to stop a little bit early because his heart rate was real high and his blood pressure was real low or something. So they had to stop it, and then they're going to have to redo it tomorrow for what reason, he's been doing so well. But then it's like, well, my grandpa went into the hospital, he had been healthy, went to the hospital, he never came back home. He died in the hospital. I think that has engraved something in my dad's mind to not get help when you know that your body needs help. He says no, maybe he's scarred from that memory of, if I go to the hospital I might not come back home, and I really think that he thinks like that. Because if it's not one thing they start finding more things, and I think that's why I say it's very important your health now. Not when you already, oh, my liver hurts or I need to stop smoking cigarettes, or you can do all those things. I think it's just fate.Henry:	What about Natalie, your girlfriend, mother of your little 'jito. So how did you guys meet?Joseph:	We met through a friend. It was through a friend, Johnny. He lives in the area. There's this other girl, Stephanie, that lives across the street from him and she was her friend. He's like, ""Oh, you might like my friend,"" so he called me up, and I went down there and we were drinking and just having a good time and just one thing led to another. We started to get real close. Then I got incarcerated for a little while and I was like, oh, man, just when things are starting to get serious with this girl. For some reason, she was all I could think about. Then when I got out, then we were together and we've been together, it's been like 16 months.Henry:	So you worked for a long time at Nelson's Meats, everybody knows where that place is. It's a standard butcher shop on the West side end in the Valley. So how long did you work there?Joseph:	I worked there about 14 years.Henry:	What stuff did you do there?Joseph:	I first started out there when I was 13 years old. My dad knew Larry Nelson and was like, ""Can give my son a job?"" He said, ""Yeah.""  I went in there, I started working, I was helping customers, I was doing deliveries, and I was only 13 years old. I don't think I had my license, I got my license when I was 15. So I would do deliveries without a license, I'd just drive down the street. They were just little small things. It seems like back then you were able to do things like that, you didn't really worry about them. I don't really remember, but I think I even told them I had my license or something and they said, ""Oh, yeah."" It was real funny. It's taught me a lot.Henry:	What did it teach you?Joseph:	To be responsible, to do everything that you can do, make things look good, don't be late, and late is 10 minutes early. That's still late. So just always be on time, and just the values in life, too.Henry:	Was he a pretty good businessman?Joseph:	Of course, he said Tommy, they used to go pass out flyers, walk six miles or 10 miles with books and flyers in the snow, him and his brother did that. But how true that is, I don't know.Henry:	Well, it's a good business, it has been there a long time.Joseph:	Yeah. Very successful.Henry:	So what else did you do there?Joseph:	Then as I got older, I was still going to high school and going to work, I did that and then I went and got another job. There was a period where I was out, I was there probably like four years, then I got another job just because I needed benefits. I wanted some benefits and all that. I know benefits, and he would tell us this is just a stepping stone. I'm like, okay. So I went somewhere else, but then I still work there. Soon as I got out of that place after I'd go back and help clean up. Well, I learned to cut meat there, I learned to process meat, and there was carcass beef. That's the best stuff you can get. When you work somewhere else you think you can either grade them, this places isn't good, it's not that great. Yeah, it was actually very good stuff, 100 percent.Henry:	Yeah. Did you make friends there when your were working there?Joseph:	Yeah.Henry:	Long-term friends?Joseph:	Long-term friends. I have a bunch of friends that I still see today that still work there. We might not hang out, but I still consider them my friends. They're pretty good friends. They'll have a good head on their shoulders. Maybe we all have issues, we all fall. But if there's someone there to help you get back up, and it's good.Henry:	What are you doing nowadays? Work wise?Joseph:	Work. Well, I'm in a agriculture program funded from the USDA. Basically, it gives us the infrastructure to be sustainable. We grow produce for APS, farmers markets, co-ops, and for our community. We get people to go down and help out and they can take some produce. I always like to influence someone to try something different. They might not even like it or not even know about it because there's things that I didn't know about that I loved, like Swiss chard. That stuff is good and it's right there, at home. So we sell to farmers markets and we hope to step up some notches throughout the years.Henry:	So there's all these different aspects of things that you do. You're driving tractors, you're selling, there's all these things. If you are to pick one thing that you like the most that you do in this stuff that you're doing today, what is it?Joseph:	I think helping people or working with people, that's what I like to do the most. Teach people. That's what I'd like to do. Just work with people. But don't get me wrong, I like to work with the people doing the agriculture program, teaching them, showing them if maybe they're in a wrong direction or having a bad day. Just some words of wisdom, encouragement. It's always good.FEMALE_1:	Who is doing the agriculture program, or who is participating? What people are you working with when you are working in the program?Joseph:	We work with Don Bustos. He's a farmer, he's done it all his life out of Espanola Santa Cruz Farm. He's one of the main guys that without him, he's a model that's shown that this is possible to generate a certain amount of revenue per year, like maybe 100,000, depending on how much land you have cultivated and produce. The way it works is we got two other individuals and myself, and they're part of other organizations like La Plazita and emerging communities. Then there's me, with Valle Encantado. We came together as one. We collaborated to one and we go off of Agri-Cultura network. So we're trying to fulfill a certain demand for like APS, you just think about it like a bunch of ants, a whole bunch of ants is stronger than this one ant. You know those ants are pretty strong, aren't they?FEMALE_1:	Joseph, earlier you were talking about how these days you're seeing a lot of life's benefits and possibilities. Has something changed recently? It sounds almost like your life perspective has changed. Is that true?Joseph:	Yeah. I was heading in the wrong direction. I was just hanging around the wrong people. Those wrong people, there's that good and bad, it's like you have that thing on shoulder, ""Do this, do that. "" Then you have the good person, ""No, do this.""  It's either one of those is going to win and you're going to decide which one it is. All the time that I was with the bad guy, ""Oh yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that."" Well, I've made that transition, I'm moving forward. There's this little chunk of my life where I was just on pause, and you move nowhere, I was just there. Before you know it, your life will just pass, before you know, you could have done this, you could have done that. Now I have a little boy to move forward with.FEMALE_1:	What happened for you. Was there a moment? What do you think changed your thinking?Joseph:	What changed my thinking? It's, well, you want to be successful or do you want to spend the rest of your life in jail or prison, and that's not what I want. It took that fire to burn me that good, where it left burn marks on me. So I stay away from the fire. I just want to do the things that are right.Henry:	In the time that I've known you, I've just seen amazing growth. I just look forward to being friends with you for long time. It's just exciting to me to see where are you going to be 20 years from now. I look forward to that.Joseph:	Where am I going to be? You could actually decide that now and be there. For now, I'm just taking it day by day.Henry:	All right.FEMALE_1:	Henry, if someone will listen to this recording in 20 years or something. How would you describe Joseph to someone who doesn't know him?Henry:	I would say Joseph is extremely talented a person. He has the heart of a lion and I feel like he's always just needed an opportunity and some encouragement. He's a good man. That's what I would boil it down to. I don't put those words out lightly, because he cares and he works hard, he's conscientious. If I was going to go into battle, I can't think of anybody else I'd rather have with me in battle. I trust him completely. I love him very much, my compadre.Joseph:	Thank you. I love you too bro.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
MBY006610,"Eloise Serna:	[00:00:00] My name is Eloise Serna. I am 65 years old. Today's date is June 11, 2010. We are in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am here with my husband Patricio and our daughter, Anna.Anna Alicia Serna:	My name is Anna Alicia Serna. I'm 26 years old. Today is June 11, 2010. We are in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am here with my mom and my dad.Patricio Serna:	My name is Patricio Serna. I'm 71 years old. We're here today on June 11, 2010 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I'm here with my wife and my daughter.Anna Alicia Serna:	I couldn't think of a better place to be conducting this interview, except at the National Hispanic Cultural Center, which is a great resource for not only Hispanics, but also everybody. It's very informative about cultures and arts, and it's a great place. I'm very happy to be here. I'm going to tell you a little about myself. As I said I'm Anna Alicia Serna. I was born and raised in Santa Fe to my parents Patricio Serna and Eloise Serna. I have lived in Albuquerque for eight years now. I graduated at the University of New Mexico with a degree in Cultural and Linguistic Anthropology and Chicano Studies, and I just got a job at an elementary school where I will be starting to teach in a first, second, and third grade class. That's about me, and we're going to hear a little bit about my mom and then we'll start this conversation and get it flowing. Mom.Eloise Serna:	My name is Eloise A. Serna, born Eloisa Adeltias Armijo in 1944 to Juan Gilberto Armijo and Antonia [inaudible 00:01:52] in Pecos, New Mexico. There were six children, five girls, one boy. I was the fourth child. We lived in the country. We farmed, we planted, we had animals and we hulled our own water from the river as youngsters, but later on had running water. We were all expected to help. We worked hard. Our parents worked hard. My father was a laborer at a nearby ranch and actually also my father and mother when they were first married, worked at a Guest Ranch in Cowles, New Mexico near Pecos. They worked at the Guest Ranch, and at this Guest Ranch, one of the most celebrated or one of the guests included the Oppenheimers from Los Alamos, New Mexico. My mother spoke often about those times, and that's one story that I really wish had been recorded. That's the reason why I believe that this preservation of history is so important that we're doing today.Eloise Serna:	We all went to the local elementary school, and we went to school not knowing English. It was against the rules to speak Spanish so we immediately learned English. We learned it really fast. Our clothes were ordered from the Montgomery Ward's catalog for Easter and Christmas. The rest was pretty much given to us by relatives or friends, although we always had plenty to eat. Our parents were very strict and they were very strong Catholics. They expected us for Lent to do the penance and to pray Rosaries every night during Lent. We all went, after high school -- I'm going to go back a little bit. I went to college for two years. Girls were not encouraged to go to college. Even in high school, we never saw or spoke to counselors about college. After going to school for two years, I got a job with the state government and worked there until my retirement.Eloise Serna:	I met Patricio in 1979 and we were married in 1981. We have one son, John, 42, two daughters Elena, 28, an attorney in Texas, Anna, 26, starting her teaching career. We have one granddaughter, Grace, who is going to be five, and is the daughter of John. Anna is here today conducting this interview and she's going to take over and talk to Dad.Anna Alicia Serna:	Okay. Thanks for that mom, that was a nice summary. I know there's a lot more in-betweens that we might even touch on some of that. I actually learned some stuff I didn't know so that verifies how important this process is. Daddy, [00:05:00] do want to tell us some childhood memories, tell us about growing up?Patricio Serna:	Of course, I'd be happy to, Anna. My mother passed away when she was 37 years old. My dad was left with eight children, six girls and two boys. I was not quite two years old and my youngest sister Rosalie was only seven months. My dad, Pablo Serna, a kind, caring, wonderful person never remarried and devoted his life to caring for his family. He was a laborer, and I recall that my very, very best Christmas ever was when I was about five years old, and we had a little tree about a foot tall with two balls on it, few icicles. Rosalie and I, that Christmas got a roll of lifesavers each. My roll lasted me almost four months because I would break each lifesaver into four pieces and I would savor each piece. It was so wonderful. The reason that that was my very best Christmas, is because all the family was together. To me, the most important thing in life is family togetherness, family unity, family love, and that Christmas, we had it, and that's why that's my very, very best Christmas.Patricio Serna:	I recall when I was about six or seven, we built our own log house. We cut the pine trees down, we pruned them, and we built a three-bedroom house. We had no electricity, no running water. Actually, we didn't get inside plumbing till after I graduated from college. But what I remember about growing up was that the family was so unified and we had so much love from my father, Pablo Serna. Then my grandmother stayed with us too. My sister and I we used came home from school and she'd cook for us. Of course the normal meal was beans and chili, and tortillas.Patricio Serna:	We're talking about quite a few years ago. In school we were in one room, both my sister and I and about four, five grades in the elementary school. The town was called Reserve, New Mexico, and its a small town in the Southwestern part of New Mexico in the mountains, Gila National Forest. Everybody was in the same shape, everybody was poor. We had a little garden, we had a few chickens and so forth. But in looking back, I remember that we had an assignment to say what we ate that week, and so my sister Rosalie and I coordinated and we put, ""Oh, we had spaghetti, we had bread, we had bananas, we had pancakes, and so forth,"" and frankly, all we had was beans and chili and homemade tortillas. Today that's my favorite food. But in a way, in those days, you were ashamed of your culture.Patricio Serna:	When I started school, although I could trace my ancestry back 14 generations, I did not know a word of English, and they would hit us with a long ruler if we spoke English, so I learned -- if we spoke Spanish, so I learned English very, very, very fast. I remember those young days, but they were good days.Patricio Serna:	As I grew a little older, my oldest sister Isabel that was 15 years when my mother passed away, was a voracious reader and she had me reading books such as Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, ""The Power of Positive Thinking,"" Dr. Napoleon Hill, ""From each adversity, you gain an equivalent or a greater benefit."" She used to tell me, ""Pat, picture yourself where [00:10:00] you want to be and don't worry about how you're going to get there. Always, always number one, be positively focused, be determined, and number three, very important, believe in yourself."" That in a way has been my guiding light, my beacon, my philosophy of life. I got to college by a fluke because nobody in those days went to college from Reserve or from my family, nobody had ever gone.Patricio Serna:	But the local priest Father Bob Kirsch, he asked me, ""Pat, are you going to go to college?"" I said, ""No, Father Bob, I'm not."" I had received offers from the state universities because I was head of the class and I was class president, and I had straight As. He said, ""Come with me."" So we went uptown to the local public phone and he called the President of the College of St. Joseph on the Rio Grande, and I can to this day, hear him. He said, ""Sister Viatora, I have this young man here with me, we're in Reserve, New Mexico. His name is Pat Serna and he's got straight A's, he's head of the class, he's class president. Sister, I was wondering if you could give him a scholarship to St. Joseph."" She said, ""Father Bob, this is what we can do for Pat. We can give him a scholarship for half tuition and a job for the other half. He will have to maintain a high grade point average."" Father Bob said, ""He'll be there, Sister."" So I was flabbergasted, but that's how I got to college.Patricio Serna:	Then when I got there, that was in Albuquerque, they had no dormitory. So I and four other young Hispanic men from small towns throughout New Mexico, we lived in the boiler room, we each had a cot. But we loved it, we ate good, we cleaned the school inside and out. For five summers, I fought forest fires on the Gila National Forest, and my dad, pobrecito, he was working along with me, fighting forest fires, and he worked harder than anyone else. But we worked together and we'd be up in the mountains all summer. I was drafted right out of college. I got the mail truck from Reserve to Silver City, 100 miles away. Of course, we helped the mailman along the way, put the mail in all the mailboxes and we stopped halfway there in [inaudible 00:12:59] . My first cousin, Wilson Kelly, joined us and we got to Silver City and then we got on a Trailway's bus.  We'd never been on a bus before. Of course, this was after college, and then we got to El Paso. Lo and behold, we got on a train, we'd never been on a train before. Went to Fort Polk, Louisiana, where we had basic training. Then I was stationed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts for my two years and he was in the state of Washington. Do you have another question or do you want me to continue, because I just moving along?Anna Alicia Serna:	Yeah, I didn't want to interrupt. I had a lot of stuff to mention, but I didn't want to interrupt.Patricio Serna:	Okay.Anna Alicia Serna:	We're going to have to backtrack.Patricio Serna:	Yes.Anna Alicia Serna:	So, you had the support of your family, and of course, you had high expectations in yourself, what did you think other people expected of you? Or did they really expect anything, being that you were from a small town, it was long time ago?Patricio Serna:	Well, in those days, nobody went to college and I'm sure nobody expected that I would go. Had it not been for Father Bob, I wouldn't have gone. Because later on in life, I don't want to get too far ahead, but they told me that there were a lot of jobs there at the sawmill and so forth. But that's a story unto itself.Anna Alicia Serna:	So essentially, if he didn't believe in you and then you probably wouldn't have gone to do what you were meant to do?Patricio Serna:	Had he not done that for me, I would have stayed in Reserve, continued working for the Forest Service, and working at the saw mill. Because a lot of my friends, they're still there and even at this age, they're still logging.Anna Alicia Serna:	What else did I want to say? So, after [00:15:00] college, you were in the military. Were you always interested in pursuing law school?Patricio Serna:	No, because I had never been introduced or seen an attorney. But after the military, I was a probation parole officer and when I'd go to court, the first time I had seen attorneys. I did pre-sentence reports when someone was convicted of a crime. The judge would ask the attorney, ""What do you have to say on behalf of your client, the defendant?"" The attorneys would say, ""Your Honor, I have nothing to add to the pre-sentence report."" So I started thinking, ""My gosh, I'm doing all the work and they're making all the money."" Because as a probation parole officer, I only made $375 a month. So then in my mind, I started picturing myself as a lawyer. There was this program funded by Ford Foundation at the University of Denver, because in those days, there were no Hispanic attorneys in the Southwest, maybe one or two, but they were from elite families and it was taken for granted that they'd got to law school. But not people from my category of life; humble, poor, and so forth.Patricio Serna:	But the University of Denver had this program and they had a summer program. So I went -- 20 of us went, and 11 of us made it. We were given a full fellowship, with all expenses paid, tuition, books, and even a living stipend. Then I also had my GI Bill. So I got into law school and I did very well. I was the first Hispanic on the law review. Then I taught in the summer programs for other Hispanics that were trying out for that summer program. Actually, I did so well that I was offered a fellowship at Harvard Law School for a Masters of Law. So I went home and I told daddy about it. Poor daddy, he had never heard of Harvard. He asked me where it was and I told him and he said, ""Pero, mijo, esta tan lejos. Son, it's so far. Ya que tenemos trabajo en la  [inaudible 00:17:25] . We have jobs here at the saw mill."" Then I said, "" Pero, papa, es la mejor escuela de leyes en el mundo."" I said, ""Dad it's the best law school in the world, I'd like to go."" He said, ""Bueno, hijo. Que Dios te ayude y bendiga. May God help you son,"" so I went.Patricio Serna:	It's a two-year program. Your first year you take your courses, advanced law courses, and your second year you write your thesis. But I did everything in one year. I knew I wasn't going to sleep much, so I took my courses from noon on and then I would work on my thesis till three o'clock in the morning. So I finished it in one year and I needed to have a high B plus average, and I maintained it. Then at the College of Saint Joseph on the Rio Grande, I kept that scholarship for four years too, I almost had a perfect score at the end. But that's how I got to law school. But I had pictured myself as an attorney, and I didn't worry how I was going to get there and what my sister told me happened. I became an attorney. Any other questions?Anna Alicia Serna:	You mentioned Spanish is your first language as well as its yours, mom. Being that you did get punished for speaking Spanish, and you mentioned it made you ashamed, do you feel that this experience made you hesitant to teach Elena and I Spanish?Patricio Serna:	No. My dream has been, since the day you were born, that you would be bilingual, because I've been so concerned that the new generations coming up, they are not continuing the tradition of speaking Spanish. I'm so proud that both you and Elena on your own have learned it.Anna Alicia Serna:	That's what my question was. You and mom didn't personally teach us to speak, we did learn on our own. So in a way, don't you think you would have taught us from birth?Patricio Serna:	That's one of my biggest regrets.Anna Alicia Serna:	[00:20:00] So I think that shame was.Patricio Serna:	Oh, yes. No, that's one of my biggest regrets in life that we didn't teach you Spanish from early on.Anna Alicia Serna:	But we still learned.Patricio Serna:	But one of my greatest joys was that in spite of us neglecting to do that, you did it anyway and that makes us so, so proud.Anna Alicia Serna:	Well, I think that also just shows how much has changed over the years from when you were children where diversity wasn't really appreciated and respected, whereas now, people do take pride and joy in their culture. So, you did teach me that, which is why I learned Spanish.Patricio Serna:	That's good.Eloise Serna:	That's right.Anna Alicia Serna:	We will definitely keep that traditional life.Patricio Serna:	Definitely.Eloise Serna:	For sure.Anna Alicia Serna:	Okay. So, you became a lawyer, which seems like you achieved every dream possible, but you had higher goals.Patricio Serna:	Yes.Anna Alicia Serna:	Tell us what led up to you becoming a judge.Patricio Serna:	Well, in the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to be a judge, but I knew I was not ready for it. So after Harvard, I spent four years in Washington D.C. working for Ambassador Raymond Telles who's turning 95 now on September 6. He was first Hispanic mayor of El Paso and then Ambassador to Costa Rica seven years under Kennedy, and then commissioner of the EEOC and I was his assistant.Patricio Serna:	While in Washington, I also taught at two law schools, Catholic University School of Law and Georgetown University School of Law, advanced constitutional litigation. Then when I returned to New Mexico, I came back as a Deputy Attorney General under Toney Anaya, Hispanic attorney general. The day came when I was ready to be a judge, and by then, Anaya was governor. So I called him and he appointed me district court judge. When I got to be a district court judge, I was picturing myself on the Supreme Court but I knew I wasn't ready and I enjoyed being a district court judge very much and handle some big cases in Georgia O'Keeffe case and other cases. F. Lee Bailey came to defend someone did a good job, but in the back my mind, I was picturing myself in the Supreme Court and the day came when I was ready. After 11 and a half years as a district judge, I was ready for the Supreme Court. I had been a criminal trial judge, civil, family, children's court. I was ready and an opening came up and I ran for the position statewide, put 60,000 miles on our older model car. I won and I became justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court. Once I got there, I pictured myself as chief justice, but I knew I wasn't ready. I was elected in 1996. In 2001, I became chief justice. Ambassador Telles came and spoke at my swearing in as chief justice and all my family was there. They were very, very proud. That was my life's dream, but incrementally, it came. Just like Isabelle had told me, picture yourself there. Don't worry how you're going to get there, but always be positively focused, determined, and always believe in yourself and you will achieve it. So I'm proud to say that for someone like me with no heritage of, well, for social position to have gone to college, law school, been a lawyer, district judge, justice, chief justice, and now senior justice on the New Mexico Supreme Court. I've been there 14 years. That means that the American dream is alive and available for us, for our children and our grandchildren, and that is what I always say to young people. I address young people at all levels, high school, even elementary, law students, and that's a message I give. I always conclude by saying, ""If a poor country boy from reserve can make it as chief justice, [00:25:00] think of what you can do, only if you stay positively focused, determined, and believe in yourself. You will do it."" That, in a nutshell is my life story. But I think that the best thing in my life is a wonderful family that I have and the love that we share and the togetherness that we have. You know, we talked to you every day, we talk to Helena every day, we talk to John every day, and our granddaughter Gracie. We get pictures of her every day. It's been said that family is a gem of civilization. It's been said that if you are in harmony with your family, that's success. We have that harmony, we have that love, we have that unity and togetherness, so we're a successful family.Anna Alicia Serna:	That is amazing. That was very inspiring. Your story, it just amazes me every time I hear it. So I thank you for that. I'm going to ask you some more questions.Patricio Serna:	Sure.Anna Alicia Serna:	Of all your achievements, you did mention family was the most important and along that comes faith. How has your faith kept you strong during your whole life, especially through tragedies which you've had a lot of? What has kept you strong?Patricio Serna:	Isabelle again taught me this prayer that I say when I wake up every morning. The light of God surrounds me. The love of God enfolds me. The power of God protects me. The presence of God watches over me. Wherever I am, God is, and that keeps me going. Also I say, ""Lord, nothing is going to happen to me today that you and I together can't handle."" As a judge, I face many tough decisions, but I sleep well and I have peace of mind and I know that the Supreme Court is a last chance for justice that disenfranchised, the seniors, the elderly, Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans. We're there to give them justice. They deserve a place at the table. Everyone deserves a place at the table and it's my goal to see that they get that place.Anna Alicia Serna:	It's very reassuring that we still have people that have the priority straight for everybody. I also wanted to ask you, when I get older and have my own kids, what do you hope for all of the future generations?Patricio Serna:	I just hope that your mama and I can live to a ripe old age and enjoy our children and grandchildren. Because I was 42 when I married your mama. So you know we'll be celebrating our 30th anniversary in December, and I turned 71 in August. So I just hope that God gives us health and longevity so that we can enjoy our grandchildren because they're a special joy. Gracie just brings so much joy in everything she does, and she is growing so fast, and she's so smart, and it's just a joy to be with her.Anna Alicia Serna:	Mom, same question to you. What do you hope for all of us in the future?Eloise Serna:	A mother's hope is always that her children find happiness in what they do with their families and that they teach their children as well. To bring them up right, to teach them what's right and what's wrong, and to live for them, that's what we do. We live for our children. Now, we worked with you, we loved you and educated you. That's what I'd like to see the kids do is go for an education [00:30:00] and learn the right things, and to produce, and be good citizens, and good children to their parents and to the community, and to give of themselves, and I see you passing on those traits.Anna Alicia Serna:	Well, I'm getting emotional. I would say that you two are the most inspirational people to me because you've always just stressed how important family is and the health and education, and I thank you for instilling these in me. I don't know why I'm getting so emotional. I'm just really grateful for this opportunity to document this and I will share it with my children in the future. I just plan on preserving our tradition, our culture, and sharing your stories with my children. We're going to pass on all the traditions. I just thank you both for making me to be a grateful person. I'm so grateful to have you as parents and I hope I make you proud.Anna Alicia Serna:	You have made us proud.Patricio Serna:	You already have. Mama just said something that is so true. We, as parents, live for you, our children, and you will follow that tradition. You're our life, we live for you, and that's how it should be. She also mentioned that we should do what makes us happy. I'm so happy as a Justice on the Supreme Court. I could have retired years ago, but I love going to work, I love reading the briefs, I love making the decisions, writing the opinions, working with my colleagues on the court. So I always stress, do what makes you happy in life. I know some parents force their children to do something that they just are not happy in. They're happy in music and yet they force them to be doctors or lawyers. In some cases, they've even committed suicide and only then do the parents realize, ""Oh my gosh, I wanted to mold them after myself instead of letting them do what they love doing."" But know, whatever you love doing, we support you a 100 percent.Anna Alicia Serna:	I think that's why our relationship is so open and honest is because I know you believe in me, and my decisions, and my instincts. I think that's why we are so close is because I know I always have your support no matter what I do as long as I'm happy and doing all I can. That's why I decided to become a teacher, is because I want students to know they can do whatever they want as long as they have determination and they believe in themselves just like both of you taught me. I want to pass that on not just to my own children, but also to the students I teach that they should take pride in who they are and their culture, do what they want to do and be who they want to be. I thank you guys for letting me be what I want to be.Eloise Serna:	We want to thank you for being a great child, a great student, a great person, and the wonderful woman you've become. We're very proud of you and we're very happy that you are going into education, and we're there for you at all times. I'm very pleased with my three children. I think sometimes you wonder if you're doing a good job, but then in the end, it's so wonderful to see them blossom.Anna Alicia Serna:	It all works out.Eloise Serna:	Yes, it all works out. Because you teach them everything you want them to learn. Then, we make mistakes as we go along. But then in the end, here's these wonderful adults that become your friends and we support each other and love you very much.Anna Alicia Serna:	Thanks.Patricio Serna:	I tell my friends that have new babies, I say, ""Enjoy them every second because in the blink of an eye, there will be off to school."" They say, ""Yes, we do."" In the blink of an eye, you and Elena grew up and went to school and then went away to school. We love you and we talk to you every single day. So I look at your pictures in the office, I have pictures of you-all as little girls and then current pictures because as far as I'm concerned, you'll always be my little [00:35:00] girls, John will always be a little boy, and now Gracie.Anna Alicia Serna:	Well, I know when she's an adult, she'll probably listen to this. We actually saw her earlier today, it's a good day. So who knows the next time I hear this besides later today. But who knows, maybe decades, I may be in Washington, who knows?Anna Alicia Serna:	That's right.Patricio Serna:	That's right.Anna Alicia Serna:	What will happen since then? Right now I'm very happy with who I am and with my family and just proud and happy.Eloise Serna:	I'm glad we had the opportunity to do this interview. I want to thank the people that are involved with this preservation of history, and I'm very proud of who we are and it's wonderful.Patricio Serna:	Also, I'd like to express my appreciation to this program that's preserving history. Because in years to come, people will listen to us and it'll bring back memories to them of their family. I just hope that everyone who listens to it, will have wonderful, loving families because that's what it's all about, familia.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
MBY006615,"Juan José Peña:	[00:00:00] My name is Juan José Peña. I am 64 years old. Today is the 12th of June of 2010. We're at Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am here with my son Federico Ezequiel Peña.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	I'm Federico Peña, I'm 31. It's June 12th, 2010 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm here with my dad, Juan José Peña.Juan José Peña:	As a background of the Peña family, as far as I've found from my studies, originated in Northern Spain in the Valley of Mena, and various branches of the family moved into different areas of Spain. One branch of the family moved to Uncastillo, which is towards the Southern part of Spain, and another part of the family moved to Cuenca, which is our branch of the family. From the Peña family in Cuenca, Juan de la Peña is as far back as I've been able to go in the genealogy, and Juan de la Peña's son, Aparecio de la Peña came to Cuba, established himself there, and he took part in the conquest of Mexico with Hernan Cortes. Aparecio de la Peña's son, Juan de la Peña, came to New Mexico with a Francisco Vasquez de Coronado expedition in 1539, and they traveled throughout different parts of the Southwest. He returned to Mexico City and the Peña family in New Mexico established itself here permanently after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Baltazar Francisco de la Peña came to New Mexico with the reconquest of Diego de Vargas in the second troop that came from Zacatecas, Mexico, and he was a soldier at the Presidio de Santa Fe. His son, Miguel de la Peña, was the Mayor of Hermes and his son, Jose Miguel de Peña Segundo, was the founder of the community of Peña Blanca. Their son, Domingo de la Peña, then moved into what is now Las Vegas, was one of the founders of the Las Vegas Land Grant, and his son, Jose Gathoro De la Peña, established a ranch in the area that is now from Storey Lake to the Rio Sapeyo and my grandfather, Federico Peña, then was born in la Cieneguilla which was the original land grant of the family, and from there our family proceeded to move to Southern New Mexico because a rift that occured between my grandfather because his father had given him and taken away from him part of the ranch property that was the Peña family legacy. So I was born in Hagan, New Mexico, and then when I was about three years old, we came back to Las Vegas, New Mexico where I grew up in Robertson, Las Vegas. I attended the Las Vegas public schools, Castle Elementary School, Castle Junior High School, Robertson High School, and I took my Bachelor's Degree at Highlands, and then from there after I became active in the Land Grant Movement, with was Reies Lopez Tijerina in 1964. I was drafted and went to the US Army in 1970. Spent one year in Vietnam, came back, finished my Master's Degree, and then I taught at Highlands University until 1978, at which time I came to University of New Mexico to come to work on my doctorate, which I was unable to finish because I ran out of money. Then I move back to Las Vegas and eventually came back to Albuquerque to work as an interpreter, where I again, after a time became active with the Chicano Movement through the American GI Forum as well as the Hispano Roundtable, and various other organizations. Our family basically was mostly grounded in Las Vegas. Although Federico was born in Las Vegas and he grew up in a Albuquerque. Federico, [00:05:00] you want to tell us something about yourself?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	It's not something I'm really good at but yeah. Basically I moved with my mom. She got custody of me when I was four and she moved down here to Albuquerque. So, yeah, I just basically lived with my mom for awhile. My dad was fighting for custody. Finally got joint custody when I went to middle school and then joint custody till I was 18, and then I am pulled out for a while, then came back and living with my dad. So my history is a lot quicker and shorter. A lot less interesting.Juan José Peña:	During the time that I was a professor of Highlands University, I served as a professor of Spanish and I was the Director of Chicano Studies and the coordinator of Ethnic Studies, and during that time I was very active with the Partido de la Raza Unida, which was a Chicano political party which at that time had almost 1 million members and had 19 states affiliated to the Partido de la Raza Unida. I also worked with the Partido Socialista Independientes de Latino America. I served on the executive committee. I was also very active in organizing the Partido La Raza New Mexico, and in 1976, I became National President of the Partido la Raza Unida. It was then that I became a member of the Executive Committee of the Partido Socialista de Latino America, and I was very active in working with our sister party in Mexico, the Partido Socialista de Trabajadores, as well as the Partido Socialista Independientes. I led a delegation to Lebanon to meet with the Palestinians and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1981, and it was at that time then that I had to drop out of college and drop out of the movement for a time, and then later returned as I said, to be active with the Movimiento. Hispanos in New Mexico have a very long tradition, especially, in Northern New Mexico, because we're a native population, and as such, then we have our own forms of speaking which uses much of the Archaic Spanish, and we use a lot of slang as many of the Spanish speakers do all around. They use a lot of anglicisms, Spanglish and terms of that nature. But Northern New Mexico's cultural formation is very different from that of, say, Hispanos in Texas, Arizona California, Florida, or the New Yorkinos in New York or Nuevo Yorkeños in New York and Chicago. So we're quite a different people. Federico, what have been your observations, for example, say, of the Hispanos or Chicanos in California and Texas?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Well, yeah, there are some certain changes. There are differences, I should say, but I haven't really experienced that much. For me, personally, I was whitewashed somewhat because I went to public school and then I went to private schools since I was in fifth grade. For St. Therese and St. Pius, I have been anglicanized, you might say, something like that. I never really associated that much in the barrio or met with a lot of people outside that, but like a little, in a close contact way, or friendships, or anything like that. So I've been isolated. But yeah, there are differences, definitely. For example, here in New Mexico, a lot of Chicanos and Mexicanos just can't get along. I don't know. Well, how would you think of the differences there are?Juan José Peña:	Well, the differences between the Chicanos and Mexicanos are cultural because, although Hispanos are from New Mexico, the Chicanos have been acculturated to a certain degree. We're somewhere in between the traditional Hispano culture, which are basically native to New Mexico, and the acculturated Hispano culture, which has existed basically since World War II. Then the Mexicanos, of course, they still have their traditional ways of speaking and the culture mannerisms that they brought with them from Mexico, which differentiates them from hispanos. But the interesting thing is that there's a lot of intermarriage going on now between Hispanos and Mexicanos. [00:10:00] For example, your mother was a Mexicana, who's become very much anglicized and acculturated.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, I know, but I don't know, when I've gotten with some of my friends, like Angelo and we've gone to like Charlie and stuff like that. Every time I'm with the Chicanos and native Mexicans, they were always here bashing about Mexicanos that are coming in, and this and the other and putting them down or something like that. I don't know. But I guess on a one to one basis, I don't see why there should be any problem, but for some reason, just culturally or something like that.Juan José Peña:	Well, the interesting thing though is that a lot of Mexicanos are marrying New Mexico Hispanos, and interestingly, there are quite a few New Mexican Hispanos that are also marrying Mexicanas. So while there is conflict than there are fights between Chicanos and Mexicanos, there is a fusion that's taking place together with the conflict. The Mexicano population is growing exponentially, and it's grown quite a bit, even here in New Mexico. But the Mexicano population in Texas, Arizona, California, even places like Nebraska, Kansas, and as far away as New York, the Mexicano population is growing by leaps and bounds, and even here in New Mexico. I know that although there's dislike by New Mexicanos for the Mexicanos, there's beginning to be a convergence and as I say, the inter-marrying and the coming together in the schools is bringing the people together quite a bit. Also, the racism that's taking place now, for example, in places like Arizona, is the kind of racism that I grew up with when I was growing up in the late 1940s, the early 1950s because I grew up with no Mexicans or dogs allowed signs in Southern New Mexico. I'm beginning to see a lot of that in Arizona, it's rampant. In New Mexico, it's starting to increase and I'm seeing that it's also starting to infect some of our own people. For example, our Hispano candidate for governor is reciting a lot of the same racist rhetoric that I used to hear from the white racists back in the 1950s, and it's all over the internet, and we're getting a backlash even among the Hispanos because I get a lot of hate e-mails because I defend the Mexicanos and their role in working with this. Because I do remember even in Las Vegas, the Anglos were only about 25 percent. They were 25 percent of East Las Vegas. West Las Vegas was almost 100 percent Hispano and yet the Anglos control the entire economy. They control the banks, they control the big stores, they held the educational posts, they controlled Highlands University, the East Las Vegas schools, the East Las Vegas City Council. Of course, they didn't control the County Commissioner, the West Las Vegas schools, but they had a lot of control in Las Vegas, which was mostly Hispano. But what was your interaction with the Anglo students at St. Pius or at the other schools?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	I got along very well with them. There was no hint of racism or anything like that. Basically, that's pretty much how we became, I guess, you can say, the whitewashed or whatever you want to call it, but yeah, I was pretty much just like them. We probably should have brought him into the interview, he could have talked a lot about up these interactions over there at Albuquerque High. But yeah, if a lot of Mexicanos that are coming here, if they have their old ways of doing it or culturally different and they don't really mix very well with the white population or the Chicanos, but in school, that's when it starts to change. Like I said, with me, that's how I started, I don't know, I guess you can call it being more white or whatever you want to call it. I was going to say that. Well, that's all I was with the affluent Anglo population over there. There was Roberto Lopez that was over there, but he was basically the only [00:15:00] one. Someone I knew freshmen year, Carlos Montoya, he didn't like it there at all because he was more in the old ways. He was more used to Barrio neighborhood kind of thing and he found it weird over there in St. Pius, so he didn't really get along very well and he dropped out after or transferred schools after the freshman year.FEMALE_1:	Was that ever something that you thought about or awkward for you to feel like one of the very few?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	No, like I said, I got along well with pretty much everybody and so did Roberto. Those are the only two that really made it all the way through. There were some too, but they were mixed Anglo, Well, it's montaños, something like that, but they were really mixed, half Chicano, half white or whatever. But yeah, it was mostly predominately white.FEMALE_1:	How about outside of school? Have about going home? Was that something that you've thought about your experience being maybe a little bit different?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, but like I said, I didn't really associate in Nabario that much. I didn't go out and meet people out in Nabario, or where else from, or anything like that. I was pretty isolated so that's how I grew up.Juan José Peña:	But at the same time, you grew up with the second generation Mexicanos, for example, like Miguel Angel and Angelito and Evita. They were second generation Mexicanos.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, neighbors, but we really didn't go out and party or anything like that. We just knew each other because we were neighbors. We associated a lot when we were together, we went up to Algodones with Jose, Jesus, and some stuff like that. But we always stayed in our group.Juan José Peña:	Which was a blended family too, Mexicano and Chicana?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah. We basically just did that in our own little group there and didn't go out that much and intermingle with a lot of the people.Juan José Peña:	But then again, you've lived most of your life in Nabario Barelas, right?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, but I still don't know who my neighbors so I have no idea.FEMALE_2:	How about you, Juan ? What were you like growing up? What was your childhood like?Juan José Peña:	Well, we grew up on a very poor family. We were on welfare, almost from the time we moved to our new house on 4th Street. It was interesting because, first of all, we lived over at my great uncle's house on railroad which was part of barrio, and then my grandfather wasn't able to get the ranch from his brothers, the ranch that he'd been promised by his father, so we moved into an Anglo neighborhood. The neighborhood that we lived in, basically, the only two people who were different were our family, which was Chicano or Mexicano, and the Nelson family. The father was an Indian. He was an upholster, but his wife was an Anglo nurse, so their kids were half Indian, half Anglo. I grew up in that neighborhood, so I learn a lot of the white mannerisms, but at the same time, I spent a lot of time with my grandfather and his brothers and their families, so I learned to speak in English in the neighborhood. With our families, we spoke nothing but Spanish, so I grew up with monolingual Spanish and monolingual English, so I was able to go back and forth between the two, but I learned a great deal of how the Anglo culture function; how their parents were, what their attitudes were, and things of this sort. So the interesting thing is that some Chicano began moving into the neighborhood, and so the gang that I formed was half Chicano, half Anglo. So then, we played football, baseball, basketball with the other neighborhoods around which were mostly Anglo, although there were some Chicanos. I had a lot of friends who were in the railroad avenue, Commerce Street neighborhood, so I would go down to those neighborhoods quite a bit. So I was just right between the two cultures, living in my Anglo neighborhood. But the Anglo neighborhood was a square that was bounded basically by 1st Street on the east, by 9th Street on the west, by Tilden Avenue on the south side, and by Mills Avenue on the north side. That was basically the Anglo community, and I got to know a lot of the people all around my area and got to [00:20:00] be with them. I'd go to their houses, they'd come to mine. They had everything we didn't have because like I said, we were growing up poor and we got commodities. We get some of the bean; navy beans, the white beans, the commodity cheese, things of those sorts because there weren't food stamps back then. Then my grandfather and my mother received welfare payments because my father died when I was very young. Then we made a stretch as far as we could. My grandfather was great at making money stretch, but I mean, our heating was mostly with firewood, although we did have a gas oven, a gas heater or gas heaters, but we'd start going for wood starting in March until the snow fell in November. So every weekend, we would go for wood and we would spend a lot of time visiting my great uncle's families, talking to them. We'd visit my uncle down in Southern New Mexico. He had a fruit farm, so we would go down there every year and I would get together with my cousins in Fort Sumner and Glencoe, Roswell, and various other places. I think that's the first time I had recognition of how deep the racism was because I remember, we went with my uncle to buy bread. The old bread over it, one of the large stores. In life, I felt a lot of heat, and I looked up and there was this big, slim Anglo cowboy, with his cowboy hat and everything, looking at me with hatred, like I had no right to exist. A lot of the parents in the neighborhood that I grew up in were also prejudiced, but they let their kids play with me because I was in the neighborhood. Then I formed the gang, I was the leader of the gang, but my grandfather made me work a great deal. Every morning, I'd have to bring firewood into the house before going to school. A lot of times, we'd take the truck. We'd go buy milk at the Dairy in one gallon jugs, and then I'd go to school, come home for lunch because we were only a block away, and then in the afternoon, I would have to bring in more wood for the following day, or for that evening actually because I'd bring in more wood in the morning. I was cutting wood and chopping wood from a very small age. My grandfather would make me kill the chickens, and help him kill the sheep and then clean the sheep. Every fall, we'd buy sheep, we'd kill them and hanging them up them in the garage, and then we just kept meat up during the whole winter. Then he would have me kill the chickens, plug them into the whole nine yards, and we'd spend lot of time over at my great uncle's ranch. What we do, we'd go out there. We have a parcel of land that we planted, so we would grow corn out in Sapello. So we would grow corn, we'd grow peas, then we had an orchard there that we had to tend to because we could get part of the orchard. Then we would pick quelites, or a wild spinach, and verdolagas or purslane. Quelites is lamb's quarter. I guess a lot of people outside of New Mexico probably wouldn't know it, but quelite was our spinach. We would use those with our meals, and then we would help them out with a ranch. For example, I used to help take the horses to water and milk the cow, and then during the day, I would help out in cleaning the irrigation ditch, and also weeding the section that we had planted. So I did a lot of work, both with animals, working on the farm or the ranch, and also doing a lot of farm work on my great uncle's farm. So I learned to ride at a very young age. I started riding horses at about the age of four, and my grandfather had me digging ditches as soon as I was old enough to pick up a pick ax, and chopping wood as soon as I could hold the ax, and he had me painting the house, going with him to bring sand [00:25:00] and to bring cement. So my grandfather taught me how to do a lot of work. He had been a carpenter a good part of his life. After he left the ranch, he worked as a carpenter, so he taught me a great deal about carpentry during the time that I was growing up. But at the same time, he would give me time to go out and play with the kids. I was a wild child because when my grandfather would go to bed at eight, I would sneak out the back window upstairs. I was the only one who slept upstairs, so we would all sneak out and we'd meet over at the street light, and then we either go downtown, or go to the baseball games, or go out and get in trouble, things of that sort.FEMALE_1:	What about your mom? What was she up to while you're growing up? What was she like?Juan José Peña:	Well, my mom was very much a traditional mother. She had mental retardation problems, but she was able to handle all the household chores. She would get up in the morning and she would have breakfast for us at seven o'clock, and then after that she'd start washing clothes, or cleaning house, or doing things of that sort. Then she would make lunch for us at noon and make dinner for us at night. We had the household where we had hot tortillas three times a day, homemade. So then in the evening, I remember when I was very small, I guess she was big fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Men of Mars, and so she would tell the stories about Men of Mars. I guess that was what led to my becoming a fan of science fiction during my middle teen years.FEMALE_1:	Do you remember any of the stories that she would tell you?Juan José Peña:	Well, basically, some of the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories, the Men of Mars, Maid of Mars, and things about La Llorona and El Coco, or El Cucuy, as a lot of people say, so she would tell the stories like that when I was small. But my grandfather started me very early to reading because he had a primer, and when I was about four years old, he taught me Spanish from the primer. Then when we're done with the primer, he used the Bible as the textbook. So by the time I was six years old, I had already read the Bible, cover to cover. Then of course, I played a lot out in the street. We played the seasonal games. We had vacant lots by the house, so we'd play baseball on the vacant lots. During the winter, we'd have snowball fights. Sometimes, we'd have mud ball fights, we had spitball fights. We used to make very tall stilts, and so we'd have bumping fights on the stilts. And you, Federico? Is there something you experienced growing up?FEMALE_1:	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just meant you face each other.Juan José Peña:	No, that's all right.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Now, for me, probably, the happiest time was going up to Algodones with Jesus and stuff like that. But back when I was with my mom was at the time, she's really strict. She's an old-world Mexicano, so she just want us doing much. She was really strict, and then let us do a whole lot. For us, when I got my half-brother with her after she remarried, for us, it was better to just stay out of her way and just do our own little things and not upset her in any way, so we just watch TV or go do something like that. But going up to Algodones during visitations, that was a lot of fun. I enjoyed going to the bosque with the motorcycles. That was a lot of fun. We're just staying there, renting a movie, and having pizza or whatever. Sometimes going out to dollar movies or whatever we're watching. That was always a lot of fun. I used to enjoy that a lot.Juan José Peña:	But then also, you started driving a tractor when you were four-years-old, right?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, driving. Yeah, you'd let me drive the car also when I was little. That was a lot of fun.Juan José Peña:	Yeah, you used to drive the car out to Storey Lake. When you were 12 years- old, you drove half the way to California and back, right?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, something like that.FEMALE_1:	What was your personality like as a kid?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	I'm not sure. My dad can answer it better than that. Until about eighth grade and middle school, and then I guess when I was in eighth grade, basically everybody I called my friend at school pretty much betrayed me. After that, I became really quiet, and introverted, and stuff like that. So I fell back into myself more. Aside from that, other than that, growing up, I always had to worry about asthma as well. For a period there, I was averaging the hospital almost once a month being rushed over there, and waking and [00:30:00] just not being able to breathe. A few times, I just passed out right after I woke up and they had to give me CPR a few times. Thankfully, that diminished at about the same time in seventh, eighth grade and before I got into high school. I don't know. But generally, I just got more introverted after that.Juan José Peña:	But then we used to go camping a lot.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, earlier on.Juan José Peña:	You had the small motorcycle.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, earlier on, like I mentioned there, going to the bus on a motorcycle, that was always a lot of fun.Juan José Peña:	Yeah. We'd down to the river, swim in the river.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah. I got the loophole for New Mexico that allowed you to get your license for 100 cc motorcycle when you're 13. So that was fun, I enjoyed that a lot.Juan José Peña:	Yeah. We used to ride out to Algodones on the motorcycle, isn't it? Then just ride all around all over Algodones.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, and the bosque, yeah, until the Indians closed down their land, they didn't let us out there anymore. But I'd like into compuertas y todo eso, that was always a lot of fun.Juan José Peña:	Then you played basketball, right? In middle school?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Middle school, I stunk, I didn't care about that, and I hated practice.Juan José Peña:	We went camping a lot. We traveled a lot, right? What do you think about some of the places that we traveled to? California, Florida?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah. I enjoyed it a lot. Visiting new places and then pretty after high school, me and Mark Purina who I met over there at st. Pius, we did it a lot of that too. We'd take trips all through the south and we went through the Midwest, and took a flight to come to California instead of Montreal, Quebec, and stuff like that, during spring break or during the summer, or something like that. I'd always visit him over Iowa City and there was a lot of fun. I always enjoyed that, though one of the moments I didn't like was that little incident in Wyoming that I always like to mention.FEMALE_1:	What happened in Wyoming?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Basically, on the way back, we're driving back through Casper, Wyoming, Natrona County, which I will remember forever. Anyways, the state trooper was coming down the highway behind us, he passed me and saw me driving. Then he pulled back and followed me for about probably 30 minutes until he found a reason to stop me. When I was getting off at a gas part to put some gas. Anyways, he basically said my license was suspended, unless I had $400, he'd arrest me, which he did. Towed my car, told my friend, he behooves him to leave, Mark Perino. Basically, when I got there, they stripped me naked, put me in isolation, calling me a suicide risk. I had no idea why he had done this. They wasn't answering my questions. It was just a suspended the license, they were arresting me. Then finally, Mark managed to walk down to the courthouse, get some money to bail me out later that evening after about eight hours. Wearing this cloth paper towel forever, and then he got me out and basically made about 10,000 phone calls back over here trying to figure what happened. It turns out the ticket that I paid, therefore, I have to cancel the court date and put it as failure to appear. But the guy that arrested me, he just didn't like me.Juan José Peña:	But you were racially profiled, weren't you?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Pretty much, yeah. Like I said, he was going to pass me by until he saw me driving and just pulled back and stuff when he saw me driving. Then when he did stop me, basically, did everything he could just to make my life miserable. Towed my car when Mark was right there, he could have taken it. Everything like that, because they had stripped me naked and they were calling me a suicide risk and stuff like that.FEMALE_1:	How old were you?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	This was when I was 19, something like that, 19, I think so. I had never been to jail before so that was traumatic for me. I can noticed that too. I used to visit my friends because he went to the University of Iowa. But yeah, sometimes I stop in North Nebraska, something like that, just to eat or something like that. There was people looking at me and just wondering, I don't know, giving me glares and stuff like that. Wondering what I'm doing there or whatever. Once I got to Iowa City itself though, it was a college town and it was really nice. I enjoyed it there. Yeah, that was just interesting.FEMALE_1:	It must have been hard for you as a father to hear about this. Do you remember that?Juan José Peña:	Yes. In fact, I called a lawyer friend of mine and he called down there and started applying pressure, and then I sent some money, in fact, I think I sent the money for your bail.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, I don't know. Mark was the one that was handling all that, I was stuck in the cell.Juan José Peña:	Yeah, Mark called me and I sent the money for the bail. Then I started applying pressure. I told them that I worked with the federal courts and that I knew a certain judge from over there. [00:35:00] Finally, they cut him loose.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	We had to fax all the paper work from over here, saying that I had already paid that ticket. Then that my license shouldn't have been suspended and the date is basically their mistake. Then they just said, okay, you're free to go, without a sorry or anything like that, after costing me $400 to pay the tow, and for the hotel there, and everything else. It was just a mess. I don't know. That's really one of the things that really pisses me of.Juan José Peña:	One of the interesting things in my childhood was that my grandfather was basically my history teacher because he knew a lot of our history. Of course, a lot of it, I researched later on on my own once I started finding out things about our family, and I've been researching it ever since. But I was very athletic when I was in high school, I played varsity football. I was a wrestler, I ran track. Then in college, I played college football my first year, and then I played semi-professional ice hockey, which there weren't very many of us Hispanos that were playing ice hockey, much less semi-professional, I was on a team. Then when I went to Vietnam, I was offered officer at candidate school and I turned it down because I didn't want to do more time. But the time that I was in Vietnam, I spent in combat. So when I came back, then I was a combat veteran and I helped organize the Vietnam Veterans of New Mexico here in New Mexico. Then I became active with the movement again, with the Chicano Associated Students Organization, and then I became active in Chicano Studies. I was one of the founders of the National Association for Chicano Studies and the New Mexico Association for Chicano Studies. I served as president of the New Mexico Association for Chicano studies for about 10 years until the association dissolved. Then as I say, I was active in the Partido de la Raza Unidad. I served as state president for many years and then I served as national president until I left, and then I became active again when I was recruited into the American JI4. Then I went back active with the New Mexico chapter, Vietnam Veterans of New Mexico, and the Vietnam Veterans of America chapter in New Mexico and I worked actively with them. I've been very active in a lot of community matters. Federico, do you have anything for a wrap up?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Not really.Juan José Peña:	How about the trip to Spain?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	That was really enjoyable. I really enjoyed that trip. It's a trip of a lifetime. Everybody needs a trip like that, I think so. It's always nice to visit your roots and see where you came from, stuff like that.FEMALE_1:	Did you go to Spain together?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah.Juan José Peña:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	When was that?Juan José Peña:	In 2003. Yeah, we went to Mexico in 2000 and then we went to Spain in 2003.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah. The trip to Mexico was also pretty interesting. We just had a drive to Cancun. Definitely an experience. So are we all done here?Juan José Peña:	Well, the interesting thing is Federico takes an interest wherever he goes, whereas his sister will sleep through most of the landscape. Well, the place she wanted to go to in Madrid was the Hard Rock Cafe in Madrid.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, she didn't care about the old castles, the centuries-old castles, or any of the history of the town there, the statues or anything like that. Just had no interest.Juan José Peña:	We noticed a lot of Peña names and then we crossed over into Africa. We went into Tangiers.Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, spent a day there.Juan José Peña:	I think in essence, I can say we've had the Chinese curse. I could say that our life has definitely been an interesting life enough, Federico?Federico Ezequiel Peña:	Yeah, definitely.Juan José Peña:	Yeah. We've gone through a lot of experiences and what I' mostly don't like right now is it seems like we're going back to the 1950s. The racism and all the things that are going on in Arizona, for example. The anti-Mexican, anti-immigrant laws, the laws against Chicano studies, the laws against teachers having an accent, and things of this sort. The thing is that it seems to be spreading, that there are other states that are going back to that. For me, it's like deja vu all over again. It's like we're going back to the 1950s and we haven't even finished the Civil Rights Movements, whether for [00:40:00] blacks or for Chicanos. It looks like now as an old man, I'm going to have to take up the movement again, like one of my inspirations, Don Florencio Aragon, who in the '70s was one of our senior advisers in the Partido de la Raza Unida. But it looks like we're going to have to write the Chicano movement all over again.FEMALE_1:	Well, thank you both so much.Juan José Peña:	You're very welcome.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
MBY006639,"Patricia Chavez:	[00:00:00] My name is Patricia Chavez, I am 55 years old. Today, is June 18th, 2010. We are at the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am married to Louis De Romero.Louis De Romero:	I am Louis De Romero, and my age is 68, almost 69. Today's date is June 18th, 2010, and we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm being interviewed by my life partner, Patricia Chavez.Patricia Chavez:	Speaking of life partners, Mr. Louis, since I know so much about you, what I really want to hear about is your early life story. What has shaped you the most? What memories or early people situations has influenced your life story?Louis De Romero:	It's a great question Patricia, thank you for that. As you know, I was born and raised in Vadito, New Mexico. Every time I say that to somebody, when asked me where I'm from in my early life, I think of Hillary Clinton's book, It Takes A Village. Vadito was a little tiny, it still is, a little village in Northern New Mexico, and what I relate to the most in terms of early life is the fact that as I walked to school, elementary school, about half-a-mile each way, all the houses that I passed, which weren't that many, were of elderly people that knew me, and they knew me well. It influenced me and shaped me in a way that I knew I had to behave, because they were all interfacing with each other and with my parents. To some degree, they passed on their values. For example, the closest neighbor to the elementary school that I used to go to was my uncle, Margarito, my favorite uncle on my father's side. He used to come out, not every day, but he's come out from his little orchard that he had. Especially in the fall, and he had a little bucket full of apples, and he would give it to us kids as we went by. That, of course, perpetuated love for my uncle, Margarito, of course. But in many other ways, I remember one day I was hit on the top of my head with a rock by another kid in second grade, and we got into little fight over some toys or something. On my way home for lunch, because we used to go home for lunch, he threw a rock and he hit me right here, split my head, and I was bleeding. Another neighbor saw me, and she took me in her house and washed me up, and wrapped a diaper around as a bandage. Here, I go home to my mother with a diaper around my head. But in many other ways, I knew that the people there knew my parents, and that my parents were well-respected. There was always this little feeling of a village looking out for you. But now, looking back on it many, many years, still getting back to your question about how has that shaped me, it had both its good and its bad. Because the negative side of it was that, we were always expected to defer to somebody that was elder or had a higher station in life than myself. Then later, as I became a full-blown professional many years later, I can look back and say that I kept that value or that habit of always deferring to somebody that was of a higher authority, which I think sometimes, it kept me from expressing myself more fully when I should have. At the same time, the real positive thing about that was that, it made me into a really good, loyal, service oriented professional, because I had a value that you always had to deliver, and I did, so it became part of my professional background. That's a long answer to your question, but that's how it shaped my early life, shaped me. Of course, there was family things, [00:05:00] my father Raymundo, and he was a powerful influence because he was a leader in the community and involved in the community with the Azectas.Patricia Chavez:	I want to get back to  people, and missions, and situations that have shaped you. But as I recall, your daddy, Raymundo, spent the majority of your early life working in Los Alamos, as one of the early Hispanic professionals in Los Alamos. But what I'd like to hear more about is the influence in your early childhood about women around you. Obviously, you came from a very large family, much larger than mine, and I want to hear more about your family and those influences on the feminine side, which helped to develop you into the man you are today.Louis De Romero:	Thank you. I came from a very traditional Hispanic family, where the man was always the authority, made all these major decisions, and so forth. Yes, my dad worked in Los Alamos, so he was away throughout the week. He came home on weekends only for 20 years. Through that period of my life, I had about four or five really strong women who I was very close to and we're shaping me. I loved them all and respected them, and I want to mention who they were. I grew up in my early days just knowing that any woman could do anything. I never had that bias, which was strange and unusual because here I was growing up in a community.Patricia Chavez:	In Vadito, New Mexico. Right.Louis De Romero:	Where everything was traditionally held to the males being in authority. First of all, was my grandmother. Probably, one of the most influential people in my life period, Rafaelita. We call her Mi Lopez. The reasons she was, was because I used to go spend every evening with her. She was in her '70s and '80s at that time. The way she spoke, the way she loved me, the way she made decisions, because he lived by herself by then, she was a widow. She had quite a bit of property that she had leftover from her husband when my grandfather died. The decision she made was very matter of fact, you can do it. I remember one day, this drunk guy was going up the street. I'll never forget this. Here's my grandma wearing her little [inaudible 00:07:48]. She comes out to the sidewalk and she watches this guy, and she calls him over. He stumbled over towards her and she proceeds to reading the right act. She told him, ""You better shape up, you're wasting your life away,"" and I'm standing there listened. How can my grandma say that to a drunk? What if he turns around and gets mean with her? But no, he just coward away. Anyway, that's my grandma, and then I won't be as long with on the others. But my mother, she had to make all the decisions while my dad was away. She was very strong. But my mother, she tended to discipline through negative. I still remember my mother always telling me what I could not do, and my father would come home on the weekends and he would empower me as to what I could do. It's a good balance really. Then after that, was the neighbor, and they had a little sawmill, and I worked for them as a 16-year-old. Same way, strong, and they had a bar. She was a bartender also, and so she was very used to dealing with unruly men, and so forth. Then there was the Bowlanders. Mrs. Bowlander, constantly, she was managing the business.Patricia Chavez:	She was actually your first female non-Hispanic influence in terms of your life.Louis De Romero:	Yes. Right. Exactly. Thank you for clarifying that because that's true. As a matter of fact, that was my real immersion into non-Hispanic culture, which was very helpful to me, because it opened my eyes a little bit more. She was constantly after me. ""Louis, when are you going to go back to college? When are you going to go to college?"" Kept pushing me, and showing me what I was capable of doing. She shaped me a lot. As a matter of fact, I give her more credit than I do my own parents for me going back to college. Then I married you.Patricia Chavez:	Tell me [00:10:00] a little bit more about all of them in terms of her influenceLouis De Romero:	No I want to tell you about you. A very strong woman, a network. You're the one that taught me how to network, and you and I were working together in San Francisco during a time when the issue about male-female relationships in the workforce were all about that, so yeah, you have been a big influence in shaping me too, especially in my later life. Back to Olive Bowlander what was it you wanted to know?Patricia Chavez:	See, now, you got me off course, I was still on the fifth woman. I was like ""What? Okay."" So Olive, I remember Olive as being entrepreneur herself.Louis De Romero:	Right.Patricia Chavez:	So let's talk about the entrepreneurial spirit that perhaps she shared with you that also helped you to become much like an entrepreneur but leading into your position, an intrapreneur?Louis De Romero:	Yeah, I think so. Olive helped me see that she could equally manage a business as her husband, and they treated each other that way. Then she taught me business techniques.Patricia Chavez:	What did she own?Louis De Romero:	[inaudible 00:11:17] the resort. It was a summer winter resort.Patricia Chavez:	Ski area, right?Louis De Romero:	Yeah, right. But she was humble too because I used to think of the Bowlanders as real high status that I had to look up to, and so she'd give me an assignment, for example, to go clean a cabin and then before I knew it, she would come in and help me and work right beside me. I remember another incident probably one of the very few overt discrimination-s that I've had in my whole life. One day I fixed the flat tire for a Texan that came in and his big car and fixed it. In those days, it was a gravel road. It wasn't paved, and he took off and about an hour later he comes back. Just mad at me, and he started scolding me, and he called me ""You dirty little Mexican,"" he said. I've never been called that before.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah. In Vadito, New Mexico.Louis De Romero:	So I just stood there.Patricia Chavez:	You said, ""I'm not Mexican.""Louis De Romero:	Right. Lloyd Bowlander, the boss, Olive's husband, was working on a roof on top of one of the cabins, and he saw what was going on, and he jumped off the roof.Patricia Chavez:	Really? Wow.Louis De Romero:	He jumped off the roof and he came running up to the man, and essentially, what he did is he gave him his money back and told him to get out there, and he didn't want to ever see him come back. He says, ""You do not talk to my people that way."" He's send him scooting. Here he was, obviously, a wealthy Texan who was one of his customers, but he's sent him packing. So in other words, he favored me and my self esteem in that situation. So it gave me confidence and loyalty, of course.Patricia Chavez:	Right. In that situation, had Olive experienced that activity?Louis De Romero:	No, unless Lloyd told her. No, I don't think she witnessed that.Patricia Chavez:	So that was also another male dominant role model that you had early in your life since your daddy was not there at home.Louis De Romero:	Right.Patricia Chavez:	Lloyd, also became someone that was a father figure in a sense to you?Louis De Romero:	Yes. Like a second father. More like an older brother, quite frankly.Patricia Chavez:	Because you're the oldest and then you didn't really have, other than your daddy, that many male role models around you in your early life.Louis De Romero:	Yeah. So Lloyd would have been a powerful role model for me.Patricia Chavez:	In those early memories of experiences and the values and working early with the Bowlanders are there any nuggets that you would take from those early experiences that you would want to pass on, let's say, to your grandchildren or their children? So early values, early concepts that perhaps developed you, that you would want to leave in, perhaps, a little treasure chest for them?Louis De Romero:	Yeah. Yes, I can think of one right off the bat and maybe I'll think of some others. One was one day he came to the house and asked my father if he could use his tractor to cut into firewood, these trees, poles that had been cleared from the ski runs.Patricia Chavez:	This is Lloyd?Louis De Romero:	Yeah, Lloyd. To turn them into firewood to use in [00:15:00] the fireplaces in all the cabins and whatnot. My dad said, well, he says, ""I don't think I want to just loan you my tractor or rent it to you"", he says, ""But I think that would make a great project for Louis. So my dad and I went to look at this huge mountain of trees and poles that needed to be cut with my dad's circular saw on his tractor and my dad's says to Lloyd, he says, ""I think this can be done in about five days"". Then my dad turned to me, and says, ""Are you willing to do it?"". He says, ""If you'll do it, he says you can keep all the money except for the gas"". You pay for the gas for the tractor, and I was going to be entering my junior year in high school. I said, ""Oh, yeah, oh man, this is money."" So when I started that project, I said to myself, ""I think I can do this in three days. So I worked really hard at it and I got it done in about three and a half days. Lloyd was ecstatic about it all, and he gave me a bonus, and he offered me a job to come work weekends through my high school years, and I ended up doing that for the rest of my high school years and early college. So I learned about exceeding customer expectations and being loyal and being true to your word and following through. Following through is a core value of mine that when I say something, I promise somebody something, I try to do it a little better than what I promised, but follow through, get it done, so that your word really becomes something other people can rely on.Patricia Chavez:	So in reality, that whole experience of peak performance, you were learning that very early, exceeding the limits and values were set to you early by different people.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, and of course, I was a really good athlete in high school, so I also had that competitive spirit from athletics that added to that.Patricia Chavez:	In all those early memories, and maybe even from perhaps high school on, what were some of your happiest moments?Louis De Romero:	Wow. It's going to have to come down to moments.Patricia Chavez:	Okay.Louis De Romero:	Because there's been many happy times. Can you imagine?Patricia Chavez:	Let's just do it in bullet points.Louis De Romero:	Okay. But first of all, let me say that I've had a pretty happy life overall, period. Can you imagine what it's like growing up on a 20-acre farm, with a river running right alongside the property.Patricia Chavez:	A river runs through it.Louis De Romero:	Yeah. Having all the space to run around, and play, and clean mountain air, clean water, and a forest right there as your backyard. What a place to grow up.Patricia Chavez:	Be able to go fishing when you wanted to.Louis De Romero:	I grew up fishing anytime, yes. I didn't realize we were poor.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah.Louis De Romero:	We had everything, milk from our cows, and chickens, and rabbits, and horses, and cows, all that stuff. Vegetables and orchards with fruit.Patricia Chavez:	Your mom used the hornoLouis De Romero:	Used the horno to bake bread and she canned a lot of stuff for us and she patched our jeans and all the stuff. I grew up in a very happy childhood, real, real close brothers and sisters and cousins coming over to play and all that, but after that happy moments I can think of two right up that I really want to tell you about. One was you and me in Mendocino, California, our little picnics that we've had over the years. They all stand out but I remember one in particular, we were right on the edge of the cliffs looking out over the ocean on a blanket, having our little picnic and popping a bottle of champagne, having our little conversations, taking a little nap out in the sun. That's an example of a happy, happy moment and a memory and probably, one of the reasons it's so much in my mind right now is because we're going back there in a few weeks.Patricia Chavez:	But I also remember in that moment, in terms of happiness, how we have already planned what will happen in the event either one of us dies.Louis De Romero:	Yeah.Patricia Chavez:	[00:20:00] Yeah.Louis De Romero:	Isn't that interesting?Patricia Chavez:	I mean the forward looking to the end, I mean, that whole decision making process about us passing forward.Louis De Romero:	That's the day we would decide where we would put your ashes if you died before me.Patricia Chavez:	That's right.Louis De Romero:	That's right.Patricia Chavez:	So don't forget the champagne.Louis De Romero:	Within a happy moment we wove in a little nostalgia or sentimental value there.Patricia Chavez:	Another happy moment you had?Louis De Romero:	Another happy moment as a bullet point was just this last March, I was skiing at Deer Valley and in front of me was my son who's a tremendous expert skier.Patricia Chavez:	That's right, top skier.Louis De Romero:	Yeah. Behind him was his son, my grandson Chase. My son Cameron, my grandson Chase, then my daughter Raquel, then my granddaughter Aspen, then my little grandson Carson, and then me in the back just following this trail, people sashing down the mountain and me thinking, here they are. But they're here because my dad started me skiing when I was six years old, and then my brother, and then my sister, and then my other brother, and then my other sister.Patricia Chavez:	Right.Louis De Romero:	All of our family has become skiers because my dad started and he started because he was working for the Bowlanders at the ski area and he took an adult pair of wooden skis, cut them into half, laminated them with glue, and made a little short pair of skis that he gave me for Christmas when I was about five or six years old. That very same night on Christmas Eve, I had him take me out into the little hill behind our house just so I could slide on those little skis. Isn't it interesting how that has led to our entire family?Patricia Chavez:	Yeah.Louis De Romero:	Even my nieces and nephews. Everybody skis.Patricia Chavez:	Except for your wife, but that's okay.Louis De Romero:	That's okay.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah.Louis De Romero:	That's okay, you're my cheerleader.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah, let's talk about your daddy anymore. You talked about the early influence of your daddy and I know that he was somebody very special to you, you had all of your core developed by early women in your life, but you had the influence of your daddy in and out for 20 years. Let's talk about the later years of your dad, I know that that was some challenging times for you but had he not been there to develop you to the man you are today you perhaps could not have dealt with those challenging times. Let's speak more about your daddy, Raymundo.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, I can actually call that my dad lived to be 99 and a half as you know. Actually 99 and eight months and two days.Patricia Chavez:	We also call that a 100 since he was in the womb, right?Louis De Romero:	Yeah, right. For some people the passing of a very elderly parent can be a really sad time, but I can honestly tell you that the last year or two, probably the last year particularly of my dad's life was a happy time for me. Now that I look back on it, I don't think I could have said that at the time because yes it was very hard, it took a lot, but now that I can look back on it two years later, I am so happy and fulfilled by the way I experienced his decline and his passing the morning he died. It was to me a such a graceful decline and a graceful ending and I feel that my attention to him added to the quality of his life at the end and I feel that not only the attention, but the fact that I took the time as you know, to journal all his little stories at the end, his little sayings, dichos that he would come up with. I put them on my laptop computer and so now I have what could be a chapter in a book just about my father in his late years, particularly. My dad was a real small man in stature, but [00:25:00] a giant in character.Patricia Chavez:	Even though he was a Republican. We won't hold that against him. I would paint pictures of taped to the door of Bush as I walked in during the Clinton.Louis De Romero:	Yeah. Remember that? Remember how he used to tease you with that?Patricia Chavez:	I remember that, that was too good.Louis De Romero:	You asked me a question earlier that I want to come back to.Patricia Chavez:	Okay.Louis De Romero:	About early shaping and whatnot. One of the things that I learned from my father and I would pass this onto, this is a little bit of wisdom, and maybe I can talk sum more about wisdom later. But a piece of wisdom that my dad passed on, that I have learned to treasure is always leave a little bit of mystery about yourself with others. He says, never let everybody know you too well. Leave a little space around you, like a little buffer that is just yours. It's a place where you can change your mind, it's a place where you can make choices and leave people wondering a little bit about, why did you do that? I have found that particularly useful in my professional life. It's hard to describe and someday maybe I can articulate it better. But it's right now, I'd call it a little buffer and little bit of mystery about yourself.Patricia Chavez:	So let's jump to that professional life. So you have 35 years in one organization. Talk about how that started and where you ended.Louis De Romero:	Well, it goes back to my father again. He was a lookout man at Picuris Mountain, Northern New Mexico.Patricia Chavez:	Lookout [inaudible 00:26:51]Louis De Romero:	Picuris Mountain. A lookout tower where you watch for a forest fires.Patricia Chavez:	Okay. So he worked for Forest Service?Louis De Romero:	He worked for the Forest Service. The night that I was born. He was coming from working on a trail crew in 1941, September 14th, 1941. He had been working for the Forest Service and riding horseback, coming over the mountain after dark, and as he came into the valley of Vadito, it was completely dark, no lights. It's because it was the beginning of World War II, and there were mandatory blackouts in the cities in the United States, where there were blackouts, where nobody could turn on any lights in case the enemy was approaching. So he arrived at my grandmother's house, my mother was in labor. My dad had to go get somebody to help deliver me. Anyway, so then my father was a lookout for nine summers. When I was eight months old that following summer, one September that following summer, my mother took me on horseback and we lived with my father in this tiny little cabin.Patricia Chavez:	The look out?Louis De Romero:	Inside the look out. The Lookout head as stove on one end, it had the instrument where they would spot forest fires with called an Ella Dade, and they had a little tiny table and a cot that my mom and dad shared, and a cardboard box for me as my crib. So that was my first real home actually, really could be up to that point we're living with my grandmother. So I lived there that my first two summers of my life. So it's maybe like I was meant to work with the Forest Service, and then later, I started right out of high school.Patricia Chavez:	Who recruited you?Louis De Romero:	The District Ranger at Peniasco went to the high school principal, and says, ""I want two hire a boy,"" actually, he specified a boy, ""who has a really good academic record, and knows how to type, and that I can train to be a firefighter, a timber marker, and a clerk."" I had the highest grades of all the boys in my senior class. So I was referred and I got my summer job right out of high school. Then later, I wanted to bee a smoke jumper and went to Montana. I ended up being a hot shot firefighter in Montana for three years.Patricia Chavez:	That's where you met a lot of your close buddies, right?Louis De Romero:	A lot of my close buddies or early again, John Burton. Lot of people shaped my professional life there too. I ended up graduating from the University of Montana, as it turned out. So my first chapter of my Forest Service career was outdoors, beautiful, beautiful places. Then I transferred a lot, for that and that turned into administrative work, and I ended up [00:30:00] in San Francisco where I met you.Patricia Chavez:	Well, unfortunately, before that you had met your first wife, but we don't want to go there.Louis De Romero:	We don't want to talk about that.Patricia Chavez:	We don't want to go there. That was a mistake.Louis De Romero:	Unless you want to ask me about one of my saddest moments in my life.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah. Your saddest moments in your life being the first wife. But that's also where you ended up with your two children?Louis De Romero:	Yes. That's a wonderful, wonderful result from that.Patricia Chavez:	That's a good memory as of result of Forest Service. So tell me about the values Forest Service left upon your life? Thirty five years worth. What values and lessons do you take away from Forest Service, 35 years, that's one half of your life? When you put it into the context of life history, one half.Louis De Romero:	Oh, boy. Well, as you know, one of the greatest surprises and the things I'm proudest of, is that 10 years after I retired from Forest Service, I was called back to Washington DC to receive an award as one of three people that had received that award. I was the third of over 100 year history of the Forest Service, in the category of organizational leadership. So that was a wonderful surprise, and I think one of the proudest moments. But I think that happened because of some of those values you're talking about. My loyalty, my dedication to outdoors, natural resources, water, the ways that I learned to work with people, because I transferred a lot. I was averaging a transfer to a different location, all beautiful places every 2.5 years, really, until I met you and then we stayed in one place longer, but I learned how to get along with people really well. I learned to be a harmonizer, I learned how to bring out the best in other people, I became a good supervisor, I received a lot of credit for being a good supervisor. I did that by bringing out the best in other people. I think if I had to narrow down to just a few little things, it would boil down to that, always in a professional setting, put myself second to the people that I'm serving. I have a little detour my own that I call it maintain a highly visible, low-profile. A highly-visible, low profile. People ask me, ""What does that mean?"" What it means is that I'm in the background most of the time. Observing, paying attention to what are going to be the needs of others or of the situation and kind of thinking ahead, here's how I would fix it. Here's what I can contribute, here's what I can address. Here's some talents that I have that would add to that. Then at the moment when you see it building into a real necessity, stepping forward and being there with the right skills, with the right attitude, with the right tools, and being part of the solution. A lot of people rush to be in the forefront, to be visible first and they burn out quickly. They don't have the staying power and I found that by being in the background.Patricia Chavez:	However, if I think back to the 26 years that I've known you, highly visible, low-profile hasn't obviously resulted in that, perhaps in your theme of that. But getting a Forest Service Chief's Award and you were one of three and the only Hispano and I know that you don't obviously consider the Hispanicness of yourself to be significant. I remember seeing you going across that stage as the only Hispano in that audience, thinking, ""This is Louis de Romero from Vadito, New Mexico, receiving that award.""Louis De Romero:	Yeah.Patricia Chavez:	I go back in memory the fact that now, as you've retired, now, what, 10 years?Louis De Romero:	12,13,14,15,16.Patricia Chavez:	Sixteen years from Forest Service and you've created your consulting business, still working with natural resource agencies. But primarily, if I go back now as your partner, as your sole [00:35:00] partner, I think of, ""Why am I most proud?"" Beyond the compassion and the sincerity and the obvious kindness that you emanate to your children, to other people around you is, my honey, Louis de Romero is being called upon at least twice a year still, to do Forest Service Chief's reviews across the country. So legacy wise, that's something that is pretty historical in Forest Service history in my mind and knowing Forest Service, having worked for them myself, what I would consider being one of the most significant feats.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, I agree. You're right. But my little theme of highly-visible low profile still applies even there because see, I never made a big issue about my Hispanicness, okay? I happened to be Hispanic, but I never made a big deal about that. So yeah, I was the only one there.Patricia Chavez:	Yeah.Louis De Romero:	But I came in at the right place at the right time and I became a role model for other Hispanics at the right place, at the right time with the high credibility. See, had I tried to make an issue of the fact that I was a Hispanic at a younger age, I may have burned out and not achieved anything.Patricia Chavez:	So if you look at all of that, I'm going to get to the one question. Do you feel that there's an afterlife? If so, what would you like to be able to project as lessons or.Louis De Romero:	Well, Patricia, that's a deep one. No, I don't believe in an afterlife, because I am a Christian, but I don't. But just in case, I try to believe my life in a way behaving in a good way so that just in case that will I go to heaven or I will come back as something favorable.Patricia Chavez:	So just in case, would you have done anything different in your life?Louis De Romero:	Like regrets, you mean? Or is that maybe? No, I've had a really good life. There's a few things I would have done a little different. I wouldn't have gotten married at such a young age the first time.Patricia Chavez:	Nor would you have married that first time.Louis De Romero:	Period. Those are your words.Patricia Chavez:	But then you wouldn't have the two children.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, I know. No my point is not so young. I didn't know what I was doing. It happened to result in two beautiful kids, yes. But I didn't know what married life was.Patricia Chavez:	That you had custody and raised.Louis De Romero:	Right, yeah. Afterwards. So that's one thing I would have done different. The other is that I would have gone and worked to Alaska when I was in my early 20s, and the other is that I would have traveled to Europe and South America and other places in the world before going to college. Before going to college. I wasted about three years of my first three colleges that I went to. I went to three different colleges three years in a row and got nothing out of it except bad grades.Patricia Chavez:	But it took you that long to get readjusted out of being at such an embryo stage in Vadito.Louis De Romero:	Yes, sure.Patricia Chavez:	That's my perception.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, I think so. But I think if I had traveled worldwide, I would have gotten a much wider learning perspective and I would have entered college much more prepared, I think. But it's still been a great life. It's been a good life.Patricia Chavez:	So if you were to say in that afterlife, if we're looking at, what would people say about Louis?Louis De Romero:	Here's what I would want them to say.Patricia Chavez:	Okay.Louis De Romero:	I would want them to say that I was somebody who was trustworthy all the time, that they could rely on me delivering what I promised. That's something I'm most proud of. I think that has served me well. Yes, maybe little disappointments, but mostly, I think that when I promise something, you can count on it and I would want to be known that way by other people, and follow through. It's what I tell my grand kids, I tell them, ""When you promise something, deliver and deliver it a little bit better than what others expect."" I think it's a great way to be and there's so much conflict in the world. Work towards harmony and peace, for crying out loud. There's plenty of bad stuff around us. We don't have to add to that. So I say that to my grand kids when they listen.Patricia Chavez:	Thank you, Louis.Louis De Romero:	[00:40:00] Yeah, this has been fun. Thank you, Patricia. Those are great questions, wow. Some of them are deep. Now, you're going to have me thinking from here on, some more about what's my life been all about?Patricia Chavez:	Hey, 70 years coming up.Louis De Romero:	Yeah, 69.Patricia Chavez:	Almost 70.Louis De Romero:	Yeah.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
MBY006645,"Elizabeth:	[00:00:00] My name is Elizabeth Gallegos. My maiden name was Silva. I am presently 62 years of age, and today's date is June the 19th of 2010. We are in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I will be interviewed by my son Joseph and my daughter Kimberlee.Kimberlee:	My name is Kimberlee Vigil. My maiden name is Gallegos. I am 39 years old. It's June 19, 2010. We're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I am interviewing my mom, along with my brother Joe.Joseph:	My name is Joseph Jerry Gallegos. I'm 43 years old. Today is June 19, the year 2010. We're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and we're interviewing our mom, Elizabeth Gallegos Silva.Kimberlee:	You want to start with your first question?Joseph:	Sure. I think, you know, given the background that we're asked to find out, I think it's a neat question to ask where you were born and when you were born. Where were you born?Elizabeth:	I was born here in Albuquerque and that was in 1946. I was born at St. Joseph's Hospital and grew up here in the Community of Barelas, which was probably one of the oldest Albuquerque communities. I'm happy that I'm here doing this in this neighborhood today.Kimberlee:	How would you describe yourself as a child?Elizabeth:	I was skin and bones [laughter] and pretty much I had a happy childhood. We had a lot of love in our household. I don't know if I can get through all of this.Joseph:	It's okay. You can.Elizabeth:	We didn't have a lot of money, but we had a lot of love in our household. And two brothers, an older brother and a younger brother. We played a lot outside and we went to the local schools here in our neighborhood, Coronado Elementary, and then Washington Junior High School, and then Albuquerque High School, where we all graduated. I think it was a fun childhood. It was a time in the history of Albuquerque that everybody played outside and every family took care of each other. So that's really different from what it is now.Joseph:	One of the things that I wanted to ask about is, you've been an important part of our lives growing up and stuff, who was important for you growing up and in your life? Obviously, your parents were there for you, but who else was in your growing up process that was family that nurtured you growing up?Elizabeth:	Well, I think in my childhood, we pretty much had a really extended family. But one of the big influences in my life was my mom's mom, my grandma, Rose Hill. She partially raised me. I lived with her for a long time, and she was a real independent woman way beyond the time of her age in life. At that time, women weren't independent, and I didn't get to see this part of her, but when she was a younger woman, she ran a boarding house for the men that worked on the railroad. She also owned a restaurant at one time and she was very strong. My mom, Lucille Travis Silva, also a strong woman. I think they were the big influences in my life. My dad was a calm young father and he died when I was only 18, but he influenced me a lot. He was very, very positive, as was my mom. I think they raised me with a real positive outlook on life, and I think that has been one of the driving forces for me to always stay positive and be strong in everything you have to do. I think that's where the influence came in. My aunt and uncle and our cousins, we all lived on the same property. So that was like a big extended family of brothers and sisters, since I only had two brothers, I value them and I think of them still as my brothers and sisters. [inaudible 00:04:50]Kimberlee:	Did you get into a lot of trouble when you were a teenager?Joseph:	[00:05:00] That was one of my questions too. I said every kid is mischievous. What was your moment that you always relish in knowing that you pulled off?Elizabeth:	I'm not so sure that I got in trouble with the law or anything like that. I never had anything like that occur, but I know that my friends and I, we used to do illegal drinking of alcohol. One of my friends would rip it off from her mom and we would take it to our football games or put it in our locker. We never got caught, luckily or thankfully, and we never got injured or harmed in any way by doing stupid things like that. But that was one of the things that we did, and we sometimes would stay out later than we were supposed to.I remember my mom used to like to play bingo a lot and this was before I was a teenager, maybe I was a preteen, and my brother Gino and I used to go with her to the bingos and we'd hang out outside with other kids whose parents were also playing bingo inside. I think it was the VFW Hall on Second Street, and one time it was late and we were still outside, and we were running around, and walking away from the property we were supposed to be staying at, and a cop car came and he put his in the backseat of his cop car. My brother and I, and we were freaking out, and he was asking us questions, what were we doing out at that hour and who were our parents? We thought he was going to take us to jail, and he just drove around the block and told us how dangerous it was for us to be out there at that time. So that was a big lesson in behaving and so that sticks in my mind forever.Joseph:	Was there anything in particular that you and your brothers used to do as a team together? Mischievous?Elizabeth:	Jerry was five years older than me so he didn't like to hang out with Gino and I. Gino and I are only a year apart so he and I used to just go play. I don't think we ever did anything mischievous, as in maybe stealing cokes out of a machine, we figured out how to jerry-rig it and we could get free cokes, but that's basically it. We were pretty good kids.Joseph:	Well, that's good. Growing up, I know that me and Kimberlee always had gave each other nicknames and our friends gave us nicknames. What was yours? How did you get it and from who?Elizabeth:	My nickname was Pudgy and we all know that pudgy means chubby, and of course, I was never chubby, so it didn't come from that. I was always really skinny when I was a kid. That came because I was told this, that I was conceived while my parents were in California, and they used to say that anyone that was either born or conceived in California were called pochos or pochas. So Pocha was also my nickname and they translated that to pudgy. My uncle Golly, who no longer is alive, he's the one that always called me pudge or pudgy, and uncle Eddie still calls me that sometimes, and so as my Nino, my uncle Freddie. But hardly anybody else knows that, and I don't share that very often either with my friends.Joseph:	That's funny.Kimberlee:	Did you enjoy going to school when you were growing up?Elizabeth:	I loved school. It was always a thing that I really enjoyed, being with friends. Cornado School, of course, all of my friends that lived in Barelas, we all went to the same school so we all grew up together going to the same schools. When we all went to Washington Junior high school, was a real revelation for me because we lived in Barelas, and just beyond, a few blocks from here is the Country Club, and when I met a lot of the Country Club girls, I was surprised and realized I didn't have all that they had; clothing and fancy houses. It was a real different experience, but they became really good friends with me and we grew up together as friends. But that was an interesting part of my life growing up, seeing the difference in our cultures and in our lifestyles. Then in Albuquerque High it was just a blast, we had so much fun there and we were very active in the clubs and in going to sporting events and that sort of thing. So it was a fun experience for me going through school.Joseph:	When you were growing up you were bilingual, you spoke Spanish and stuff, and right now it's a major player in how we grow up as adults. But you didn't teach us Spanish when we were kids, and I was just wondering why you chose to do that as opposed [00:10:00] to being raised bilingual yourself?Elizabeth:	Well, when I was little I lived like I said earlier a lot of years with my grandma and that was her language, so it was one of my first languages too, Spanish and English. But with grandma, I always spoke just Spanish, so that's how I came to learn it and then I would go to the El Rey Theatre with her to see the Spanish language movies on Sundays. When we were in school though, they wouldn't let us speak Spanish and I never understood that. They were very adamant about us just speaking English, so we were hindered. It wasn't until I became a young adult, even out of high school that I would get together with my high school friends that I had grown up with and we would speak in Spanish. It was a revelation that we all had felt the same way, that we weren't allowed to speak our language. So when you guys were born, your dad and I, your dad spoke fluent Spanish too, that was probably his first language also. We used to speak Spanish around you but we didn't force the issue to try to teach you how to do it, I think we encouraged you to take Spanish classes. I think when you were little we might have enrolled you in something I don't really remember.Kimberlee:	I did.Elizabeth:	You did, I thought so. But I knew that some of the opportunities that I missed on probably were because I was Hispanic. When I was graduating from high school and I was always in the honors classes and what they called accelerated at that time, maybe they call them something else now, enriched or gifted classes now. I was never asked by a counselor to come see them about how to apply for scholarships or grants or anything to go to college. So I always thought that because my parents couldn't afford to send me to college I couldn't go, so I wanted you all to have that opportunity. Now I wish you did speak Spanish and maybe you still can, it's never too late.Joseph:	Yeah, I agree. It's just something that it inhibits you from communicating with a lot of people and it feels weird when you just smile at them and just say basic stuff, there's no enriching bond with them that you could have. When I see you speak Spanish with people when we're out of town and stuff, it's just an experience that you're talking to somebody as a person and not just broken language.Elizabeth:	Yes, I understand that.Joseph:	But I guess in that learning process you were growing up, you had favorite teachers, maybe from childhood or in college growing up where you had some definitive moments with a particular professor, instructor. Is there anybody in particular help guide you through your growing up in the education process besides family?Elizabeth:	Well, in elementary school there was one teacher, Ms. Hudson, she was my fourth grade teacher, she was really hard on all of us but she really made us learn. I was sick during the course of my school year, but I remember her coming to my grandma's house to bring me work so I wouldn't get behind in school, I don't think teachers would ever do that now. Then Mr. Gregorio who was my sixth grade teacher, he was the very first man that had ever been a teacher for me, other than our arts and crafts teacher who was a native American, Mr. Gallegos was his name too. But Mr. Gregorio was handsome, and to me I just really loved being in his class and learned a lot from him. Then in high school, I don't know that I had one favorite teacher, one of my teachers I think when I was a sophomore, I can't remember her name. She was my history teacher, she had also been my mom and dad's teachers, so you can tell how old she was then. Then in college, I think Dr. Sam Roll.Kimberlee:	Dr. Roll.Elizabeth:	He's my favorite of all my college professors, he was my psychology professor and I learned a lot in his class. One thing, I'm not usually one of those people who's on time as you all well know, One time I went to his class late because it was an 8:00 class and to make an 8:00 class with two kids at home and going to school was hard to make. It was not an excuse because I would have probably been late if you hadn't been there either. But I got there a little bit late and he came and told me and he says, ""I tell everybody else here who's late [00:15:00] that if there's something more important you need to do in the morning, you should just take care of that or go to the Frontier and have a cup of coffee and relax, then go to your next class. But don't come in and disrupt the class."" That stayed with me for a long time, but I learned a lot in his class too and I still see him at the Frontier, and he always talks to me and he knows that he's my favorite.Kimberlee:	I used to love when you would take me with you to his classes because he was so funny.Elizabeth:	He was funny.Kimberlee:	He was great.Joseph:	Yeah, I had him as a professor too. Now, that we're thinking about good experiences in our life and doing things as a family, food is always a primary way for people to connect with our family. When you were growing up, what was the food that was the combo food to you and probably is still now?Elizabeth:	It's pretty much the same thing we still eat, beans and chili and enchiladas on Fridays, because we were raised Catholic. We never ate meat during lent especially on Fridays, so we always had enchiladas, cheese enchiladas without meat. So that's still it, a roast or a roasted chicken on Sundays was the big thing because we didn't eat a lot of meat during the week, because we couldn't afford it. I didn't know that, I just thought we ate pepitas and beans and chili and tortillas. My grandma used to do a lot of the cooking too for the whole family because for a while she lived with us at our house on Santa Fe that we still have, that I still own. Then later on when she got to go to her own apartment, she would still cook a lot for us and she made great biscuits from scratch and macaroni and cheese from scratch. There was no boxed stuff then, everything was made from scratch which is the best comfort food in the world.Joseph:	Yeah, you've made us lots of good comfort food.Kimberlee:	Yes.Elizabeth:	Tacos.Kimberlee:	Tacos.Elizabeth:	My mom's tacos, I can't forget that.Speaker_4:	Can you guys talk a little bit about the comfort foods that you really enjoyed growing up?Joseph:	Mom always cooked different things for us and I'm very grateful for that, that we always had a variety of things, but we also had the same foods that were comfort foods to her. In fact, I was listening to a tape the other day when we asked her what she was cooking for us in the kitchen, and she said, ""Carnitas, pepitas, and tortitas."" That was then I was 14 and Kimberlee was 11. Those elements of cuisine in our own family style, which are considered cuisine by other people from around the world are just basic staples at home. But we always had good things that came out of cookbooks or recipes. We learned to eat different cultural foods and spicy foods. We eat good meals all the time and ate vegetables and fruits and a lot of kids eat out of a box and we didn't, except for maybe cereal.Kimberlee:	There was just a lot of stuff that we got to eat, and were introduced to that our friends were like, ""What is that?"" They had no idea because they've never had it before. Even John, my own husband, had never tried several things that I now make for him because I grew up eating different stuff like that.Joseph:	That's true.Kimberlee:	You mentioned that on Fridays you didn't eat meat. You grew up Catholic. Did you go to church a lot as a child?Elizabeth:	Yes. We never missed Sunday mass. Of course, I went to catechism when I was little. I guess I was probably in the fourth grade and Gino was in his third grade. We went to catechism classes together and we made our first Holy Communions together. We used to go to all the holy day of obligation masses. All of the weddings of friends and family were in the Catholic Church. Same with funerals and rosaries and burials were all through the Catholic Church. So that was a big part of my life. My grandma used to pray the rosary every night and sometimes I would participate with her. She did it in Spanish and I didn't have always learn the whole rosary in Spanish, but I learned an important part of the rosary that way.Speaker_4:	Do you still remember it?Elizabeth:	How to say the rosary? Yeah, and I still say it periodically, mostly when I go to rosaries for somebody that's passed away. Yeah.Speaker_4:	Do you want to say just a few lines of what you used to say with your grandmother?Elizabeth:	""Padre, el nuestro, que estas en el cielo. "" She used to say, ""Te cuida las vacas y oye los becerros."" She used to make us laugh by teaching us how to [00:20:00] say the prayers. But we used to say that in Spanish, the whole rosary. After I got divorced, I pulled away from the Catholic Church for a while. I think I was angry with just life and didn't go to church or mass for a long time, and went to a different church, a non-denominational. Your dad was raised in a Catholic school and Catholic church too, and yet when we were married, he didn't like to go to mass. He said, ""Well, now I don't have to. I used to have to go when I was a kid and I don't have to so I'm not going to."" I kept pushing to want you guys to go to catechism to make your first Holy Communions and we just kept putting it off till you got to be so darn old. It was too late to do. So I'm glad that you did, Joe. Kimberlee, maybe someday you will too.Joseph:	That's a good accomplishment, and a much needed thing that I had growing up. I'm glad you were by my side to help me go through that process and I'm grateful. One of the things I'm grateful too is that you brought us into this world and I'm just wondering what you thought, when you found out that I was on the way and Kimberlee on the way. What went through your mind?Elizabeth:	Well, I'm sure you are aware of this, but you were conceived, Joe, before I was even married to your dad and we were just dating and stupid kids having premarital sex. You always think, ""It's not going to happen to me."" Well, it happened and I got pregnant. Your dad was as ecstatic as I was when we found out I was pregnant. My mom wasn't as ecstatic. My dad had already passed away. So I was there with my mom and Gino was still at home, I think. Maybe Jerry was still there too. I think Gino was the first one that I told that I was pregnant in the family and, he said, ""You need to tell mom, you need to tell mom."" I was terrified to tell her and I finally told her and actually, no, I didn't tell her. She came to me and said, ""You haven't had a period this month."" I said, ""Well, I'm not going to have one."" She says, ""What do you mean I'm going to have one?"" She was yelling at me. She was really furious with me and asked me to leave. So I did. I packed up my stuff and your dad and I found a little apartment. We went to Juárez and got married. It was crazy. Two friends went with us and they stood with us.Speaker_4:	Who went with you?Elizabeth:	It was Cressita and Rinaldo.Kimberlee:	I didn't know that.Joseph:	I didn't know that.Elizabeth:	They're are padrinos.Speaker_4:	Why did they come with you?Elizabeth:	They they had been there already. Well, wait a minute. I need to backtrack here. I'm trying to remember why they -- It wasn't Cressita and Rinaldo. It was my friend, Theresa Chavez and her boyfriend, George Chavez. I had dated George. I met your dad at TBI and George was going to TBI too. I had been dating both of them, but I really liked your dad much better. Anyway, they went with us because Theresa and George had gone to Juárez and gotten married on a dare.Kimberlee:	They knew where to go.Elizabeth:	They weren't really even dating that much and they know where to go. So they became our padrinos and that was that. I got married and then we went to the county clerk here and got our marriage license registered here so that it would be legal in New Mexico and be a legal marriage, and forever my mom wanted me to get married in the Church and make it right. But she pretty much disowned me for six months of my pregnancy. She wasn't involved with me. When Joseph was born, that was her baby boy.Kimberlee:	He's always her favorite.Elizabeth:	She half-raised you when you were just an infant and took care of you and everything was great after that. It was just a shock, I think, for my mom. Back then, girls didn't do that. It was an embarrassment to the family. Who's going to be peeking out of their curtain to see how big you're getting. That's why she didn't want me in the neighborhood. She just didn't want the neighbors to be talking about me. We got married in October, but she always celebrated my anniversary in August for years.Speaker_4:	What was it like for you as a young woman?Elizabeth:	Well, I felt very strange from my mom during that period when I first got pregnant. I thought, ""Who am I going to turn to?"" I was already working at TBI and Judy [Schmiderberg 00:24:48] who was there. She took me by the hand and she took me to her gynecologist. She's the one that was there when you were born with me.Kimberlee:	I never knew that.Elizabeth:	[00:25:00] Yeah.Kimberlee:	Wow.Elizabeth:	She made it less frightening for me. Auntie Annie also was there and she's the one that told me about a saddle block because I didn't know anything about how to have a baby. She gave me a lot of hints on how to take care of myself too.Kimberlee:	Did grandma come around before you had Joseph, or was it after he was born?Elizabeth:	It was after he was born, pretty much. Yeah. I went through pregnancy without much of her support, which was sad for me, but I was glad that it came around and turn out the way it did. Of course, my brothers were really supportive of me too.Kimberlee:	So then when you got pregnant with me, was I planned or was I a surprise?Elizabeth:	Well, it's very interesting because we always knew we wanted another child, at least one more, if not maybe a couple more. At the time I was taking birth control pills, and there was a lot of media hype saying how dangerous it was for women to be continuously taking the type of birth control pills I was taking at the time. There wasn't as much technology then, and so I got really scared and I thought I would lay off for a while. Well, it happened so fast. I was pregnant almost immediately after just stopping the pill. When you were born and we had our boy and our girl, that was a perfect family for us. So you were not planned, but then we were really happy. We never checked for either of you as to what your gender was going to be when I was pregnant. We were surprised both times and happily so.Joseph:	One of the happy things that I remember and very vividly growing up was you singing to me before I go to bed. Where did you learn all that silly songs that we used to sing?Elizabeth:	I don't know, some of them were made up and some of them were just songs that I remember from my own childhood or nursery rhymes or whatever. I sang to both of you. I sing to Kimberlee's babies too. My mom always was singing and we sang a lot in our house. I mean, we used to have the song books of lyrics of the old '50s and '40s songs. We used to open a book and point at it and then we had to sing it. We always sang with the radio. That was just part of me as an adult too, and we still sing together, all of us.Joseph:	Like Las Mañanitas at birthdays.Elizabeth:	Yes.Speaker_4:	Do you want to sing a little bit of one of the family songs that you really like?Elizabeth:	Probably not going to be able to do it impromptu.Joseph:	Yeah. If I hear the beginning of it. There was three men in the boat.Kimberlee:	That's funny.Joseph:	Those are songs that mom sang to us all before we go to bed. It was pretty cool. As we grew up, and Dad and you went through hell with us as teenagers. I guess we made it through that gauntlet of all of us being together. What were some of the most challenging things for you dealing with us growing up?Elizabeth:	Well, I don't think it was so horrible as you just described. It was stressful. Raising teenagers is very hard. I think I always worried about you both as you started to grow away, as you grow up, which is a logical transition and growing up process. I used to feel very worried and very afraid because I wasn't there to take care of you if something were to happen. But I had to trust that I had raised you sufficiently to be responsible and be able to take care of yourselves. But I guess when Kimberlee started dating, I think I was really worried all the time that she was with some boy because I knew what I did when I was a teenager. I would worry that she'd be out there doing things that maybe she shouldn't be. With you, Joe, I think every time you would play football or wrestle and I'd see maybe an injury starting to happen, I would just freak out. I just was out of control then. [00:30:00] But both of you were really good kids. The one thing, Joe, I remember when you and Keith stayed out all night and got rip-roaring drunk. I didn't know where you were, and you didn't come home. Then, when you finally came home, you were sicker than a dog and we just let u be sicker than a dog as your lesson.Kimberlee:	I remember dad watching and laughing while he threw up.Elizabeth:	I never had to call the cops or the cops call me. I think when you were in that accident with your friend, Joseph, and that was the only time they called and said, ""Ms. Gallegos, is your son Joseph Gallegos? Well, we have him here. He's been in an accident."" Or, ""Ms. Gallegos, this is the principal at Jefferson. Kimberlee has been kissing in the hall. You need to come get her."" It wasn't very serious trouble that you were in, but it was stressful. Then, of course, when your dad left the household and I had to raise you on my own, at that period of time was probably the worst. I know it was hard on you too, and we made it.Kimberlee:	We did.Joseph:	Yeah. That's a good thing that we've made it all this far. I'd have to say that we've all lived a great life and stuff. I was just wondering what would be if you had to build your top five moments in life that were pivotal in you growing up that you would say that anybody that listens to this CD in the archives would know five things in your life would be. It's hard to do general things, but I don't think we have enough time to do all of that.Kimberlee:	Wow. That's a big one.Joseph:	If you started maybe from --Elizabeth:	When I was a little girl? I guess when I was a little girl, one of the things -- I never quite understood why I had to go live with my grandma. My mom would drop Gino and I off sometimes in the summer when we weren't in school to stay with grandma. But then my mom would come home from work and pick up Gino, and he'd get to go home with her to where my dad and Jerry were and I stayed with my grandma. I remember just crying my heart out because I didn't understand that, and nobody ever explained it to me. They just said, ""Well, grandma needs a companion and we want you to be with her.""Elizabeth:	Well, our house wasn't very big. I still have that house. It looks pretty much the same way it did, although it's been rehabilitated to code now. But it just had two bedrooms, and that little living room, and a kitchen, and one bathroom. There would be no place for me. My brothers shared a bedroom and my mom and dad had the other bedroom. I basically stayed with grandma. I think that's one thing that stays in my head. But I learned a lot from my grandma. The strength I have as a woman, I think I learned from her too. She always put jewelry on, and always combed her hair, and always dyed her hair, and so I still do all that too. Rose Hill still lives in my heart and in my soul.Elizabeth:	Then, as a teenager, I guess, when my dad died, I was only 18. That was a turning point in my life too. He didn't live long enough to meet you guys. He would have loved you. He loved kids. His discipline to us was to get his handkerchief and spank us with it. He'd say, ""Come here, I'm going to spank you,"" and he just hit us the handkerchief. Of course, that didn't do anything, but we knew he loved us and he was trying to make sure we behaved. Then, as an adult, I guess my divorce was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through in that part of my life. Then, Kimberlee got pregnant and she wasn't married. I thought, ""Oh, the cycle continues here."" I just love all my grandsons. She's given me five beautiful grandsons and I love them all. Joseph, when you were so sick. I'm just happy that you're healthy now. But we've been through a lot together through that, mijito. A lot of faith, a lot of prayers, faith in our family, faith in God, and faith in sticking together has really pulled us through everything we've had to deal with. I hope that carries through in your lives as you grow up further into your life and old age.Joseph:	Yeah. That's one thing that I truly cherish because I look at my friends and people that I know that have no concept of how strong our family is, our tight family as well as our extended family, and how much love there is. I'm so grateful that we have what we have. A lot of people don't have that blessing. It's pretty special the way you've raised us and taught us a lot [00:35:00] of things in life.Elizabeth:	I hope I've been able to extend that, Kimberlee, to Derek and Jeremy now that they're young men starting out in the world, and eventually, to Johnny, and Andrew, and Antonio. The love of family. I think it's important that we continue to nurture all the gatherings that we do together as a family and our extended family too. We start and end with family.Kimberlee:	Yeah.Elizabeth:	I hope none of us ever forget where we came from. That's always been my motto.Joseph:	That's a special thing that we're doing here today. The whole world can listen to it if they choose to. We'll always be able to have that record of what we've done today.Elizabeth:	I remember when Derek was I think in junior high school, he interviewed me. I was living in the apartment down Colombia.Joseph:	Yeah, I remember that.Elizabeth:	He was surprised, because I told him -- He asked me, ""What was it like growing up when you were a kid?"" I said, ""Well, we didn't have color TV. We didn't have digital phones. We didn't have cell phones. We didn't have microwaves. We didn't have any of those things that you just take for granted."" It was like a light bulb going up in his head. He was totally surprised. In some ways, innocence is lost now because of so much technology and what they see on TV and on YouTube, and everything else that happens in their lives. It's just not as innocent as when I was growing up. Even when you were growing up, it was a little more innocent time in the world.Joseph:	Yeah. I think it changed a lot when cable TV came to be and CNN shows everything up close.Elizabeth:	Yes. In history times, I guess when I was in high school was when President Kennedy was assassinated. I remember exactly where I was, and how I heard it, and what we did after that happened. That was a pivotal time in my life in terms of world history, and was living history. He was the first real president that I loved and thought he was hope for us. When he was assassinated, we all cried. We sat glued to the TV and cried as a family.Joseph:	What things have made you cry as happiness, though?Elizabeth:	When you guys were born, the minute I saw your faces, I was crying. I was so happy to see both of you when you were born and the babies too, Kimberlee's babies. I think with birth of our family members and now we have a new one, Gino's new little baby granddaughter. I can't wait to meet her, but that's always been a big joy, tears of happiness. When you graduated from high school, both of you. And I cry for everything, really. You know that. Everything that you guys do that make me laugh or happy, I cry. It's just a show of emotion.Joseph:	We've talked about all these little elements of life in such a short amount of time. If there was a song that could be your song for your life. Of all the songs that you've heard, is there anything that would be mom's song or something?Elizabeth:	That's a hard one.Joseph:	I mean there's so many songs.Elizabeth:	Your dad and I had a song and you know that, Kimberlee, ""Colour My World."" That's still an important song in my life. ""You Are My Sunshine."" I used to sing that to both of you. My mom use to sing that to me.Kimberlee:	I sang it to the boys when they were babies.Elizabeth:	Of course, ""Las Mañanitas"" which is a real celebratory song for us, for our families, and I guess maybe those are the ones. I love music, I love all kinds of different songs, but those are the ones that stick out the most.Speaker_4:	Can I ask you a quick question? If you want to pass on something to future generations of your family to know about your mother, what things would you want them to know?Kimberlee:	That she's amazing, she's just got such strength and faith. She's just always been there no matter what.Joseph:	Yeah. We've put her through the test of motherhood and she's always come out with flying colors. I mean, she's a tough, strong woman that's taught that toughness and strength to us. But also the peacefulness that you can have. The belief in knowing that your family is always there and the good things in life too, about knowing when it's time [00:40:00] to work and knowing when it's time to rejoice and have fun and get together and eat, and we still do all those things. If it's anything that we can share with somebody else, it would be to maintain those levels of happiness and trust in your family and knowing that there's that love that's always going to be there, and the positive way of looking at things and to be strong and believe in yourself as we do in each other. It's been a good life for all of us as far as those aspects go. And sometimes there are speed bumps that we have to jump over. But we're still smooth and riding down the highway of life and more things to come that are good, and we're glad our mom's with us the whole way. Is there anything that you think that we should take from you? I mean, we're adults now, and we've learned a tremendous amount of stuff, but we haven't reached the time in your life now where you're getting ready to enjoy the retirement and you get that taste of being a kid again, because you won't have to do a lot of the grind of --Elizabeth:	Daily work?Joseph:	Daily work. You'll always be a mom and you'll always be worried about us and the grand kids. But there's this time in your life now that you're about ready to move on to the next level. I don't know.Elizabeth:	Well, I'm looking forward to that and relaxing and getting to spend time with the three younger grandsons. I spend a lot of time with Derek and Jeremy and with Johnny, Andrew, and Antonio. It's been here and there. But maybe retiring, I can spend a little more time with them, but I just want you to never forget that you need to stay connected to family whenever you can as much as possible. We have a huge family in California that we don't get to see as often, and there's a lot of cousins that you probably have never even met, same on your dad's side. And at some point you need to stay connected however you can and just be strong in your beliefs and in your love for each other and for your family and in life. Enjoy life and be happy and always stay positive because life is what we all have made it and made it together, and I think we've had a joyful life and we've done a lot of fun things together. We continue to do that and certainly this is a big part of one of those fun things that I never thought that we could ever do, and wish we had more time and could include other family members and maybe we should do that on our own.Elizabeth:	We should think about that because I wish I had asked my grandma more questions, but when she died, I was just a kid and she has a lot of history that I never got to know. She was, I would say, the [inaudible 00:43:13] of sorts and I didn't get to explore all that. Your grandma and my mom, same, I think she had the same. They could read the cards and do all that sort of thing. Although you and Kimberlee and I, Joseph, have a lot of intuition between the three of us, and I think that stems a lot from that dynamic that my mom and grandma had. Then of course, when my mom passed away six years ago, was very difficult for me and I always had a tough relationship with my mom. But I think as I became a young woman, I was able to move past a lot of the things that happened that made it difficult, and I hope I haven't made it too difficult for you all.Joseph:	Not at all.Elizabeth:	That we can continue to enjoy life together as I get viejita.Joseph:	I don't think you're going to be that either. You're pretty much a go-getter person like the rest of the people in our family. I think we all know how to live life to the fullest and believe in God, and I think that helps keep us all strong. And we all believe in each other and love each other, and it's pretty special to share this.Elizabeth:	Well, there's no greater love than being a mommy to you two. I love you more than anybody in the world.Joseph:	Yeah, we love you too, mom.Kimberlee:	We love you too.Elizabeth:	From the deepest part of my heart.Joseph:	It's good energy.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
MBY006647,"Caroline Ramos:	[00:00:00] I am Sylvia Caroline Ramos. I go by Caroline, I always have. I'm 39 years old, and today is June 19th, 2010. We're in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I'm here with my mom who is going to introduce herself.Marina Ramos:	Hello, I'm Sylvia Marina Ramos. I say the Marina because all the girls in my family, starting with me, nieces, daughters, sisters, are also named Sylvia. So that identifies me as the first one. I am 63 years old. Today is June 19, 2010. We are in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I'm here with my daughter Caroline.Caroline Ramos:	Mom, why did you want to do this?Marina Ramos:	Well, I have been hearing the StoryCorps project for many years and I've always thought it's a good idea because everything in the world, people, rocks, animals, everything, has a story. Even though humans are really the only ones who can tell the story with words. It doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor,  young or old, learned or not, even whether you're an ethical person or person we would consider bad. We all have a story to tell. I think that if that story has one thing in it that touches somebody's life in a way, as to perhaps make it better. It's an important thing to do. So telling our stories, I think is an important part of being who we are and doing what we're supposed to do, which is to help each other through.Caroline Ramos:	Is this something that you see Santiago, your grandson, listening to?Marina Ramos:	Oh, yes. We already tell stories. I mean, I've told the same story of Jack and the Beanstalk almost every morning for six years, when he stays over on Fridays, and it's always a different story. Obviously Jack can be a little boy on his own or a little boy with his dog or a boy who's just kicking stones outside. Yeah, I think storytelling is important, and I see that as part of a tradition, whether it's a written story or the oral story, yes.Caroline Ramos:	As you know, of course, I am a Nuyorican, and I was born in New York, and I have two Puerto Rican parents. You were born in Puerto Rico, which I think is a very different experience growing up, I'm sure. As a Puerto Rican from the island, Do you consider yourself an immigrant?Marina Ramos:	Yes, I do because even though Puerto Rico has been a part of the United States, and Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since 1898. Coming to the mainland from the island was a totally foreign experience for me. It meant a totally different environment, climate, language, culture, a way of life. So yes, I think I have lived the immigrant experience and I think because of that, I've been able to do a lot of things that perhaps some of the Puerto Ricans born in the mainland haven't been able to do because they've had other issues to deal with.Caroline Ramos:	Like what?Marina Ramos:	Well, for one, when I came to New York, I was already 12 years old. I lived in Puerto Rico. Everybody was Puerto Rican. Nobody looked down on you. Of course, there's always all kinds of prejudices in any society, but we were all the same. So I grew up thinking of myself as an average person and part of the community. Puerto Ricans in New York who were born there, many times developed the sense that they were not as good as the rest of the people. They were discriminated against. They were marginalized, and in fact, in many ways still are. So they sometimes grew up with the sense that they're not as good as someone else and that limits their ability to move forward, I think. That did not happen to me because I had a totally different sense of myself, even though I did face discrimination in a lot of different ways. I was already 12 years old. My sense of self, I think was in a lot of ways established.Caroline Ramos:	I heard Santiago tell a friend of his the other day that his amah is a doctor. I immediately started crying, because to have a child, an African American and Puerto Rican child, say that his grandmother is a doctor [00:05:00] is pretty phenomenal. I would like you to talk a little bit about how that came to be.Marina Ramos:	Well, that's something that happened I think that might not have happened had I remained on the island. Traditionally, women on the island got married, had children. If they did go to work and they became teachers and nurses perhaps. But when I came to New York, there was no family around. We did have an aunt who was in Manhattan, but we really never saw her. We did have relatives in Washington DC, but we didn't see them. So when we came to New York, my mother, my three sisters, and I and because my father was no longer present there all the time, we were a unit. So I had to figure out my way in the world in a lot of ways. I was the caretaker. I became the caretaker of my sisters. I also I think have always been surrounded by children who are in pain, in one way or another. I think that made me develop this sense of wanting to help people. Luckily, I was good in science, so that sort of tied in. So when I was in high school, they gave us an aptitude test and I did well in all areas. Sorry, I'm not tooting my horn, but I did. But science also and mathCaroline Ramos:	This is the time.Marina Ramos:	Science and Math which we're not the traditional fields for girlsCaroline Ramos:	Sure.Marina Ramos:	So I went to the library. You see, I've always been this focused person. I went to the library and I looked up careers in math and science. There was a researcher there and that seemed okay. There was science teacher and my father was a teacher and I didn't think I wanted to teach. There was nurse, but then was also doctor, and to me I've always liked being the eldest daughter in the family, always telling my sisters went to do, I've always liked telling people what to do and doctors tell people what to do. Of course, they do it in a different way, but to me, that seemed like an attractive career. So I decided that's what I'm going to do. Since I didn't have any money, I depended on scholarships and loans. But I got to college and right away became a pre-med. Unfortunately, when I went to speak to the pre-med advisor, probably halfway through my college career, he tried to dissuade me from going into medicine. I don't think he probably thought a Puerto Rican girl going into medicine from the Bronx. I don't know what he thought, but I just never went back to him. I found supportive teachers who didn't seem like that was something I couldn't do. So luckily, I got into medical school in New York.Lily:	Before you move on can I ask you a question about that?Marina Ramos:	Yes.Lily:	What did he say to you? Do you remember?Marina Ramos:	Well, I think he said that I didn't have the grades, which to some extent is true because I didn't have a four-point index. I didn't have even a 3.5 Index. My index, I think in college at the end was 3.25, which I guess if you know about getting into medical school on those days, it took a lot more than that. But he didn't bother to talk to me about what my dedication was, what my interest was. I was a student, was commuting from home, and had other kinds of pressures in my life. None of that was investigated, solely that you didn't think I should go to medical school.Lily:	I'm sorry.Marina Ramos:	Yes.Lily:	Do you remember what you thought when he said that? What went through your head?Marina Ramos:	Well, I felt badly, of course, because this is what I was focused on. But I never thought, no, I'm not going to do this, I just thought, well, I'm not going to come back to him again. I have a friend actually, who is just slightly older than I am, who is also a Puerto Rican woman, who when faced with the same kind of a situation, decided that she would go into nursing. She did actually, and she was a great nurse and she got to be the top nurse in the hospital, but then decided that there was no reason why she shouldn't go into medicine, but she was already around 32, which happily was okay. I actually interviewed her, as I was on the faculty of Albert Einstein at that point, I was on the admissions committee, on a committee that looked at the applications for minority students and students from [00:10:00] under-represented groups in medicines such as African Americans, Puerto Ricans from the mainland, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, that looked at those groups and it so turned out that she was one of the students who came through that admissions committee, so I interviewed her for medical school and she became a doctor, and now she's one of my very best friends. Not only did she become a doctor, she was a family practitioner, she's boarded in that and then she had boards in OB-GYN. Here's a woman who was discouraged from going into medicine for whatever reason when she was young, and yet when she was older went through medicine and has done very well. This is turning out to be a long conversation, so in medical school I loved everything, but I really enjoyed surgery. I knew I didn't want to take care of children, I don't like seeing children in pain, I don't like poking and prodding them, so pediatrics was not for me. I like psychiatry, in fact, I still like psychiatry, the whole idea of exploring the mind and being able to help people with mental problems that are debilitating, but I love surgery and so I went into that. Again, the first day that I was in surgery rotation, one of the attending surgeons came over to me and said, I think he was trying to be helpful, he said to me, ""Sylvia, because you're a woman, you have to work twice as hard as the men to be able to be thought of as just doing your work."" I looked at him, he was obviously taller than I was, and I looked at him and I smiled and I said, ""That won't be hard."" That's what I did, and I've loved being a surgeon. I love being that kind of a doctor. I've always loved being a doctor.Caroline Ramos:	I remember you became chief surgical resident.Marina Ramos:	Yes.Caroline Ramos:	I was maybe five or six years old when that happened, and I'd never really comprehended what that meant, especially in 1978 when it happened. But I remember we were living over there on Matthew's Avenue, I remember you were wearing that hideous gray fur coat, remember? It wasn't real fur, it was foe, fur, and you were wearing it and you just ran down the street and ran up the stairs and, ""I'm made chief resident."" You were so excited and I had no idea what that meant. But I'll never forget when you came home and told me that, and then years later, I thought my God, that was mid to late '70s. This little Puerto Rican lady was a surgeon. All doctors are incredible professionals, but there's something about surgeons that strikes me as the height of control and the height of command, and prestige, and education, and skills. I've always had that memory and I've always thought about that, and I've always bragged to people that you were the chief resident. Do you think that being a doctor is who you are or what you do?Marina Ramos:	Well, I'm glad you remember that scene. I've totally forgotten it, but he was obviously a very important time in my life. The surgical programs were pyramidal, they started out with a bunch of people at the bottom, but then when you got to the last year, probably four people got to do that, and I was one of those. So for me it was a very important time and sounds like it was a memorable experience for you also.Caroline Ramos:	We had pizza, we had to celebrate that night I remember.Marina Ramos:	Terrific.Caroline Ramos:	In front of the TV, which you never let me do.Marina Ramos:	I know. Was that the 13-inch black and white?Caroline Ramos:	Yes.Marina Ramos:	That you had all through your childhood and adolescence?Caroline Ramos:	Yes, and you will remind me that it did not hurt me any.Marina Ramos:	It didn't, I'm amazed you watched as much TV as you did. Yes, it is who I am. I think of myself as a caretaker, I have thought of medicine as a vocation, it's a calling, it's what I do, and that is, I think, the way it should be. However, in the way in that it isn't so good is that the families of doctors who believe as I do, are sometimes neglected because surgery, especially, is just a lifelong [00:15:00] occupation. I remember working over 100 hours per week, and you know what, I don't begrudge that. I had to develop the skills with which to help people, and you can't do that on a part-time basis. But exactly, that's what happened to me on September 11th, when I was in the shower listening to the shower radio, it was six o'clock, our time here. I heard on the news about what was going on in New York, and as soon as I got out of the shower, I went and turn the turn the TV on, CNN of course, and I was horrified. I wanted to stay home, but I had an office full of patients who came from all over the state to see me, and I couldn't stay home. I went to work and I remember feeling so badly. It wasn't the patients' faults, they should expect me to be there. But I said to myself, this is what I've always done with family things, personal things aside, for the sake of my job, my vocation. At that point, I decided I didn't want to do it as intensely as I used to.Caroline Ramos:	I think that's a really nice segue into some of the other areas that I wanted to explore with you, which were motherhood and how you came to be a mother, and the timing of which was not ideal. Obviously, I'm talking about having been basically born when you were in medical school, and I want to explore that a little bit. I want to ask you, can you talk about family and how the families of surgeons, in particular, get neglected. How did you discover that you are going to become a parent?Marina Ramos:	Well, having biological children was never one of my goals because I had this career, this vocation, and I knew that there wasn't a lot of space there for children. Also, I had seen women that I'd grown up with having children and then having to find their way in the world, taking care of those children. Thirdly, I had been taking care of my sisters as it were, and then seeing some of my other relatives have difficult times and so bearing my own child was not what I had in mind. But the universe figures out the best way to do things and to show us the way and so the universe presented you to me. When it did, I thought, ""Boy, this is a hard thing that I'm going to do,"" but I proceeded. If I had not done that, I don't think I would have been able to be the kind of person I am now. I don't think I would have learned a major lesson in life that has to do with how to look beyond yourself and beyond your own life to the next life. I'm grateful to the universe for having presented you to me.Caroline Ramos:	I think that in the interest of, for me, a full disclosure for the people that are going to be hearing this in the future, I'm actually the biological daughter of your baby sister who was murdered and who asked you. Probably right when I was born, if you would take care of me, if anything should happen to her and you did even though you were in the middle of medical school, you just started medical school, I think and you took that time off to be with me for nine months. I was four months old when she was murdered.Yes, you're right about the universe, you are. Having been thrown into [00:20:00] motherhood almost, it sounds like it's something that you have found fulfilling.Marina Ramos:	Well, it is the hardest job anyone ever does. I could do surgery standing on my head, believe me, I'd do the knives, the whole thing. It's hard to be a parent and I believe that it is the number 1 job in the world because children are the future. Children are what will protect the universe from all kinds of catastrophes. Not only this generation, but maybe a generations 100 years from now. I do believe being a parenting is the number 1 job in the world and I might not have understood that had I not been a parent. I think teaching is the second job in the world, because when children aren't at home, they're in school and hopefully with good teachers. The other thing I find as I get older, and especially since my mom died in August, is all kinds of things come to your mind. I've been sort by all of the ways in which my mother affected my life that I never even thought of and might not even have respected in a way. When I find myself dressing sometimes I'll say, ""Here I'm dressing like mom."" The good thing about her is that she was always neat and tidy. I might not choose her style but she always took pride in her appearance. When I find myself saying to myself, well books are very important and they always have been important to me but other lessons have to be learned that don't come out of books. I hear my mother, ""Don't keep your nose in the books all the time. You can't learn life from books."" That's true. The other thing I learned from my mom is the sense of trying to help other people. Maybe if she hadn't died, well if she hadn't been sick over time, I never appreciated those things when I was young that I appreciate now. Mothering is like a lifetime endeavor and even when you're dead, she's still around and in a lot of ways. I'm very grateful to be a mother and to be your mother.Caroline Ramos:	I miss grandma. I miss her.Marina Ramos:	To be your mother in particular and I'm glad that you have with son. Who I never again expected. It's the non-expected gift to me and I am very fortunate to have you both. I thank you for him and for you.Caroline Ramos:	The feeling is very mutual. You talked about how many hours you worked, and how hard that was, and as a working mom myself and as a newly single working mom, it's another lesson that I had no concept of. Another area I had no concept of. When I was married to Santiago's father, I always had help, I always had backup and I could work as late as I needed to work and I could take care of everything. I'm really awestruck by how you did it. I don't even work the hours that you worked. It's very different. I think the work that you and the women that came behind you did helped women like me. I'm an attorney, I work hard, but I also try to balance my life and in order to be with Santiago. Do you think as you look back that you would change any of the ways that you raised me or any of the choices that you made as when I was younger?Marina Ramos:	Well, it's hard, it's always easy to speak in retrospect.Caroline Ramos:	Hindsight 20/20.Marina Ramos:	But what I believe, I have given you, and what I think every parent wants to give their child, is the benefit of their example. Love and the very best education they can handle. Because if you give a child those three things, they will make their own way in the world. I was the very strict parent. We talked about the 13 [00:25:00] inch TV and the fact that you could only watch it half an hour a day, and I did work a lot, and one thing I've always admired about you is that you have always had a balance to life. Whether it was school and social life, work and social life, and that was something that I never really saw because I've been like a horse with blinders. I'm going to medical school and this is how I'm going to do it, and I take on this job and that's how I'm going to do it. The other part, the social part or the more personal things, haven't been as easy for me to manage. So I admire the balance you have in life, but I think I probably would do things very much the same way except perhaps take a little more time off?Caroline Ramos:	That's fair.Marina Ramos:	Thank you.Lily:	Can I ask you a question?Marina Ramos:	Yes.Lily:	So Sylvia when the universe presented you with Caroline, what kind of a support system did you have to be going through your medicine career and have a daughter?Marina Ramos:	Luckily, I had my mother. I was married at the time and I had sisters, one of whom was very good to Caroline. She would take her over to her house and spend the night with her and my mom, so that was really the support system. Mothers always seem to be there, one way or another, and I was going to say, maybe I'll have a question for you Carol.Caroline Ramos:	Okay.Marina Ramos:	What do you think I should have done differently in raising you?Caroline Ramos:	Again, hindsight is 20/20. As I look back on my childhood, I don't feel as though you were absent. I've never felt that before. I might though think of one or two events, that I probably held over your head a million times. You didn't go to see me in the chorus, or whatever it was. But I really do not ever, when I think back on my childhood, I don't ever perceive you as being absent. What I probably do differently now with Santiago, based on that is, I think-- I don't think it harms me at all but I was definitely left on my own a lot. I felt like I was fending for myself a lot and not necessarily because you were absent. I think that you were always around, but I feel like you wanted me to be independent and you wanted me to be tough and brave and do stuff and go grocery shop, and go do the laundry, and here's the Y. Find the bus and the bus will be there to pick you up and go there and go to skating, and I found my way, and it made me have to ask questions, ask people for help, talk to grown ups, and say, ""Where does the Y bus pick me up,"" or ""Where is this?"" Now sometimes when I think, I drop Santiago off at his first day of camp, and I told you I thought it was chaos. I said, ""How's my little baby going to get from this place, this end of prep to the other end of prep, and who's going to hold his little hand?"" and I thought to myself, My mom said, 'go find the bus'"" and I think there's good and bad to that. I think the good part is it made me, I think, I feel like wherever I am, I belong there and I can find my way anywhere and I can talk to anybody and I can walk up and say ""I need to get here or I need help"" and I can stick up for myself. But on the other hand I felt like I wasn't, coddled is not the right word, but I felt like I was kind of thrown into the world a little bit and that I would have done differently. I do differently with Santiago and I don't want to coddle him. On one hand, I sometimes think to myself, ""This kid needs to get toughened up. When I was little, my mom,"" and I hear myself saying that sometimes, but then I look at him and I say, ""No he's too little."" But I think that it also made me, it's a big part of who I am today.Marina Ramos:	That is true and I think that's fair, and the good thing is that you have learned from [00:30:00] my limitations and to do it differently for your child.Caroline Ramos:	I disagree with the characterization of it as a limitation. I just think that's what we do. I mean, that's how we survive.Marina Ramos:	That's true.Caroline Ramos:	I think that, another thing that I do in front of Santiago is I cry in front of him. When I'm in pain, I cry in front of him, and sometimes I agonize and I think I'm damaging this kid. He's going to think my mother was the biggest cry baby, and on the other hand, I have people say, no he's going to see you as human and alive, and vulnerable, and that's okay too. So I don't think it's a limitation. I think we do what we have to do to cope and to survive.Marina Ramos:	True. I as a surgeon, I've always been very controlled. Perhaps controlling but certainly controlled.Caroline Ramos:	I said I would cry for both of us today, right? I have.Marina Ramos:	Yes.Caroline Ramos:	I've not disappointed.Marina Ramos:	No, people when I was working in the operating room, would know that when things were going the worst, I would get very quiet and very methodical. I'm not the person to jump up and down and shout and carry on. But it doesn't mean that I don't feel it inside. It's just that I have a different way of coping with it, but I think that's what's good for Santiago. He sees different women who are very important to him do things differently, and they both love him.Caroline Ramos:	Absolutely. Mom, where do you think we will be in 10 years or 20 years?Marina Ramos:	In 20 years, I'm going to be 83 years old and Santiago will be 26, hopefully finished with college and graduate school and making his way in the world wherever that is or maybe not. He might have decided to take a break from college and travel the world and learn. I mean, it's so wonderful that we all have such different possibilities, and you know, I'm a world traveler, so if he takes after that, that would be terrific. When I'm 83, well, I don't think I will be working even part-time.Caroline Ramos:	Good.Marina Ramos:	I will be working in the garden. I love to garden. Both my grandfathers were farmers, small farmers, small store owners in Puerto Rico. I have the green farm. Santiago and I love going in the backyard and in the planting boxes. So I'll be gardening. I'll be writing poetry, which I've started to do. I'll be paying attention to family, nieces, nephews and also hopefully still traveling the world, and also, of course, taking time to be with friends.Caroline Ramos:	Good. That's really important.Marina Ramos:	Yes, I think that is true. Where do you think you're going to be 10 or 20 years from now?Caroline Ramos:	I'll still be working unless I hit the lottery. I'll still be lawyering. I hope I'll still be at the same firm because I love the people there, even though the politics aren't always good. But I hope that Santiago will be in the same-- I just want him to be happy and confident and safe and a contributor.Marina Ramos:	I think he will be.Caroline Ramos:	Yeah.Marina Ramos:	I don't think there's any doubt about that.Caroline Ramos:	No. I think that that's true. I think he's going to be okay, and I always say he's the greatest thing I ever did and he will be as always. I'm grateful to you for asking us to do this. For as Lily said, dragging me in here. I was glad to do it, and I'm really I'm really grateful to you for asking us to do it. I think it is important for Santiago and for his children and so on and so on. I'm really grateful and I'm really looking forward to doing this with him someday.Marina Ramos:	Good.Caroline Ramos:	I'm seeing what he has to say about the universe and how it's all worked out. I'm grateful that you asked me to do it and I'm grateful that you're in my life and that as tragic as they were, that circumstances brought us together somehow. Even when we bud heads.Marina Ramos:	Especially then. There are many lessons to be learned from the budding of heads.Caroline Ramos:	That's true.Marina Ramos:	Yes.Caroline Ramos:	Do you have anything else? It looks like we're running out of time, but [00:35:00] do you have anything else that you want to say?Marina Ramos:	Well, how do you think being a Puerto Rican New Yorker affected your life?Caroline Ramos:	I was not the typical Puerto Rican New Yorker, and I think that it was a very strange upbringing in that I was raised in the Bronx, where all the Puerto Ricans were. But I was raised in Riverdale, where there weren't a lot of Puerto Ricans because I had a mother who worked her ass off for me to be privileged, and so I was a little different. I was a Puerto Rican who I didn't live in the projects like my best friend Cindy did. I went to museums and to the opera, and I had books and shoes and toys, and I went on vacation and I got to go to private school and we didn't have to worry about it. I never heard you worrying about money or I never was raised with that. But I was still brown, very brown. But I was too brown to blend into or assimilate into white culture. But I was too privileged, according to some of my friends in college, to really be down and understand what was going on with issues of poverty and being Latino and in a world of poverty. I think that it's a very unique situation. I am supremely proud of being Puerto Rican. There's something about Puerto Ricans no matter where they are, that when they see each other, when I used to have the Boricua license plate, people would beep at me or honk at me here in New Mexico, wherever I was driving. There's a real sense of pride no matter where you're from, whether you're from the island, people want to know where's your family from? ""Oh the Isabela, Oh the Bayamon, Oh the Catano.""  I love that. I love it.Marina Ramos:	Well, I have always been proud of the fact that, especially when you went to college, you then identified with the students of color and became an activist there and contributed and have contributed ever since to making the world maybe a more just world for people of all kinds.Caroline Ramos:	I hope so. I mean, I definitely come from a different place, but I think all good people have common goals. I hope that in the end I was smart, I worked hard, that I was a good person, and that I was an example to other Latinas who want to do what I do or anything like that. Or do what you do.Marina Ramos:	Yes. You activated at the college and you helped to make change in the college and then now you're a trustee of the college, Middlebury College.Caroline Ramos:	That's right.Marina Ramos:	That's a long way to go from being a student activist.Caroline Ramos:	Being a rabble-rouser.Marina Ramos:	Right. Calling me in the morning saying, ""We may be going to jail because we're sitting in on the Dean's room"", or whatever to where you are today.Caroline Ramos:	But you know what? I was totally terrified of making that phone call. But you were incredibly supportive and it was a whole lot different than getting busted for open container and going to jail. I'm glad that I had your support. You were like, ""Well, we'll figure it out. If that happens, just be careful. We'll figure it out."" I can't tell you how relieved I was because when I made that phone call, I thought she's going to pull me out of school. She'll get me out of here, and tell me to go school somewhere else. I don't know why, you never really gave me any reason to think that. I was just terrified that if I said I was going to get arrested, you are going to freak out and you didn't. You were very supportive. So I kept on rabble-rousing, and I never got arrested.Marina Ramos:	Good for you.Lily:	Can I ask a quick question?Caroline Ramos:	Sure.Lily:	So Sylvia, you talked about I think your career path, and from a young age, it's been really focused and controlled in knowing what you were going to do. It sounds like motherhood really was one of the main things that wasn't planned, unlike part of the plan. What do you think that gave-- You also said it's one the highest callings. What do you think that brought to your life?Marina Ramos:	Motherhood?Lily:	Or being Caroline's mother.Marina Ramos:	Yes.Caroline Ramos:	Which is totally different.Lily:	Well, in particular Caroline (inaudible)Marina Ramos:	Yes.Caroline Ramos:	I meant that sincerely. It's totally different.Marina Ramos:	Actually, it changed my mind about the raising of children and how what an active role a parent has in the raising of a child. Also what [00:40:00] interacting with a child gives to one is you learn how to be patient, how to look at things from at least three different perspectives, how to moderate yourself, obviously, you can't go overboard every time a child does something wrong, how to come back to the middle, how to think of the future in terms of what we're doing to a child today. It deepened my sense of myself as a person in the universe and what my role should be. I think that is what it did to me.Lily:	Caroline, if you could, if Santiago were one day to be listening to this, what would you want him to know about your mother?Caroline Ramos:	Well, he knows it himself and that is that my mother is an extraordinarily intense individual from so many different angles. I mean that in the best sense of the word, that she is extremely thoughtful and sometimes I criticize her for that and I say, ""You over-analyze things,"" but she always thinks of us. That she always thought about him and what was best for him and what would make him happy, and what would make him safe, and what would make him smarter or happier or safer or braver or, I mean, my mother always thinks of those kinds of things with respect to to Santiago and so he should know that she thought of him and thinks of him all the time.Marina Ramos:	Well, I thought this was going to be longer, but here we are at the end. I am so glad that you agreed to come with me. Because I have wanted to do this for a long time. I think, hopefully for you, as for me, there are some things that I can see and understand a little better. From having sat here and answered your questions mostly, but also hearing what you had to say. Thank you.Caroline Ramos:	Thank you, mom. I love you very much.Marina Ramos:	I love you too.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
MBY006648,"Trisha Gallegos:	[00:00:00] Hello. My name is Trisha Gallegos, I'm 39. Today's date is June 19th, 2010. Location is Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm here with my grandparents, Eloisa and Zack Montoya.Eloisa Montoya:	My name is Eloisa Montoya, and my age is 95. Today is June the 19th in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am here with my granddaughter, Trisha.Zack Montoya:	I am Zack Montoya from Wagon Mound, New Mexico. I am 97 years old, and I am with our granddaughter Trisha Gallegos, who treats me like a baby, and I'm enjoying her care very much.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, can you tell me where were you born?Zack Montoya:	I was born in Mora County, New Mexico. To be more exact in the little town where I live today, Wagon Mound.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, where were you born?Eloisa Montoya:	I was born in Sweetwater, New Mexico, about 11 miles from Springer, New Mexico, in the ranch.Trisha Gallegos:	Did you grow up there?Eloisa Montoya:	I grew up there, lived there until I got married.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, did you grow up in Wagon Mound?Zack Montoya:	Mostly East of Wagon Mound towards the Canadian River. My dad homesteaded a 160 acre there. In those days, when New Mexico was about to become a state, they were granting free land to married couples, and they had to live there. So my dad went there, and that's where I was raised.Trisha Gallegos:	Is that area still populated?Zack Montoya:	There are very few people left, and they're very much scattered. People have left the area because what used to be their livelihood, business ended because of the depression in those days, dry years, crops wouldn't grow, the domestic animals were very hard to maintain. So we moved into town, Wagon Mound.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, how would you describe your childhood?Eloisa Montoya:	I had a very, very happy livelihood, because my parents were very caring and very loving and nothing was too good for the family. They were precious.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, how would you describe your childhood?Zack Montoya:	They were very, very conscientious of making sure that we had a comfortable livelihood. My dad was very strict in that we attend school because he never had any schooling and he missed it a lot. He could read and write and he learned it all on his own plus he herded sheep in the Mora County area.Trisha Gallegos:	Can you tell me, grandma, where is your mom's family from?Eloisa Montoya:	I really don't know, because I lost my mother when I was three years old. So I really don't know much about my mom. I don't remember her at all.Trisha Gallegos:	Your dad, grandpa [inaudible 00:04:53] was  married later after?Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. When my mom died, he [00:05:00] took care of us for four years before he married another lady, which was our mother. Our stepmother was very, very good to us. She took hold of the family right away.Trisha Gallegos:	So that must have been like 19, you were born in 1915, so that was about 1919, 1920.Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. I was seven years old when she came. Yes. Because when my mom died, I was three years old. So all those four years there.Trisha Gallegos:	What about you dad? Where was your dad from?Eloisa Montoya:	Where was what?Trisha Gallegos:	Your dad from, your father?Eloisa Montoya:	My dad? He worked in Cimarron, but when I was born, he had a ranch in Sweetwater.Trisha Gallegos:	Do you know where he was from?Eloisa Montoya:	Well, really, that was another thing. He was kidnapped by the Indians, and the Indians had him until he was about 15 years old. His Indian mother told him one day, ""I have a horse for you, you go back home.""Trisha Gallegos:	So where did he go?Eloisa Montoya:	He came to Cimarron.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, do you know where your mom's family is from?Zack Montoya:	They were originally from the Watrous-Tiptonville area in Mora County. They lived there till she married my dad and they went on to Wagon Mound, where they lived the rest of the time.Trisha Gallegos:	Was your dad from that area also?Zack Montoya:	My dad was from, what they call today, Rainsville area in Mora County. That's where he was born and lived there till he went to the Wagon Mound area when he was in teenagers, somewhere along there.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, can you tell me what the happiest moment of your life was?Eloisa Montoya:	I think the happiest moment of my life was when I married my high school sweetheart.Trisha Gallegos:	That was a good moment. How about you, grandpa, what was your happiest moment?Zack Montoya:	I think when I got my master's degree at the University of Highlands because I was always dreaming of getting a degree and that materialized and I still have a good feeling about those moments.Trisha Gallegos:	What was the school called then when you went to school? It wasn't called New Mexico Highlands at that time. What was it called?Zack Montoya:	When I went there first it was known as New Mexico Normal University.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, can you tell me what is your earliest memory?Zack Montoya:	I'm sorry?Trisha Gallegos:	Your earliest memory in your life, can you remember?Zack Montoya:	Maybe it was just growing up at the ranch. Probably the first time I went to school, I was very scared and that memory has stayed with me.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, how was your relationship with your parents?Eloisa Montoya:	We were a very, very happy family, we had a lot of fun talking to each other, and my dad and mom were very loving and very caring.Trisha Gallegos:	How about you grandpa, how was your relationship with your parents?Zack Montoya:	They were very much caring for all the family. I was raised in a family that, we were eight, four boys and four girls. My dad worked long hours to keep us alive and healthy. He took good care of us and I have very good memories of my parents as I was growing up.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, when in life have you felt [00:10:00] most alone?Eloisa Montoya:	I guess, I could say that when my husband went into the military and I was left alone with a two and a three-year-old children, and there for a while, I didn't know what I was going to do.Trisha Gallegos:	That was World War II? How did the war change you, grandpa? Did the war change you?Zack Montoya:	I think in a way that I became more caring and realized more how important my family was because I had never left them alone like I did when I had to go in the military, and realize then how important it was because we were always very close to each other. We're one close family.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, who has been the biggest influence in your life?Zack Montoya:	I've met several people. I would say that my sixth grade teacher was the first man teacher I had, and he was very caring and very strict. At that time, I didn't like him because of that, but later realized that he did more for my life to teach me the right way as compared with the wrong way to live with people and with myself.Trisha Gallegos:	He was a teacher in Wagon Mound, not in the place you grew up?Zack Montoya:	It was in Wagon Mound.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, who was your biggest influence in your life?Eloisa Montoya:	I think my parents. They always made us do our chores, they were very, you know, we had work to do and we did it, and I think that they are the ones that influenced my life so much, and they always wanted us to do the best that we could do in school.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, how important is Spanish to you?Eloisa Montoya:	Spanish is very important to me because that's my culture, and Spanish is such a beautiful language. We don't want to lose it.Trisha Gallegos:	Yes. Grandpa -- Or, grandma, can you tell me what your parents or grandparents said about going to school?Eloisa Montoya:	For us to go to school was a high priority. That was a must. The only time we missed school is when we got sick, and that was not very often, because we were a healthy family.Trisha Gallegos:	Did you enjoy school?Eloisa Montoya:	I enjoyed it to the fullest.Trisha Gallegos:	How about you, grandpa, did you enjoy school?Zack Montoya:	Very much. I got to know other people, other friends who were rare back in the ranch when we come to school, know how other boys like me acted and lived their lives, and it was very wholesome.Trisha Gallegos:	What kind of student were you?Zack Montoya:	I was considered above average in my classes every time.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, what kind of student were you?Eloisa Montoya:	I wasn't considered the hardest [laughter], because I wanted to have fun.Trisha Gallegos:	What did you do?Eloisa Montoya:	I got into trouble a lot of times, but school, to me, was the best.Trisha Gallegos:	What did you do for fun?Eloisa Montoya:	At home, we used to get out and play baseball. That's only for three or four of my brothers and me, I was the only girl there.Trisha Gallegos:	Was there a teacher, grandpa mentioned his teacher as his biggest influence, did you have a teacher that was influential to you?Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. There was one particular teacher, and her name [00:15:00] was Viola Gibson. She was very loving with me, she talked to me. But maybe she was that way because she knew that I had lost my mother.Trisha Gallegos:	She was a good woman to you. Grandpa, in school, were you allowed to speak Spanish?Zack Montoya:	As I was growing up, in the grade school, speaking Spanish was punishable, because the emphasis on learning English was very strong. We were mum because I didn't know English, and I was not allowed to speak Spanish. I spend a lot of quiet moments, but eventually listening to the teacher and to other students that knew English, I gradually grabbed it almost by necessity. I tried real hard to learn English till I could get by pretty well.Trisha Gallegos:	Tell me, grandpa, what kind of work your parents or grandparents did.Zack Montoya:	My parents and grandparents did farming and grazing animals. We seldom went to town because we had the meat, and corn, beans, all the food grown right at home. The only thing we had to get from the store sometime would be syrup, sugar, stuff that we couldn't raise and that happened only every couple of months that we went to town in those days, and it was only like 20 miles, but by horse and wagon and poor roads, it was a matter of a whole day and I have to go to town and bring groceries.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, what kind of work did your parents and grandparents do?Eloisa Montoya:	What kind of?Trisha Gallegos:	Work did your parents and grandparents do?Eloisa Montoya:	My dad take care of his animals. We had cows, we had horses, and sheep. My mom would take care of the house.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, can you finish this sentence and tell me about it? ""I was the first person in my family who.""Zack Montoya:	Whoever finished my higher education, all my brothers and sisters dropped out some first or second year of secondary, but I went on to complete my master's degree and enjoyed my educational retirement after that.Trisha Gallegos:	Can you tell me, grandpa, how you met grandma?Zack Montoya:	She lived out in the country, out of Wagon Mound. They closed the grade school where she use to go in Nolan. They were trucking them, there were no school buses then, the big truck they brought them to all the kids around the area to Wagon Mound. First time I saw her I kept looking at her and she wouldn't look at me for awhile, but I bothered until she did.Trisha Gallegos:	How did you know that she was the one?Zack Montoya:	I wasn't sure because I didn't know what her answer would be.Trisha Gallegos:	How did you propose?Zack Montoya:	By the twinkle of an eye.Trisha Gallegos:	Do you remember, grandma, how he proposed?Eloisa Montoya:	I don't know. I think we went together for many years, and we just thought, ""We've got to be together."" [00:20:00] Yes. I knew that I wouldn't marry anybody else, but him.Trisha Gallegos:	Was there any kind of formal proposal with the families or did you have to ask permission for her hand?Zack Montoya:	Yes. More of a formality, my parents went to her ranch and we all met in their front room at the ranch, and they all stood up and my dad spoke up, told him what it was all about. ""I would like to have the hand of your daughter in marriage for my son."" I asked my dad, ""Will you ask for the hand of my daughter."" He was a silly guy like me and he said, ""Why do you want the hand alone? Get the whole girl.""Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, have you ever thought about getting a divorce?Zack Montoya:	Never.Trisha Gallegos:	No?Zack Montoya:	Never.Eloisa Montoya:	He has thought of murder, though.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, what advice would you give? Let's see, now you've been married 71 years?Eloisa Montoya:	Uh-huh.Trisha Gallegos:	Seventy one almost seventy two years. What advice do you have for young couples, grandpa?Zack Montoya:	I think that the biggest is to make sure that their love is sincere and not just a passing fancy, make sure that the love is real, not make believe. I was so troubled many times today just infatuated, and go to a wedding and it dissolve because they didn't really have that love that is needed for a lasting marriage. I think we had it because of this 70 some years have been most joyous.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, would you have any advice for young couples?Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. I think that the most important thing that they have open communication with each other. Don't keep anything to yourself. Let your partner know what's in your thoughts, and communication is very important.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandma, have you ever experienced any miracles?Eloisa Montoya:	Have you what?Trisha Gallegos:	Experienced any miracles?Eloisa Montoya:	Not really miracles, but I know that during our life we have been blessed with so many things, so many things that we don't think of and it comes to us. I think that that has come because we both are very prayerful, we like to pray and ask the Lord to lead us, guide us in the right path.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, have you experienced any miracles?Zack Montoya:	I think that -- In my youth I happened to get very sick, you notice, in grammar school and I heard the medic, a doctor in those days, there were no automobiles, he came in a horse and buggy, raced to our ranch, and I heard him when he told my folks that he'd be lucky if I was alive next morning, that I have a heavy case or pneumonia. Some miracle must have happened that I thank the Lord for the life I had received up to then, and like a miracle, I changed overnight and I felt so much better the next day and improved to very good health in the next few weeks. So, I look back as a miracle that I was almost dead. I felt it.Trisha Gallegos:	Can you tell me how you felt when you had your first child?Eloisa Montoya:	[00:25:00] I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to take care of the baby, but with my husband's help, it was just a blessing to hold the child. That's a miracle.Trisha Gallegos:	When you had your first child, were you living in the house that you live in now?Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. Yes, Clara was born in Wagon Mound, yes.Trisha Gallegos:	And who else lived near -- Did either one of your parents live near you or with you when you had your children?Eloisa Montoya:	I had his mom. I depended more on his mom than my mom, because my step-mother didn't have any children. She knew more about taking care of a child.Trisha Gallegos:	Is that Grandma Carlota?Eloisa Montoya:	Yes. She was a good mother to him and to me too.Trisha Gallegos:	Grandpa, when you meet God, what would you like to say to Him?Zack Montoya:	The only outstandingly I would thank the Lord for the good life He has given me and these many years alive. Not too many people over 96 nowadays get around and go around as fluently as I go around, yes, I've been very blessed in that way. I thank my good Lord for giving me that strength.Trisha Gallegos:	How about you, grandma, is there anything you'd like -- What would you say?Eloisa Montoya:	To tell the Lord?Trisha Gallegos:	Yes.Eloisa Montoya:	I would thank Him for all the blessings that He has bestowed on us and tell Him how much I love Him.Trisha Gallegos:	Thank you. I really, really was excited to do this interview with you guys, and I thank you very much.Zack Montoya:	I think it's been an honor to have done this, and I would thank the place here.  Eloisa Montoya:	You are one of our blessings that the Lord has given us.Trisha Gallegos:	Thank you, grandma.Zack Montoya:	Thank the place here for this wonderful facility that made it so easy for us to do this. Thank you so much.Trisha Gallegos:	I love you guys very much.Eloisa Montoya:	I love you too, mijita.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
MBY006659,"Victor Romero:	[00:00:00] Well, greetings. Saludos.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	I'm Victor Romero. I'm a month shy of being 55 years old. Today's June 21st, 2010, we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, right outside the Hispanic Cultural Center. I'm here to conduct an interview with my dear old dad, Ross Romero, who will now introduce himself.Rosendo Romero:	My name is Rosendo Romero. I was born in February the 12th, 1928. That makes me 62 years plus. I'm very glad to be here. I'm very glad to be across my son Victor, here, whom I love very much.Victor Romero:	Well, I'm glad if I could make it here from Washington DC to join you for Father's Day. We've had a lot of time together the last couple of days and had a chance to compare notes about what we want to go into the history books over here. You've always been a lover of history in the record. What do you think about being recorded for the Library of Congress?Rosendo Romero:	I think it's a wonderful thing, I love it, every bit of it.Victor Romero:	Well, I hope I can get you to Washington, we can hear a whole bunch of these things, top to bottom. Hey, in the spirit of what this particular initiative is about, the Historias project, I thought would be helpful for our listeners, our friends, families, and folks who will study this in the future, to get some, what I'm calling boilerplate historia stuff under our belts. In particular, I'd like to hear you talk a little bit about how you self-identify. I mean, I come from a generation where it's okay to be called Chicano. Is that what you are, dad?Rosendo Romero:	No. Actually, our generation never did like the name Chicano, because it came from the Pachucos. Are you familiar with Pachucos?Speaker_3:	Mm hmm.Rosendo Romero:	Yes. But we have come to accept it.Victor Romero:	What do you call yourself today, dad?Rosendo Romero:	I like to call myself a Southwest Hispanic, as opposed to a Miami Hispanic.Victor Romero:	Oh, I see. There's a whole range of them out there.Rosendo Romero:	I didn't invent it, but I'll tell you the story if you want to hear about it, I coined that term. But later on, I heard a commentator use it, in one of the Hispanic columnist that write through the papers. There's a big difference between Southwest Hispanics and Southeast Hispanics or Northeast Hispanics.Victor Romero:	Well, this gets us to one of our favorite topics over here. In New Mexico, you long taught me and I firmly believe has been a long isolated place. We had Spanish New Mexicans here, and of course, with Mexicans trickling in here and now we have a lot more Mexican Americans or New Mexicans coming here. Talk a little bit about how Albuquerque in particular has changed.Rosendo Romero:	We had very little communication with Mexico after New Mexico became a part of the country, the Union. It wasn't until maybe the last half of my generation that we had to do with them they were always strange, they spoke different, they ate different things, and so forth. But we had no problem with them, because they were a very small part of the population. But we always took pains to identify ourselves as Raza. I used to wonder about that. I used to wonder about just what  does it mean. But it's not uncommon for people to take a name to identify themselves as such. I understand in Texas, they referred to the Mexicans as Nationals. I don't know if you were aware of that one. I have nothing against Mexicans. Really, I'd love to speak Spanish and why not? Spanish was my first language. I spoke it to my mother. It would be unthinkable for me to speak English to my mother. It would be unthinkable for me to speak English to my father or the older people, the uncles, the aunts, and everybody in the neighborhood. I grew up very comfortable, I went to school, I learned English. I'm very comfortable in English. I read a hell of a lot and I read mostly in English, because you can't get that much Spanish out here to read. But I pick up and read as much as I can. If for no other reason to keep in practice, I already own the Spanish language, I may as well keep at it.Victor Romero:	I hope you're not disappointed that I'm not perfectly bilingual. I think you brought us up to appreciate and love Spanish. We have just enough to get by, it appears to me.Rosendo Romero:	I understand completely, and I also know that English is a very dynamic, important language. The reason that we kept at it, because I learned it first, but it's no big deal. I'm very proficient in English. To tell you the truth, I'm such a reader that I'd like to read English. I like to read the classics, but I also like to read, again, it's not that much available. Do you remember the comic books I used to bring home?Victor Romero:	Oh, yeah.Rosendo Romero:	We can't get a hold of them anymore. I used to bring Spanish language comic books, Donald Duck and so forth and they were great. A number of years ago, you asked me to pick you up a copy, but I haven't been able to find them.Victor Romero:	We'll keep our eyes and ears open. But [00:05:00] you're inching into our favorite topic here, and you've already started doing it. We're all about cuentos, you and me, right?Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	Could you tell me a story about your real early years here in Albuquerque? You said that you were born in Madrid, New Mexico. How old were you when the family came here, and is not true that from where we're sitting, you initially lived here just a few blocks away?Rosendo Romero:	Yes. We left Madrid, New Mexico, that was a coal mining town, at the beginning of the depression, because of lack of work. We ended up in Albuquerque, my mother and my father, we settled there. We lived at a half a dozen different places, always looking for a little cheaper rent. We finally settled in living on Santa Fe Avenue, close to the Zoo, which was a great class. I went to school. My first year of school was a Catholic school, which was pretty normal. There was called a kindergarten, and we had a Spanish language nun, which was very good because my words -- I never knew that much English when I went to school. But you learn. You learn fast. After my first year of being in the Catholic school, we went over to public school and that's where I finished up.Anna:	What are your early memories of those school days?Rosendo Romero:	Well, I come from a big family, older brothers and sister, younger brothers and sisters. It was a completely Hispanic family and everything was family for us and my mother and my father had nephews and nieces that lived away from here. But because our family was one of the first to come to Albuquerque, they used to drop in every week or every other week whenever they had a chance. I have very, very good memories of them coming in at three o'clock in the morning and my mother being so happy to see Ambrosio or Reyes and so forth. I had a particularly good cousin, that was a nephew of my father, that loved to sing and I still remember him singing and I still remember the songs.Victor Romero:	What were the songs?Rosendo Romero:	La Pajarera.Victor Romero:	How did it go?Rosendo Romero:	[singing] La la la la la, la la la. I know the tune. [singing] Yo soy la pajarera... And so forth. But the other tunes I know real good because the other nephews, my mother's nephews were teaching me how to sing. [singing] Esta noche por la luna [inaudible 00:07:27] llevar y el que no me tengo miedo que me la venga quitar. I learned that. I used to learn the other ones. I've got a dozen of them.Victor Romero:	Well, earlier you were telling me about making it down to San Pedro and San Antonio. Before we go any further, the neighborhood you grew up in Albuquerque was called?Rosendo Romero:	Tortilla Flats.Victor Romero:	Oh, no. Actually, you grew up in Barelas, we're in Tortilla Flats now, right?Rosendo Romero:	No. This became a poor addition to Barelas. The people that were a little more well-off settled over there and then this one settled up and this is where the poorer people set up. People that I knew from here used to refer themselves, ""I come from Flats."" That's when they spoke English.Anna:	Do you know what was the origin of the name Tortilla Flats. Do you know why it was called Tortilla Flats?Rosendo Romero:	Yes. That's because of the movie. The genre, the book that John Steinbeck wrote, and the movie that Spencer Tracy did. Have you ever seen the movie?Anna:	No, I'm not familiar with it.Rosendo Romero:	It should be required.Victor Romero:	Hey, talk a little bit, please, about San Pedro and San Antonio. I think it's important to explain that's where grandma and grandpa came from.Rosendo Romero:	My father and my mother were both born and reared in San Pedro, which is about 90 miles south of here, on the east side of the river across from San Antonio. San Antonio's claim to fame was, well, that's where Conrad Hilton, the extraordinary hotel man, was born and raised in San Antonio. But my father, early in his age when he was about 10 or 12, took a job in the mines. There were two mines,  and [Toque 00:09:06] Carthage coal mining mines around the turn of the century. Him and his brothers, his uncles and everybody went to work there, and that's what they did until 1925. That mine gave out. That's when my mother and my father ended up in going to Madrid, New Mexico. That's where they worked for the next four years until that gave out. I was nine months old in my mother's arms when we came to Albuquerque.Victor Romero:	Then next thing --Rosendo Romero:	I have no memories of Madrid until after I grew up.Victor Romero:	The next thing you know, you're a Depression child.Rosendo Romero:	Oh, yeah. The beautiful Depression, did everything there. The first nickel I earned. Must have been 1933. The prohibition was still on and I was that generation that kept your eyes on the ground. I found an empty pint bottle, whiskey pint bottle. I don't know where in the hell we got the idea, but somebody said, ""There's a bootlegger down the street, he'll buy it from [00:10:00] you."" So took it over there, he gave me a nickel for it. I was real proud of that nickel, I took it to the local little store and I bought a stick of chewing gum, Wrigley chewing gum, for five cents.Victor Romero:	Hey, you also said that you were real early on in your money-making years, were in the newspaper business?Rosendo Romero:	Oh, yes. I think I was something. I found a way to go downtown and sell newspapers. It was easy for us growing up in the Santa Fe Avenue close to downtown, to go on at noon hour when we were released to lunch, that was the days before cafeterias there, by the way, so we sold news papers. The noon edition of the Albuquerque Tribune was a good seller, so we started to sell it and so forth. Of course, there was a big line of guys and you started at the rear. It was very orderly everybody had regulation. Well, anyway, I did that for about a year, and the reason I know the date because I used to read the newspaper avidly. The Civil War in Spain was still going on. So later on it clicked, okay. Well, here's the thing about it. Me and my cousin Rogelio were flipping pennies in a line, it was a good amusement. The guy that used to ride hard on us, we used to call him, ""The bossman"", came and saw us, and he gave me a two weeks suspension because I was dawdling on the job. That was pretty serious. I was devastated. But apparently my mother found a good excuse for me to go to San Pedro for two weeks. I had never been out of the city. My father never owned an automobile, so we never -- I never got to see Madrid until I was an older man.Victor Romero:	Did you spend these two weeks suspension in San Pedro?Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	What was it like? How did you get down there?Rosendo Romero:	Well, my cousin José used to drive a coal truck. There were still coal in  Toque here, for the public schools to burn; they used to burn coal then. From here back, he used to take a load of brick from the Kinney Brick Company to Socorro and so forth. So one afternoon my mother says, ""I got you some transportation to go Socorro."" I had never met some of these uncles of mine, and I had never been away from town. One of the memories I have that my mother gave me a sheaf of penny postcards for me to write her. So every day I would write her in Spanish, ""Estoy bien, no pierdas cuidado."" I like that, that's a good phrase. You don't have it in English, no pierdas cuidado. My younger brother Roberto told me that my mother used to send her all the way to  Arelas road, which is four blocks away where we had a marginal box, that's what they call the mail boxes away from the -- ""A veces me escribió mijito."" I loved that one.Victor Romero:	What was the experience in San Pedro like? Was it back in the 19th century as far as you're concerned?Rosendo Romero:	It was in the 19th century. We were pretty backward here, but there were [inaudible 00:12:53]. My Tio Juan that I stayed with had a radio that he used to charge with one of those wind driven generators.Victor Romero:	Yeah. What was the word you used in Spanish to describe it?Rosendo Romero:	Papalote, abanico.Victor Romero:	Meaning?Rosendo Romero:	Propeller? Windmill.Victor Romero:	Oh, yeah.Rosendo Romero:	Windmill. They had those around and I remember the vane, the weather vane on top of the propeller said aero on it. A-E-R-O. I've always been fascinated with the written word. I can't see anything without reading it. Anyway, he used to charge it into a car battery, and then take the car battery into the house and plug the radio in. At that time, KGTM radio in Albuquerque had a Spanish language hour from early in the morning, 6:30, 7:30. They tuned into that every day. In the meantime, I was very disappointed because I came from the big city and I used to follow Terry and the Pirates, and Jack Armstrong, The All-American boy in English. But that was not to be over there because my Tio Juan had it for one hour, the Spanish hour. He was the boss.Victor Romero:	Hey, listen. While you've taken me down to San Pedro, we'll get back to Albuquerque eventually. You also told me a really interesting story this week that I'd never heard. That was grandma's family, I guess, had encountered a wandering Mexican.Rosendo Romero:	My mother --Victor Romero:	I don't know how else to describe it.Rosendo Romero:	Yes. My mother told me that when she was a young girl, 10 or 12-years-old.Victor Romero:	She was born in what year?Rosendo Romero:	She was born in 1896.Victor Romero:	Okay. So we're talking very early 20th century, the familia's down in San Pedro. What happened?Rosendo Romero:	Of course, San Pedro is in the valley. They encountered this Mexican that was ill, and we later concluded that he had malaria. Anyway, my grandfather, my mother's father, and my mother took him in to take care of him until he got better, and he was having chills and so forth. My mother said he used to chill a lot and he use to talk, ""Manitos cabrones,"" and [00:15:00] so forth and so forth. The Mexicans used to refer to us as manitos, which means little brothers. Apparently, they knew the history of New Mexico, that New Mexico had become part of the United States nation. The Mexican kept saying, and he was shaking with a fever and so forth, ""Manitos cabrones vendidos,"" sell outs. In other words, he had it against the New Mexico people. My mother had never met a Mexican before. [laughter] My mother didn't know -- She had a vague idea, they were not very knowledgeable people, to speak nothing of it. I never did get across to my mother if she knew the history of it. But I know that I've met a lot of people my age that know very little about the history of that or anything.Victor Romero:	But you do carry another story around and I mean, I've heard it a time or two. Let's see if it's as exciting in a recording. The story about how your grandfather learned that he was now a US citizen. Please, tell us his name and what year we're talking about.Rosendo Romero:	We're talking about Reyes Montoya. That was my mother's father. So that makes him my grandfather. He was born in 1841. So when he was eight-years-old, and I've always imagined that it was part of a census. But anyway, at the little village of San Pedro, we used to call them pueblos, no? A sergeant, a three stripes, tres rayas, my Tio [Rogelio 00:16:25] told me this story 50, 60 years ago. Showed up in San Pedro with an Hispanic private, one raya, service interpreter. They called all the people there, and that wasn't a big settlement, but they called all the people; they called my father and my grandfather's name, Reyes, Reyes Montoya. Here comes a little boy of eight, nine-years-old, ""Que,"" what, ""Aqui estoy."" So the Sergeant read over here okay and he touched him. He was having fun; he touched my grandfather on the forehead, ""Reyes Montoya, ahora eres Americano.""Anna:	Which means?Rosendo Romero:	Now you're an American. And the older men over there started to laugh and he said, ""Que es eso?"" So this older man went over, ""Reyes, you are no longer a pinche Mexicano, now you are a pinche Americano.""Victor Romero:	Well, I think it's works a lot better if you tells what they said in Spanish this time.Rosendo Romero:	They told him Reyes, ""You're not a fucking Mexican anymore, now you're a fucking American"". [laughter]Victor Romero:	I still think it sounds better in Spanish Dad.Rosendo Romero:	I think so too. I love that word, pinche.Victor Romero:	[laughter] Well, you have taught us a lot of words along the way. You know, you also said that grandma and grandpa's people and the mines, also encountered the Welsh miners.Rosendo Romero:	Oh! That was a beautiful tale because at that time I was old enough to know about Wales, Welsh; they sing an awful lot. Were you aware of that?Anna:	That Wales sing?Rosendo Romero:	Wales, the Welsh people.Anna:	Oh Welsh, I'm sorry. Yes.Rosendo Romero:	Anyway, my father told me, that they call them [Slavos 00:17:59]. It came to me that they call them Slavos. But anyway, they came Toque to dig coal. And I don't know if you knew that, but the Welsh were displaced. To this day the Welsh do not consider themselves Englishmen. I don't know if you know that. And they ended up in the mining towns of the Southwest, particularly in the Carthage and Toque where my father -- Wonderful people and they also told me, they were always singing. That's stayed to me.Anna:	Can we go back to that story about Reyes Montoya for just a second, and he was your grandfather, did he ever talk about what that was like? What it felt like to have someone tell you suddenly you're a citizen of this different country, the border has moved?Rosendo Romero:	The way I understand it, people were very accepting of becoming part of the United States because they were so far from Mexico. People don't understand that, but the distances were great in those days. Okay.Victor Romero:	But dad, I think it's important for Anna to know that you ever meet your grandfather. Could you have talked with him about this?Rosendo Romero:	No. I never met him. He passed away about ten years before I was born. But I'll tell you one thing about my grandfather. In 1862, New Mexico was invaded by the Southerners. In this case being Texans. And they came into New Mexico part of the Civil War. And my grandfather enlisted in the Union Army. So he served for a couple of summers with the New Mexico Militia, with the Union Army uniform. He never forgot that. He used to say, ""Yo sirví al gobierno."" In Spanish it comes out, ""I served the government."" Ain't that great?Victor Romero:	How about we talk a little bit now about your own army experience? Would you like a drink?Rosendo Romero:	No, I'm fine.Victor Romero:	You went to being a Depression child and you were almost old enough to go to World War II, but as serving -- You went afterwards, of course, please talk about the years of the war and [00:20:00] how the family went off to California briefly.Rosendo Romero:	In 1942 everything changed. All of us suddenly had overnight jobs. Anyway, the government trained my older brother and my brother-in-law to be a machinist and a welder, and then they payed their way to go to Oakland to work at the shipyards. And we joined our brother, my mother and my three little brothers. I had three younger brothers and an older sister that was attending a university. And we went to California and immediately the day after we got there -- we went by train of course -- my father took me to the union hall to apply for a job and they asked me what I wanted to be and I said I didn't know. ""How about sheet metal helper? That sound good? I said, ""Okay fine."" I started to work the following day and I loved it. I loved getting a paycheck. I'd love working steady. I loved every bit about it.But in three months, my mother had to come back because my brothers had to go to school and I had to go to school. I was in that period between the ninth grade and tenth grade. So we came back and things continued. And I continued going to the tenth grade until I finally left. I wanted to earn money and I really didn't care about going back to school anyway because I was a lot smarter than guys were in school. Anyway, I stuck around until my birthday. In California at that time, you could work at shipyards if you were 16 years old. Incidentally, I had to lie that I was 16 years old a year before, but by that time I was bona fide, great, that I was 16 years old. So I took a job, and also in California my brothers, sisters everybody up there. My mother followed up with kids the following day and we stayed up for a couple of years. My little brothers went to school in California. They learned to be good English speakers.Anyway, I became a machinists apprentice and so forth. In the meantime, the war was winding down in 1945, and everybody knew that. And all the talk, the constant -- Everybody knew once the war is over, you're going to be flat out, no more jobs, no more war, no more Defense Department and so forth. So I had -- me and a young boy by the name of Lee, young Anglo American boy, decided to join the Merchant Marines, but that didn't come out too good because the Merchant Marine was only hiring older guys. In the meantime, the guys in the shipyard that were older that had been taking refuge, so to speak, in the shipyards, jumped into the Merchant Marine, but they wouldn't take me and Lee because we were only 16 years old.But he gave me a note. The guy gave me a note. ""You come from an inland state,"" he said. ""Yes, New Mexico."" ""Why don't you go back to New Mexico and try joining. The government has a program where they train young men like you that are 16 and they make midshipmen out of them and they put them on a merchant ship,"" and so forth and so forth.So that sounded good. So I came back to Albuquerque, signed up for it. They told me, ""I'll call you in another month, or so forth, in the meantime, get a birth certificate."" Let me remind you something. At that time in age, very few people had birth certificates. I was delivered by a midwife. So I had to do that. I had to apply for a birth certificate and then I will fly to go to Denver for a physical examination. In the meantime, I had taken another job, but that's another story. Okay. Anyway, I ended up going to Denver for an examination and it turned out, they asked you all kinds of questions. Is there insanity in the family, or heart attacks and so forth. So I went and blurbed out that I had a problem with my ear, and I always drained out; I would walk around with piece of cotton in there. So the doctor said, ""Hold on."" He dug in there and got a piece of wax and says, ""I can't take you. You're ineligible for what you're trying to do because you have a perforated eardrum, and very severe."".So I walked out of there with tears in my eyes back to Albuquerque, took another job and I strategized. I was already out of school. I was in Albuquerque, I was not in the shipyard. So I said, ""I'll wait until I'm 18,"" at that time I was 17, ""I'll wait till I'm 18 in 1946, and I'll wait for them to draft me."" I had made up my mind that if they draft you, they take people that are less healthy than the healthy ones. [laughter] That's a hell of a conclusion, isn't it? Well, anyway, I went to work for a plumber. I really loved that. Y'all have to remember, being a Depression baby, all I wanted was a trade and I happened to like plumbing. Okay. So when it came time for me to go to the army, they gave me a physical examination. In the meantime, there's a lot of guys around that had been over there. The thing to do is to go to Fort Bliss for the examination and they told me not to sweat it. The guy that checks ears at Fort Bliss is a neighborhood guy with a name Damian Sandoval. How do you like that one? They said, ""You can't miss him. You walk by there and he'll check your ear. You tell where you were."" As a matter of fact, I knew his brother real good. [00:25:00] Okay. So I told him, ""Damian, you know I live in the neighborhood. I think I have a little problem in my ear, but I don't think it's serious."" ""Oh, let me check it out."" He checked it out, ""You're all right,"" he said. Great, I passed. So came back to Albuquerque, they told us, ""You have 30 days to get your affairs in order."" This is already March, April 1946. So I got a letter --.Victor Romero:	1946.Rosendo Romero:	So I got a letter informing me and everybody else to line up in the alley behind the Court Cafe. The Court Cafe is just north of Forth Street. So we were there early in the morning, they called our names and they said, ""You can go home. The draft is over with. They are not drafting anybody. The war was over with, you can go home."" So me and three other friends of mine that were close neighbors decided well, let's enlist. We waited around 'til the recruiting station opened and they gave us another tester and they sent us home until 12 o'clock so they could pick us up again. In the meantime, I didn't tell my mother had enlisted because it's all right one thing for the government to get you, but another thing for you to volunteer for the government. Anyway, here we end up in Fort Bliss again thinking that -- Damian was still there, passed completely. I joined up in the army, ended up in Virginia, and I loved every bit of it. The army decided to make me a photographer. I spent 12 weeks going to school as a photo lithographer in Virginia and I loved every bit. The only thing I couldn't stand in Virginia, it took me several months to figure out, I couldn't see the horizon. I don't know if you went through that when you moved out there.Victor Romero:	When I moved there, I couldn't get over the trees. They seemed to be in the way of everything.Rosendo Romero:	[laughter] Anyway, I stayed in the army, ended up in Hawaii, which everybody thought it was great except me. The opportunity was there. Ended up in an a printing plant, printing topographic prints. Anyway, I found a way to get out of that. I enlisted. I asked for duty and another there were looking for volunteers. So I ended up as a surveyor in the South Pacific. Good thing about going to the South Pacific somehow or another, somebody discovered that I was pretty much on the ball. So when I got to the South Pacific, the island of Manus, Northeast of New Guinea, they called my name. They were in Australia there that managed the affairs for the island. They were Melanesian natives. He said, ""You made a pretty good grade over here and we're going to teach you Pidgin English."" I thought, ""What in the hell is that?"" But I found out Pidgin English consists of 29 words and anybody can learn them. Least of all me.Victor Romero:	Would you still know some of these words?Rosendo Romero:	I love those words. [speaking Pidgin English].Victor Romero:	What's that mean?Rosendo Romero:	What's your name? Then you'll answer like that. By, by my, my name long Victor. Their Rs are S and their S are Rs. So for per pound, they say found. For Rosendo, they used to say ""Losendo"" and so forth. The ones that were Christian had a little cross tattooed here. The ones that were Seventh Day Adventist didn't have a cross.Victor Romero:	They had a cross tattooed where, Dad?Rosendo Romero:	They tattooed.Victor Romero:	Where? On their chest?Rosendo Romero:	On their chest right here.Victor Romero:	Okay.Rosendo Romero:	Their names. Well, it turned out I kept records of them because we used to hire them to carry things for us to knock down trees and so forth. I had a great time.Victor Romero:	So how long were you on the island there?Rosendo Romero:	I was in that island one whole year.Victor Romero:	Yeah?Rosendo Romero:	My time was up, I came back with intentions of staying in the army. But this happened or that happened. By that time, I found a good job. I went to work with -- Oh, I went to work at the post office, which is a family job. My father was proud of me and my mother was proud of me. I always want to have a son who worked with the government. The government my dad said is sure work. You'll get to be 80 years old before they lay you off. [laughter]Victor Romero:	Well this turned into a timeline discussion dad, what year is it by this point?Rosendo Romero:	1948.Victor Romero:	Yeah. So you're working for the post office and do you think -- Rosendo Romero:	In the meantime, I had taken a civil service test as a photographer because I was a photographer and I passed the test. I waited for two whole years after I went to work in the post office, they sent me a notice that I had three days to answer this summons. I either wanted the job or not. They had a job for me as a photographer. The older guys in a post office told me, ""Quit now. You're young now, but the post office gets old. Very physical."" So I took. I ended up working for the Corps of Engineers for the next 37 years.Victor Romero:	Yeah. You really enjoyed this Corps of Engineers it sounds to me.Rosendo Romero:	I really enjoyed it because I got to see a lot of the state. I loved taking pictures. I loved the printing part of it. I really loved it.Victor Romero:	But I remember too that you made an effort to moonlight, as you called it. In my year we call freelancing. But I know in the South Valley where we grew up, I was always known as the photographer's son because of the pictures you took. Why don't you tell the listeners about being the poor man photographer in the South Valley.Rosendo Romero:	So many people asking me to make copies of their pictures because we had the equipment. I had the equipment and they didn't have to purchase other pictures. [00:30:00] So I started to make money. At that time the fad came from California, wedding albums. Before that, there were studio shots. So I started wedding photography. I made a darkroom in the backyard. I loved that dark room. Especially on a cold, winter day. You used to do your studies in the freezer. You used to ask me what's this Spanish word for work? You used to do your Spanish lessons over there. But I became a wedding photographer and I enjoyed every bit of it.Victor Romero:	Well how about some anecdotes for those days? I remember Gustavo and I and David, I think a bit, we all got to tag along with you as the photographer's assistant. Could you talk about the equipment you used and why you needed a young helper?Rosendo Romero:	I would run if soil. I was a photographer that used flash bulbs. That I was always running short of flash bulbs. So I used to have to park the car away from town, go to the drugstore and buy flash bulbs. They wouldn't stay in the car. They wanted to go with me into the drug store. They had the [inaudible 00:31:02] ""Stay here so you can take care of the camera. Gus, stay here."" But anyway, we all got used to that. We all got used to the wedding ceremonies. What you use to say when I used to click a picture, ""At it boy dad. You been another $3. Gus, when do we eat?""Victor Romero:	What I do remember about those weddings is how well they treated us because we were behind the scenes now.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	We always ate well.Rosendo Romero:	Oh, you always ate. You were the first ones to eat because the commodities were there, the compadre. A lot of the weddings were part of the family. [In Spanish] sit over here and you and David and Gus would be eating. We'd come home you'd brag to your mother, ""We had a great meal. A lot of mashed potatoes."".Victor Romero:	Mashed potatoes and red chilly, that was one of my favorite I think so.Rosendo Romero:	Red chilly and mashed potatoes was, I don't know who ordained it, but it was part of the wedding feast.Victor Romero:	Okay. You know before we took out a ten-minute signal because this is very rapidly cover some other important aspects of the, [inaudible 00:32:00] you're are telling us, we've only had a barely a passing mention of mom. Tell me where you met mom, when you were married.Rosendo Romero:	In 1948 working for the post office. 1949. It was a windy day and Good Friday, that means April, March. The Church of San Jose that South of us and the other street that way. They were mailing out the envelopes, the contribution information. I had taken that route because the regular man for that route happened to be Mr. Jones and he had a contract car there and I drove it, it was a Model A, but the addresses were all messed up, the people didn't have mailboxes, the wind was terrible and so forth. I got to the street on Lily Avenue where your grandmother used to live and your mother used to live, and they had marginal boxes. In those days, you lived away from the main street, you put up a box at the main street and you'd walk a block or two and pick up your mail; and I'll be down there with this pretty nice, pretty, pretty, very pretty girl over there, she was about 17, I said, ""Wow, I'd like to meet her. I wonder how I could meet her?"" And I said when I get the route again, as it would happen, I never got that stupid route again. The other guys got it but I never did, I used to take the route on the other guy's day off. Okay, fair, but as luck would have it, when I got older, I got to meet her and I told her, ""You must be that the young girl that I saw here three or four years ago?"" ""Well yes,"" she said, ""Do you remember me?"" ""Oh yes, you were that older fella who delivered the mail.""Victor Romero:	You all were married what year?Rosendo Romero:	We were married in 1954.Victor Romero:	How many years does that make? Let's do some math.Rosendo Romero:	Figure it out.Victor Romero:	Well, I'm 55.Rosendo Romero:	Yeah.Victor Romero:	You're getting ready to celebrate your sixty?Rosendo Romero:	Fifty six. Fifty six, fifty seven, fifty eight.Victor Romero:	Yes and had lived the whole time here in Albuquerque?Rosendo Romero:	All the time, yes.Victor Romero:	I'm so glad you brought us up in the South Valley. I really enjoyed growing up there, dad.Rosendo Romero:	Oh, I love the South Valley. I love it.Victor Romero:	The South Valley, why do you love it?Rosendo Romero:	It's different. I have Anglo American friends that live in the South Valley and they wouldn't live any place else. Remember Mr. Glass, your history teacher?Victor Romero:	Oh, sure. Barry Glass.Rosendo Romero:	I got to see him alive in the last few years, he just passed away, I don't know if I told you.Victor Romero:	Yes. I was aware.Rosendo Romero:	We were talking about it, remember he was real quiet?Victor Romero:	Mm-hmm.Rosendo Romero:	He said, ""I wouldn't live any place else."".Victor Romero:	Right.Rosendo Romero:	Yes. It's a Utopia but it's a state of mind too but don't tell anybody this, unless you tell this young lady over here but I didn't want my boys growing up with the goddamn Gringos.Victor Romero:	Well, you know as it turned out, we've been around long enough to have a lot of experiences, and I'm going to tell you the Gringos didn't turn out to be too bad.Rosendo Romero:	No.Victor Romero:	Don't forget, I'm married to a Gringa myself and we just had our 21st anniversary. Christine has always said, this is one of the best parts of her life, has being accepted by our family.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	You know and one of [00:35:00] the things I've always liked about the South Valley and how familia like we are, as you tell me years later, folks I went to high school with, people I went to college with still come knock on the door to say hello.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	So I want to thank you very much for being so hospitable to all the stray cats in our family.Rosendo Romero:	We made some very good friends and then look forward to Christmas because with Christmas, it's a tradition at our house, is everybody is welcome to come and eat. We get lines of people to come and eat.Victor Romero:	Well, I'm sorry that we weren't able to get mom in here for an interview, I think we'll have to do one of the informal story core efforts, which means that Anna and her helpers won't be able to be in the same room but I fully intend to get one of those kits I read about and see if we can make a contribution to the cause. We're down to just a very few minutes.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	This is your last crack at the Library of Congress archives dad, is there anything you're just dying to say?Rosendo Romero:	I remember this fellow, I remember the 4th of July, it's 1938, 1930. I'd like to tell about it, we used to buy firecrackers, we didn't mess around with sparklers. They had speeches at the park and I remember this fellow, his name was Pargas and he used to speak in Spanish and he used to say, [In Spanish] ""God bless us for being Americans."" I never forgot that. Here's a guy, served in the First World War, so forth. Coincidentally my mother had one cousin and one brother that served in the First World War and they never forgot that. Put the flag up and so forth and so forth. They were good people to look up to. Incidentally, before I forget, I think I made account and my memory may be a little faulty, but we counted the nephews and nieces that my mother and father had in the Second World War, and I think they came up to 31. My older brother never made it because he was sickly.Victor Romero:	Okay. There we go. Okay, so I think we're going to wind down here real soon. Absolute last chance to tell me if you want to say anything else for the record.Rosendo Romero:	Thank you for asking.Victor Romero:	Did you enjoy this?Rosendo Romero:	I enjoyed it very much.Victor Romero:	What I'm thinking we're going to do next is see if I can fix you up to get some oral history soon with the mother's, what do you think of that?Rosendo Romero:	I think I would love that, if you can put up with my voice. I am 82 years old and I noticed that my voice is not as strong as yours.Victor Romero:	Yeah, I noticed it. I don't know how to push the mike back a little bit after we did our test.Rosendo Romero:	I wish I could remember some of those songs.Victor Romero:	Oh, dad, I wish we could do nothing but 40 minutes of your wonderful singing.Rosendo Romero:	[In Spanish] I have your picture in front of me. He hasn't seen his girlfriend and he's away but he has this picture of his girlfriend near and he entertains himself by looking at it all night. What do you think of that?Victor Romero:	What do you think of the [Spanish]Rosendo Romero:	Oh, that's a beautiful one. I have always loved it. [Singing in Spanish] I love that.Victor Romero:	Well I can't think of a better way to end on that romantic note.Rosendo Romero:	Remember that fellow, Ray Cooper, was that his name?Victor Romero:	Yes, Ry Cooder.Rosendo Romero:	He did it. Cooder?Victor Romero:	Cooder, yes.Rosendo Romero:	He did the song.Victor Romero:	Yes. So did Los Lobos and a lot of other people and I think we'll listen to it on your CD when we get back in the car in a few minutes.Rosendo Romero:	Yes.Victor Romero:	Dad thank you very, very much for taking the time today.Rosendo Romero:	My pleasure.Anna:	We have just a few minutes and I just wanted to throw this in, if you wanted to answer. Rosendo, if you have, just words that you would like directly for your children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to hear, as if they were here, to listen to them?Rosendo Romero:	Well it's unfortunate, we never had grandchildren and I'm going to tell you the reason why, you want to know the reason why? My mother said I scared the hell out of you. I don't go for any foolishness, I told them as they were growing up. You get a girl pregnant, you're going to have to support her. None of that. None of this. None of that. So I think I scared the heck out of them.Anna:	What about for just future generations? I mean a legacy that you would want to share?Victor Romero:	Or what's your final words of wisdom for today's interview? Words of wisdom?Rosendo Romero:	Enjoy yourselves. Really, enjoy yourselves. Take time out. Smell the roses. Go see a good movie. Make sure it's a good movie. I hate movies, anymore. Let's see what else. Be good to people. I was just telling you an hour ago, I remember every slight I've ever done to anybody in my life. It's incredible. I slighted somebody, I haven't treated somebody and I always remember it. Can't be that many.Victor Romero:	Well, I just hope you find ways to make it up. I do know you passed [00:40:00] that along to me. I carry a lot of thoughts and memories about things I might have done different to individuals, but I try and make it up. But I believe strongly in karma before it was cool.Rosendo Romero:	Remember the philosopher said, ""If you're going to do some good, do it once."" By the way because you only come this way once but I remember that. I'll tell you one of the slights were out there.Victor Romero:	Okay.Rosendo Romero:	It stays with me.Victor Romero:	Thank you for bringing me this far, okay daddio?Rosendo Romero:	You're welcome. Thank the young lady there.Victor Romero:	Thank you Anna.Anna:	Thank you.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
MBY006671,"Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	[00:00:00] My name is Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela. I'm 31 years old. Today's June 25th, 2010, and we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I'm interviewing my father.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	My name is Lorenzo Zuniga Jr., I'm 63 years of age. Today is June 25th, 2010 and we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. I'm Sabina's father.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	One of the things I really wanted to find out about and be able to know and hold onto is stories and facts about your side of the family, particularly. So I was wondering how far back you could remember or trace the family tree on either side.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, as far as tracing the ancestry on my father's side and my mother's side, all goes back to Mexico. My mother's side would be Coahuila, the province of Coahuila, the state of Coahuila in Mexico and my father's would be Zacatecas, Mexico. But as far as knowing, that would be the great grandparents, I never knew them except for one great grandmother on my father's side, but she died when I was very young. I just knew she was around. Other sisters and brothers have done research. But I think as far as directly knowing names and stuff, I'd have to look it up. As far as what's written down, and there's been several family tree works done, one of them done by my niece, Erin. But that's about as far back and I'd have to get you that paperwork. I think I have some of the paperwork, but like I said, as far as ancestry on both sides, my mother and father's side would be from Mexico. That's the best to my knowledge.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	What do you remember about your grandparents?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, what I remember about my mother's parents was just the farm life. They were ranchers in Malaga, New Mexico. I just remembered how rugged it was because there was no such thing as running water in those days on the ranch. I remember having to go haul water with my grandmother in her old truck and there was only one general store there. Typical, old time scenarios, just living out in the middle of nowhere, because Malaga was out in the middle of nowhere to a certain point, a certain degree. My father's parents, my grandmother was just a housewife, but my grandpa was a cook all his life. I remember him just after his events at the Country Club where he worked, which was pretty high status even for Carlsbad. But we'd all wait for him to come home and bring the leftovers from the restaurant so you'd wait. But we always had to wait and get the food after he fed his dogs because he had little weenie dogs that would get first choice. So that's what I remember about him. It's just they were very caring because we were a big family to speak of. I had three uncles and one aunt, but we all had big families. I just remember how they were real nurturing. That's what I remember. They were really solid in my growing up. I don't have any bad memories of them at all. They're all good memories which is something to say and missing them is really meaning you miss their conversations, their guidance and however minimal it was, it always seemed to make sense. It makes more sense now than it did then.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Mum mentioned the story that you told a while back, that I didn't remember, something about in Malaga, ghost horses?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, the stories about the Malaga, that was the headless horseman. But that was my uncle's version of scaring us, either making us try to go [00:05:00] to sleep. But I remember following horse tracks to the edge of a cliff and then nothing. Me and my cousin, Abel Duarte, which was my uncle's son, we're about a year apart. When we were very young on the farm, I remember going and following. It was a herd of white horses, was one of the occasions, and they just ran to this cliff and then there was no more tracks. I remember that vividly. The headless horseman thing was always, I don't know if it was an old myth or what. I know I believed it when I was young. Because we spent a lot of time out on the ranch, every weekend. In those days they had teachers' convention where you had almost a week and a half off of school. So I remember it pretty vividly, because when it was dark, I remember being afraid of the dark when we were out at the ranch, out at the farm, because he was out there. But that's just the way it is. But the white horses, and matter of fact, one of the things I remember is grandpa and grandma always had, it was like a small or probably a third the size of a football field, but it was a family garden for vegetable, watermelons, sugarcane, corn, but all the family would eat from it. The night that those horses came through, they trampled the whole garden and that's when we followed the tracks towards the river, which at that time seemed like five miles away. But in reality, it's probably only three-quarters of a mile, little over half a mile maybe from the ranch, which would have been the Pecos River at [inaudible 00:06:55] where we used to go swimming. We followed the tracks all the way to the river and then they disappeared. There was no more tracks, no horses, no tracks on the other side of the river so I don't know. I think they were there.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I remember being really little when you took me, and I didn't know if it was in Carlsbad or Malaga, where we went to pick cotton?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	That was at my Uncle Andy's ranch.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Where was it?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	That was in Malaga also. Well, Malaga itself is a community. The highway that goes between the town or the village at the time, just was the one that went to the Texas border. But there was lubin-- otis, lubin and Malaga and then the Texas state line. But all the Duarte's had property in Malaga and they were all cotton farmers. At that time, grandpa and grandparents had already passed away, and I had two uncles left in Malaga, and one of them was still farming. He used to raise watermelons. He's the one who used to raise. We've got a picture of you with a big watermelon, you could barely put your arms around it, that's how big the watermelon was. We also took a picture of you picking cotton because that's what we used to do when I was young.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I remember that.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Go out there and pick cotton.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Because I only remember grandma, I have very vivid memories of grandma, her picking me up from pre-school and watching Tom and Jerry. But I didn't know grandpa. If you could just tell me a little bit about what your parents were like, what you remember about them?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, what I remember about when I was growing up in Carlsbad was, I vaguely remember mom having to work, I think she worked at JC Penney's. But she was a housewife because when I was born, there was five of us or four of us. Then all the kids were born not in Carlsbad, but before we left Carlsbad, there were eight of us eventually, four boys and four girls. Mom was a housewife. Dad, when he came back from the service, he used to do a lot of woodworking.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	The bed headboard.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	The headboard for your bed, the table next to my chair. But before that, he was a cook when he got out of the service. In '45, I think two years before I was born, he got out of the service. He also did cooking. He was like a cook. Then he was self-taught, taught himself how to work construction and build homes. That's what dad did. He was very interested [00:10:00] in sports. That through the church, with the CYO, he had the baseball team at the church there at San Jose. He was real active in sports and kept us in sports all of us. Wiro and Lala, and all the sisters, they're the ones that started baseball and they kept on playing baseball the whole time we were in Carlsbad. That's where he was at. Then when he got into construction. He still followed us, me and my brothers, me and Eddie, and everything in sports. That's what I remember him for. He was just a hard worker. He always liked to do family things. He was really family oriented in the sense of going on picnics, or going out of town, or going just to the river fishing. That's what he liked to do. He was simple, very simple person. Pretty much how I am.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Yes, I was going to say, it sounds very familiar.FEMALE_1:	What are your parents names?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Lorenzo Zuniga Sr. and Anita Zuniga.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Anita Duarte, right? Duarte was her--Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Anita Duarte Zuniga.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Grandma?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Your grandma?Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Yeah. My grandma, Anita.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Anita. Well, she is the same way. When dad passed away, she kept on working and she never was one to not do anything because she was one girl and had four brothers. She was always battling. She was very strong willed person. She just kept working even after dad passed away. When she took care of you, you were probably two or three, I think. There again, she was another cook that worked at the school system at St. Charles right down from the house where we used to live but she was just a  seamstress. She taught my sister Rita how to sew, and I think all the girls knew how to sew, even I knew how to sew. But I remember her when we were growing up, she'd make out clothes with exceptional pants. She'd always make our shirts, and she always made the girls' dresses and stuff but I used to hate it because she used to dress us alike, me and my brother, Eddie, so I'd always find a way to tear my shirt so I wouldn't have to wear the same shirt. But that's what she was like. She was just a hard worker because you can imagine growing up or being raised with four boys on a ranch, I think her great escape was when she met dad and moved to Carlsbad. But still her ties to the ranch or to the farm were still there because I think we were all tied to the farm. Every chance we had, we were always at the farm. Even Carlsbad in those days was very small, population wise, and you knew everybody just pretty much who we stayed on our part of town and everybody stayed on the other part of town. We lived on the on the Calle del Diablo. They called it on main street means the street of the devil but it was fun growing up on Carlsbad. That's what I remembered about it that there was more fun on the farm.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Yeah.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	There's more to it.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Why did you guys move to Albuquerque?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	The economy I think, in those days. I never understood it for a while but when dad finally explained it, it was because he was traveling up here to work in construction, and what he ended up doing was getting his contractor's license. Then in early '59, Sheila was here. Sheila was here in school at UNM, and she spent the first year here. Then in '59, he decided to move the whole family up, and that was what brought everybody to Albuquerque because the work was here. Then in '59 and '60, that's when Albuquerque started growing, and Carlsbad wasn't growing. It was just like I said, very small and there was no work, and at that time, he had eight kids. Mom, I don't remember her working. I think she worked all the way up through to about '58. I think that was when Ricardo was born. Ricardo was born in '57, I think. Yeah. He was two years old when we moved up here or something like that. But I think she had already stopped working but then [00:15:00] that's what brought us up.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Did you miss Carlsbad?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I missed it a lot because it was small. I missed the river. We were only like 200 yards from the Pecos River so I'd go fishing any time I wanted. I went fishing every day pretty much. The community we lived in, it was a black community. There was like three other Mexican families there, but we knew everybody. I went to a small Catholic school, and there was I think 12 students in the whole class but you're only in one room for all classes all day long with the nuns, so that wasn't fun.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Who is your best friend from down there? Sweeney?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Sweeney, a little black kid that we grew up. Wallace Humphrey was his name. But when we were really young, mom used to leave us with his mom, Rina Humphrey. We just grew up together and he was a year older than me, but as soon as we could get to the river by ourselves, we were gone, and that's where we spent our whole childhood at the river, and just her going to the dump and collecting copper scraps to sell. Then we'd go fishing and then we used to end up catching a bunch of carp that way but then we'd sell them. We'd sell the cap to the neighbors and we just put them in a wagon and go sell them. That's all we do all day long. Of course, we do our chores but we were the only ones in the neighborhood that had a grass yard, it was a big grass yard, and we used to had to mow it with the hand mower before dad would let us go fishing, so we'd get it done and then we'd go fishing, but he was my best friend. He's still my best friend. I just haven't seen him in a while.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	What are places that you remember in Albuquerque hanging out when you were in middle school, high school, and growing up?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, the only place I can remember that we're used to hang out, that was Vip's Big Boy on Central. That was when I was at high land then because when I was in junior high, I was in sports so we couldn't drive so we didn't really hang out anywhere. The only place we used to hang out was it used to be the old Heights Community Center and the Heights Community Center's still there which CNN is now pretty much taken all that whole area but I didn't really hang out anywhere. I was too much too involved with sports the whole time, and ever since junior high when I moved here when I was in 7th grade and I was just culture shocked to go from 12 kids in the school to 25 in a class and a different classroom every day. That was at Jefferson Junior High, and that was crazy, it took me a month to figure out where the classes were.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Are there specific places that you remember even after high school and that just aren't around anymore? Any buildings or area like I remember the drive through movies.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Yes.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	That used to be around and they're gone?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	See in those days, Johnson Jim was very small and then the football stadium used to be on Yale and Central, just East of Hogen Hall or East of Yale, it used to be the football field. Naca Central was only two lanes, so that's the only thing. There was just like I said, Vip's is no longer but just plays a line of restaurant, just things like that but nothing major. It was in the process of being built, everything was coming in that's not tall enough.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	So how did you first start going up to Northern New Mexico? To Tierra Amarilla and Canjilon?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I went in 1970 on a fishing trip with Gordon Smith, and I'm trying to remember who else there was, Kenny Salazar. We decided to go fishing. I had never been North of Santa Fe. I think I had been up to Lagunitas Lake once with some guys that used to work with dad fishing. If I can't fish, then I'm going nowhere. You know that.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I know.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	We had gone fishing up to Lagunitas Lake to try to find out Lagunitas Lake. Well, we couldn't find them so we spent the night, ended up going to Chama because Gordy knew this place, they're in La Puente from Nicholas Lopez's road.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	In Casablanca?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	The road that you go down in Casablanca, so we drove down that road and fished there for a while. I had never been in Chama, I had never been to [00:20:00] Tierra Amarilla. Then from there, we ended up at Navajo, and Navajo Lake because Gordon caught a big fish there at that big hole.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Yeah.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	We were at Navajo then we went down to Coopers, and we're fishing by the swinging bridge, and I saw a heist plumbing and heating truck.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	That's right. So you had been working for-Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	No. I hadn't seen Clyde since I went to Vietnam in '65. This is six years later. I happen to see the heist truck and I saw Clyde, and he was there, and I hadn't seen Clyde like I said, since I went to the service. Because we both went in the service together but they wouldn't take him because of his asthma. So I saw Clyde and of course, we started drinking and that was the end of it. Then I stayed there. That's when I went while I was there already, then came back to Albuquerque, and we just hung out together. But I never went back.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Is that how you got into plumbing?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Yeah. Well, that's even later. It wasn't even then that I got into it because I was doing construction. That's what led up to me when I broke my back in early '71. But what happened was, when I broke my back, and that was, like I said, early '71. So it had to have been early '70 when I run into Clyde up there. Then we came back in November of '71, it's when they operated on my back, when they did the fusion. From there, right after thanksgiving, a couple of weeks later when they let me out of the hospital, Clyde took me up to Alvarado because he had a cabin there, just to recuperate, because I couldn't do anything. I had a chest brace on and everything and that's how I ended up at the Alvarado Lake.FEMALE_1:	I'm sorry. Well, how did you know Clyde from before?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Clyde and I played against each other since seventh grade at Jefferson. I was at Jefferson Junior High School.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	In baseball, right?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	In baseball and he was at Garfield. He played second base and I played third base. In those days, there was not that many schools, so we always played against each other. Eventually, I ended up going to Highland for two years, Highland High School, but in 1965, we moved to the valley to-- as a matter of fact up by Corrales right there by Alamilla where the old Walgreens used to be. The house is still there in Cielo Vistas, the name of the street. I ended up going to Valley High School, so Clyde and I ended up playing together for Valley in 1965.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	You guys were in the Allstate, and you won State.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	We were All-Staters together and we were on State that year and that's how I met Clyde. I'd known Clyde since seventh grade. But we played together and so we just hung out together because he loved fishing and I love fishing. Then like I said, we went in the service after that. He ended up going to college because the service wouldn't take him and I ended up going in the service. Like I said, when I ran back into him, this is six years later when I was recuperating, he asked me if I wanted to do some plumbing because they wouldn't let me work construction anymore because I had broke my back. Then they wouldn't bind me to work what I was doing. So I said, sure I'll try it. At that time, they had gotten a contract to work on the Chama Elementary School and high school there in TA.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Is that what kept you there?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	That's what kept me there. This is a year later. This is '72, when I was already being able to walk and not depending on the brace. I still had to wear the back brace, but he asked me if I wanted to get into plumbing and I said no, I'll try it. I've been doing it ever since.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Here you are, you're in plumbing over 30 years later. Because you guys ended up marrying sisters, my mom and my aunt Dolores. Who met who first and how did that happen?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I met your mom at Alvarado Lake, fishing. I had seen her and we were over at the State Park side and I remember we had seen her. Clyde and I had gone around for some reason and she was with Ray Garcia, but they were fishing all the time. I'd always seen them in the truck. So it was like a big [00:25:00] sand bank or something like that and that's where I saw your mom. But I had seen her for about a month and then that's where I met her. Matter of fact, I asked because I had two big fish I'd caught at the Marina and I saw across from the Marina that they were over there so Clyde and I drove around all the way to the Marina side because I knew Ray, I hadn't even met Ray, but I knew him and then heard from all these rumors that who he was and stuff. So I didn't know. But she was up there with Francis. They had just come back from cross-country skiing. The day before the cross-country skiing, I remember Francis being burnt, really burnt red from cross-country skiing and your mom asked me what I was using for bait and I said I was using minerals, because I had a bucket of minerals. I asked her if she wanted the minerals, she said yes. I asked her, do you want a union or non-union mineral? She said non-union. So I gave her that, now we've been together ever since that time so that's how I met her. What happened was Clyde now are still together, but see, originally Clyde had met Angie first.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Really? Her other sister.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	The other sister. So they were hooked up for a while.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I didn't know that.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	We used to go to the cabin and Angie would come down and stay at the cabin and Clyde was there. We saw your mom was trying to match make that. Well, we didn't even know if we were going to last then, but it was just like one of those things then. Because Dolores had already been up there, she was teaching up there.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	That's right, in Canjilon.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	In Canjilon and to be honest, I really don't remember how Dolores and Clyde ended up together.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	They got married first, right?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	No, we did.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	You did?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	They got married two or three years later. But anyway. So I don't even remember how they got together. But guys, I think it was that Angie was in Denver or in Conifer at that time. Because we even went out to Conifer to cut wood for her one time. But Angie had too many different boyfriends so it was never a done deal.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	So how did you and mom decide to get married? How did that all go down?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I don't know, it was interesting to, because when the courthouse raid in Tierra Amarilla in '67 happened, I was in Vietnam at the time and your mom was working for Reyes Lopez at the time. I don't know what it was, it was just being outdoors that we were both outdoor people. We had views about the civil rights movement, we had views about the Chicano movement and The Raza Unida and stuff like that, that we just had a lot of in-common stuff for some reason. I don't know why or what brought us together, it just seems like there's something that brought us together for a reason in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't happen that way. It's weird the way it happened. Because when I first got there everybody thought I was a Arab because my hair was long and I had a big bushy beard.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	You're dark skin.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Really dark. I was darker than anybody out there. So I don't know what it was. We just decided that we had to be together for some reason and it worked out.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	So my next question was, how did you guys choose my name when I was born?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	What?Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	How did you and mom come up with my name?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Well, we didn't know if you were going to be a girl or a boy or what, we didn't know because we don't have to go through all that stuff. When you were born, I remember just telling her right away, I said I want to name her Sabina and she agreed because I was really close with my grandmother and I just saw what she went through for some reason, I remember your grandma said, ""Why did we give you such a heavy name?"" Because Sabina was a the translation of Sabino you know, it's hard, Sabino was a hard wood. It's a tree. It's a type of cedar tree that, you see in the Georgia O'Keeffe paintings all the time, real twisted normally, but it's real hard. [00:30:00] I never wanted to name you after Anita or something like that. I don't know what it was or just something just instinctively said let's name her Sabina and she said okay, so, that's where we came up with Sabina Maria for your mom and that's where it came from and just I was real closer to grandma.FEMALE_1:	Was your grandmother named Sabina?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	She was a Sabina Gomez Duarte. But you just going to imagine like there again on the farm and my uncle, her husband, I mean, my grandpa Jose, he was a tall man. He was almost seven foot tall. He was like 6-7, 6'8. He was a big man, huge and then raising a family out there like that. She was mean. She was a mean one. Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I remember watching a video one time about the state of Coahuila and there's was actually a river running through it called the Rio Sabina.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I can imagine it comes up.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	So now I want to know what are some of your favorite memories that are just with me and you, from whatever.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	I think when we get to go fishing for some reason I am so tied to water because when we ended up with a place in the La Puente, it's about the same distance as it was in [inaudible 00:31:27] where I grew up and we could walk to the river and that to me, other than when you were in high school, all your accomplishes, I think your accomplishments at Menaul were, you never forget them. Your basketball and just everything you did in high school because you've always just excelled at what you want to do and that's what makes it worthwhile watching you do what you do because once you make up your mind you do it and your mom's that way, when she decides to do something, she'll go right after it. You have a lot of your mom in you. But I think the best times are when we're fishing, just you and me and it didn't matter if we catch anything. It's not like I have to get something to eat, but I know I can if I have to. That's something that, because you've been fishing with me since you were four and I think that's what I miss the most, you being gone and of course that's not going up a lot and it's hard. That's what I miss the most. I miss fishing just period in general. Those are the better times. I remember the time, we went up there for four days and we didn't even get a bite, that was a good thing. Those for me are the best times. There's always birthdays, but birthdays are boring, they are just birthdays. I hope not like Floyd, he has a heart attack. Every time he has birthday, he has a heart attack, but he's always been that way.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Yeah. Those are definitely my favorite memories too. One of my favorite pictures is when we're fishing on the rocks and I'm in my big blue jacket. I definitely have a lot of clear memories. One thing I've always wanted to know, and I was hoping you'd tell me where it started is where your obsession with golf came from and how that has developed because you've turned into a pretty amazing golf player.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	That started in probably '76 or '77, you weren't even born yet. I think it was a year before you're born, '78. I was working with Billy Ramirez at the youth detention center there on Edith and Menaul or Edith and Candeleria and he asked me one day if I played golf and I said I have played, I've hit ball now, I've never played around a golf because the last time I even was on a golf course that I remember when I was 12 with my Tio Chito, that he played golf and I just went around with him. He let me hack a couple balls when I was 12. But in high school, we'd go to the driving range and just hit balls. I never played around a golf and Billy took me to play with the Madrugadores as his guest one Sunday. I've been hooked ever since.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	How long have the Madrugadores been around?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	They were around 10 years before I joined them. They'd been around since the late '60s. It's just addicting to the point where anything to do with athletics to a certain point but golf, just to me, golf is like fishing.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I was just going say, do you find it similar to fishing? Because it's one person?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	It's you and [00:35:00] the golf course and that's it. Like if you're fishing depends if they want to bite it or not. If you're golfing you're the only one to blame and that's how I learned, I just read books and that's why I watch it.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	I just want to thank you for sharing all these memories and it's really interesting to hear. I don't know if you had any last minute favorite stories or things that you remember that were passed down, traditions?Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	The only tradition that I can think of that's constant in both sides of the family is eating and cooking. That seems to be the constant. I remember having matansas and just there again, especially at the farm. It seems like everything I've ever done in my life or even now revolves around growing up at the farm. The matansas getting the corn to eat, getting the squash, the calabazas whatever we had to eat, it was all grown there. The pig, we slaughtered the pig and eat the pig. I'd go chicharrones, tamales, tripitas. Everything was eaten, everything was used. That's why we all hang out in the kitchen. That's both sides of the family, we're always in the kitchen because everybody's always cooking or eating. When dad had the baseball team, this was something that, when people from  Marfa or Midland, Texas would come to play that weekend everybody stay in the backyard with colchones and sleeping bags. They didn't have that many good sleeping bags. That's all I remember from growing up and to this day, that's the favorite part. When you get together, you eat and like I said, there's no real one specific story I can think of but it was all based around eating and just gathering, just getting family together. That was it because we all had big families. So it was nothing to do and the best way to do it was to eat. That's the best thing about it.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Thank you.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	You are welcome.Sabina Maria Zuniga Varela:	Happy birthday.Lorenzo Zuniga Jr:	Thank you. See just another birthday.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
MBY007286,"Michael:	[00:00:00] My name is Michael Grabowski. I'm 56 years old. Today's date is December 11th, 2010. We are in Waco, Texas. My relationship to the partner is roommate, friend, and family.MALE_1:	I'm Humberto Estrada. I'm 40. Today is December the 11th, 2010. We are in Waco, Texas. My relationship to my partner, he's my roommate, my family, and my friend. We're going to be talking about your health. I want to ask you about your Parkinson's. I know you got diagnosed over 10 years ago.Michael:	Yeah.MALE_1:	I want you to tell me a little bit about your illness.Michael:	Well, maybe how it started?MALE_1:	Yeah.Michael:	I had taken a fall. I fell off a chair, replacing a heater filter about 12 years ago now. I broke my elbow and knocked unconscious from that. Let's take things from that. Although I didn't have any symptoms at the time, about nine months later, I would notice when I walked my middle toe, my left foot would drag the carpet, and other people noticed I wasn't using my left arm very much, which I thought was because I had broken it and maybe done enough rehab with it. This time my body wasn't operating quite up to par. I went to the doctor and he tried to relate it to that fall on my back and sent me to a neurosurgeon to get some neurosurgery. The neurosurgeon couldn't find anything to surgery. He examined me more closely and sent me to a neurologist. Backup a bit, before he sent me to the neurologist, we did brain scans for multiple sclerosis, for brain tumor, for a number things that any number which might have killed me very shortly. When he did send me to the neurologist, the neurologist said, ""I think it might be Parkinson's,"" and he gave me medication for it which took care of the symptoms. That's how they diagnosed it. That was all it was. I can take a drug for it and have been on the drug ever since.MALE_1:	Yeah. Right now, I see that you're going through one of your racing episodes.Michael:	Yeah.MALE_1:	When you're going through your racing episodes or the opposite of that, does that scare you?Michael:	Sometimes. More now than it used to. What I call racing is an overreaction to the medication. I get extra movements and twitches of the head and my mind races ahead as well. This has been around ever since I had been taking the drugs in varying degrees, but not as often as it is now. It's frightening because I don't think it affects my mind when it's happening, but I lose sense of time when I'm in here. I don't know how long things take. I might explain too -- Let me back up again. My type of Parkinson's, it's not like Michael J. Fox's where he moves constantly with the twitches. Mine is a lock-up. My muscles stop moving, and I might be walking in and then suddenly can't walk anymore, because my muscles have stopped. It's not because there's anything wrong with muscles. It's communication from the brain to the muscles, that's the problem. They don't hear what I want them to do, my legs or my arms. The medication is to let me move and so I can walk and do things. It's scary.MALE_1:	Since you've gotten diagnosed, [00:05:00] do you look at your life differently now than before?Michael:	Yes, I think.MALE_1:	How?Michael:	When I first got diagnosed, I was married. I was married to a lady older than me. I was closeted. I was gay but closeted. Nobody knew. When I got diagnosed with my Parkinson's, it made me think about my life and where I was headed with it. Made me think about my wife's life, our life together. I had a full shot of my mind since she was 15 years older than me, that she would die before I did. After she did, she died, I could live my life, I could have my gay life. That's a silly thought.  That's what I was leaning on. The Parkinson's is going to change that and suddenly, I wasn't sure I was going to have much life after her. I might be the one to go first. That put things in a new perspective. To cut the long story short, you know some of this story already.MALE_1:	Right. Yeah. We've been together for a while.Michael:	I had to find a way out. I left home, a year later got divorced. Yes, it changed my life. That was because of the diagnosis.MALE_1:	Right.FEMALE_1:	If I can ask, what was your way out? You said, Michael, you had to find a way out. What was your way out?Michael:	I was a pretty big coward back then. I couldn't dare hurt my wife. Not even if it was the right thing to do. I couldn't do it.MALE_1:	Has Parkinson's, having this disease, have you learned anything from it? I mean as far as how to live life or maybe give to the community?Michael:	I'll say, lately, yes. These things are in my mind very much lately. I went over the edge of at first, I think, when I came out, when I left home, I didn't know what to expect in coming out, in the job or personal life or in anything. I bought a book, ""Now That I'm Out, What Do I Do?"" I still had this question after the book. Yes, that's how I've learned. I've learned that what happens to me affects a lot of people around me.MALE_1:	Yeah.Michael:	I didn't know how much. I didn't know how much.MALE_1:	When have you felt alone the most?Michael:	The most alone I felt was right at the beginning, going through all the tests. My wife was not -- [00:10:00] Very sympathetic, very caring, but didn't know how to share it. I didn't know how to ask her to share with me. I went to these tests for brain scan, for tumors, for MS, and it was when I was wondering, what they're going to find, am I going to die? I felt very alone. She was not there for it, maybe because I didn't ask, maybe because she didn't know how. But I went through those tests alone and I was very scared.MALE_1:	Since you've been diagnosed, what are some of the most proudest moments in your life?Michael:	You're so funny. I'm proud that I can hold my own in a pool tournament.MALE_1:	I know you scare some of the guys sometimes.Michael:	Yeah. Well, talking about, even if they're not scared, I know that they're not scared, I --MALE_1:	They underestimate you.Michael:	Most of the time they do. They underestimate me once or twice. If I pull the walker out, my drugs would stop working, somewhat, and I'll be looking around the table, pull the walker out, and that intimidates some of them.MALE_1:	Right. Well, I know that sometimes there is moments where I'll be out there with you -- When you were playing pool this one time, and it reminded me of one of the stories that you told me several years ago that you were out at a pool tournament, and you pulled your medication out because there are certain times that you have to have your medication. You told me that someone in the club or wherever you were at, thought you were doing something other than medicating for your condition. How do you feel about that?Michael:	That was a raw deal. I was in Dallas, gone to karaoke bar, I'd never been there before. I like to sing karaoke in-between pool games. There was a lady there who asked me to dance, wanted to talk. I like dance. That was okay. So I danced with her, we talked for a little while. I showed her my drugs, because she says she was an alcoholic and was recovering from that, but she was drinking. I share with her that I had my drugs, that's why I didn't have any drinks. I showed them to her, and we talked some more about drugs and drinking. Then we danced one more time, and then I went to go to play pool with this guy who came over. He wanted to play some nine ball. I really minded playing nine ball at that club. I want to play him. She wanted me to come over to play pool with her and her friend. They weren't pool players, and I think they wanted to take me home, frankly. I said no, I don't want to go dance, I want to play pool with this guy here, and she got pissed at me. She went to the bartender and said, ""That guy is trying to sell me drugs."" That started a chain where the manager came to talk to me and the bartender too had me at the end of the bar, and I'm showing my pills, but I didn't have my prescriptions with me. They're back in the hotel room in Dallas. So I got kicked out.MALE_1:	How did that make you feel?Michael:	I was angry. I was angry. I was in my racing mode. One of the things that facilitates the racing mode is being nervous anyway, or being angry will do it, lack of sleep. I get angry.MALE_1:	Is there any way you can control it? Like maybe --Michael:	Short period. When I do pool shot, I can take a breath, I can lay down my pool shot, I stop all motion for about 30 seconds, and make my shot, and then do it all over again next shot, because it comes back. All the extra motion, the dancing room.MALE_1:	Right.Michael:	[00:15:00] I'm nervous right now.FEMALE_1:	I was wondering Michael, what about that night? What about that episode made you angry?Michael:	Well, she lied on me. That pissed me off. In all places I've ever been, I've never had anybody question my integrity in that way.MALE_1:	Right.Michael:	Of course, in other places here in Austin, I don't know everywhere, but I do everywhere now, before I play there, I go to talk to the manager, talk to the bartender and say, ""I'm taking these drugs for the Parkinson's. I want you to know this is what I look like when this happens."" I fill them in, and I don't have any problem after that. I didn't do that there. A little bit angry at myself. l don't take care of all the basics. But she lied on me, and that did take me off.MALE_1:	You know all my nieces and my nephews. They all grew up, I guess, with you. You've had life experience. You're going through this condition. They always ask about you, they want to know what is it that you have. I usually tell them what you have, but I don't go into detail. What's some advice that you would give the kids, your friends about life? Words of wisdom.Michael:	Words of wisdom. Not the words of wisdom I follow. What you do today is important. Even if it's not something that's event changing. It's important inside yourself. This has importance inside yourself. You change with the things that you do. Keep your own integrity. You have to look inside and look for things that are true, and follow those things, follow those paths.MALE_1:	Is this coming from the actor? Because you used to act, or is it coming from the person who doesn't act anymore?Michael:	Person who doesn't act anymore. I forgot a lot of things. Years ago, I said I went over the edge when I came out, and I hurt you, I hurt myself, I hurt other people and my self-worth went away. I used to be angry because I would sell everything, play pool, or to a karaoke bar. Not because it's intending anything inherently wrong with them, but because that's all I did. I was retired. That's all I did. I wouldn't want to talk about it right now. But the thing is, I would do that, but I wouldn't do anything else. I would go exercise. I wouldn't eat and go to sleep. I would stay up 40 hours in a row. Echoes are pretty hard to go to sleep because I wake up feeling paralyzed and afraid. So I don't I like to sleep.MALE_1:	Now, I mean, there's a lot of [00:20:00] research going on with Parkinson's and all those neurological related disease. You know that we all must return to the Earth. What do you think the future holds for, for you? How do you want to be remembered?Michael:	I thought that as I am, I let somebody he will go by him. I resigned myself, had free time is out there. I thought my end already. I'm going to end up alone in a box. Sometimes some kind of elder care place and diner. I remember, I think I've changed it, so I don't think it's too late. A lot of time go by and a lot of people go by. But I have another person in my life now, another lover who sees past Parkinson's to me, bus is still affected by it. It's easier for me to see through him what I do to fix him and his life, make him wait for things whenever I'm waiting for pills to take effect, or when I don't get ready on time because I didn't schedule things properly, or when I'm racing like this, and we go out with friends, I can't be as responsible as I want to, because I'm freaked out in my mind. How it affects you, how it affects the new roommate who's there, how it affected everybody around me before.MALE_1:	What do you wish? What do you hope? What do you wish this research that's going on with the Parkinson's, what do you wish would happen with that?Michael:	The stem-cell research?MALE_1:	Yeah.Michael:	That'd be great, because then I wouldn't have to do anything. Just go get an operation, put some brains cell. Here, they grow new [inaudible 00:23:05] , little area of the brain that's called, it makes dopamine in your brain. Then I wouldn't have to do anything, that's easy way out to that. I use the drug therapy. I'm dependent on it, I would be afraid to give it up, but I would give it up to give it up. But I have been able to make myself do the things I need to do because I think the self-worth has not been there. There's one thing that was coming back, trying to find your true path of what are the things that are true for you inside, get back on that road. Maybe that's not too late for me to do that. Find the things that biodiversity on. Don't let us take the people around me, the people that I loved.MALE_1:	You can live comfortable.Michael:	I want to be hopeful, yes. I want to be racing all time. It's not pleasant.MALE_1:	Not only to live comfortable, but to live as healthy as possible.Michael:	Oh, boy, yeah. So what I want to do.MALE_1:	Is there anything that you've never told me, but you want to tell me now?Michael:	[00:25:00] There's a change of anything in a way that I was living my life. I look back on it now and I really liked to.MALE_1:	Well, I'm still here.Michael:	I'm sorry. I haven't told you, I'm sorry.MALE_1:	Well, I've always told you that. I'm going to try to help you as much as I can, and of course, I'm going to do that with your permission. I always think that, yeah, family and friends always hurt each other but they always come back to each other.Michael:	You haven't left. You've threatened to, many times, but you never left.MALE_1:	I guess, one last thing that I want to ask you is, is there something about me that you've always wanted to know but you've never asked?Michael:	One of my principles has been to let people have their privacy. So there are many things I want to ask about. I'll wait for them to elaborate on. I can't think of one right now. I wanted to.MALE_1:	Because all this time that we've been friends, I don't think you've really have ever asked me anything about myself other than whatever I tell you that I'm working on, or I'm doing, or I'm studying, or where I'm going, so I figured that maybe you would have a question that you'd want to ask that you just never been able to. Maybe the opportunity hasn't presented itself and I figured this would be the perfect time.Michael:	Are you happy or are on you on your path to happiness?MALE_1:	I'm going to say I'm comfortable. I'm still looking for happiness. Yeah.Michael:	[inaudible 00:28:51] You have a circle friends that you see but I don't ask about them. I don't want to be nosy. I know you date once in a while, and I won't ask you about that because I don't want to be nosy. That one relationship that I talk too much, it was ignorance, it was not, what was I suppose to say. Don't attribute something to anger which can be explained by stupidity. It was not something I did, retribution were out of anger. I was too stupid that I talk too much. [00:30:00] I'm sorry for that. I'm not sure it would work out anyway. I'd rather it wouldn't. If I can keep my finger out of pie. To know that you're comfortable, that's good.MALE_1:	Right.Michael:	I don't want to think about things, I mean, I'm sure you won't be happy. I think I want everybody be angry with me ever, because I -- FEMALE_1:	Why did you want people to be angry at you, Michael?Michael:	Because it's selfish not to. When you have a family, to come out gay, and get divorced, and be part of some things about my job too. Those people. I have a family left me all behind. They said they're mad at me for doing that. Nobody was mad and everybody was very understanding.MALE_1:	But I think that's why your mom and dad, I mean, they had health conditions and the community that was around them supported them and tried to make them comfortable at all times.Michael:	My father made my mother's so comfortable. She actually couldn't do anything for herself. He started doing more and more for her and she couldn't do anything herself. He's gone so much, he died. I think I'm stressed of it. So peace to him for that. I see myself in my mother. I see myself in my mother, not taking care of myself. I'm not getting he's done. I don't mind that when someone does do something for me. I thought I could be her. I don't want to be like that. But I need to push it further and start taking care of it, not being pissed about it, as she was, she just accepted it, and my dad accepted it. He complained but he didn't know anything about it. I keep it now that I need to do this, I need to do that. A big need-a-list. I need to do that. I need exercise. I need to guest here on you. I got a big need-a-list. I'm not taking care of all that yet. I'm paying here more and more of it.MALE_1:	What do you think in the next couple of years that maybe you'll be able to streamline a healthy routine to live with your condition a little easier?Michael:	I don't know. I think I'm on the right path, but I've been off the path for so long. It's hard to -- I have all these bad habits, I need to shed, and it's hard to replace them with good habits.MALE_1:	What would you tell someone else that is in my situation that has a family member that has Parkinson's? What would you like for them to take with them from this interview?Michael:	Don't be angry with them. I think for me, it's anger. Mine, they came around me, it affects me so much. I've affected my body so much more than used to because of Parkinsons, maybe because of the drugs, for whatever reason. It's very hard to deal with it, not being angry to myself. I could be angry with you. Here in Migos I get something harshly. If you're angry at me then I can get angry back. It feeds on itself. In the racing state I'm very much would like [00:35:00] babbling up and defend myself. You and I should be defended.MALE_1:	So you were telling them not to be angry at them?Michael:	No. They're not doing things. You got to be angry at them, you got to get their attention, and my dad would be angry at my mom, and they would argue, but it wasn't healthy anger. It wasn't something productive, it wasn't something that led to somewhere. It would only led to him capitulating and doing whatever it is she wanted to do that was unhelpful. It was eat wrong for diabetes, or to not walk.FEMALE_1:	What was the turnaround for you Michael, when you said that now you're on the right path, that you're off the path. So what changed, or what made you change?Michael:	Starting another relationship, having another lover. But this time a monogamous relationship and realizing he's doing that for a while, that's where I am too. I'm a monogamous person, and I wasn't doing it all those years. By starting that relationship with Kelly, that was a turnaround. That was real turnaround.MALE_1:	I hope that this was a learning experience for you because I know it was for me. I know I'm still learning and I know I'm still trying to get comfortable with the changes that are happening to you. I know for myself what I'd like to let somebody else, another caretaker know that if they're caring for somebody with a health condition that not only affects their physical health, but their spiritual health and their emotional health, that they're not alone.Michael:	Several times when you threatened to leave, I thought of how to be alone. Half of people go after all. That's what I'm saying. That's someone there. I can't find the words inside to say.MALE_1:	I want them to know that it doesn't necessarily have to be a family member, but it can be a friend. It could be somebody you meet at a pool tournament, it could be the next door neighbor.Michael:	Treat the people that treat the Parkinson's perfect or any other disease I think, as normal as I'm a normal person as you can. Don't let me get away with anything. Don't let me get away feeling sorry for myself. My wife's mother did note I am good at that. I'm assuming that if she was, let's try to put [inaudible 00:39:25] and people with Parkinson's, don't do that, don't feel sorry for yourself. I think I've already feeling sorry for myself, but haven't been able to make the next thing to feel like I need to preserve me, I need a reason. I need a reason [00:40:00] to take care of it, and living alone without people around you is no reason to do it right. No reason to try and take care of things. That's a path to death. That's a path to just letting it take over. You don't have to do anything, it'll take you eventually. Don't have to do something. I do not think for a long time and I think I'm on the path to doing something, I'm doing some things, it's not everything yet, it's all right.MALE_1:	Some things take time and some things just need to be changed.Michael:	It's hard to see it, yeah.FEMALE_1:	We have about a minute left and I was wondering if there is something you would like Michael to ask you about, or if you would like to tell him something that he hasn't asked, but you'd like him to.MALE_1:	One thing that I want you to know is that all these years you've always helped me financially, and I think that that was always good, but I think that sometimes you've always forgotten to support me in a more emotional way because, you know, money isn't everything. I wish sometimes you were there emotionally rather than financially, because it's been hard to see you progress through your Parkinson's and that's always a challenge for me. So my way of getting through it is going to work at the why, and finding my other family, my other friends, and my faith. So I want you to know that.Michael:	I hear you. I think I say I'm sorry to much. But I wish I had been there too. I think I misinterpreted a lot of your anger.MALE_1:	Well, we have room to grow, and to grow and to learn. So hopefully, we can do that for the next 10 years, 15 years, whatever. However long we are given.Michael:	I'll try. I'll try harder.MALE_1:	That's good to hear.Michael:	I've tried harder, I know it's not enough, but I want you to sometimes recognize some progress that I have. I know there's a lot of things that still should be doing, but I'm doing much more now than I was. I think I'm doing much, much better emotionally, physically maybe, not as much, I think I'm doing better, and I want some acknowledgment.MALE_1:	I see you trying hard.Michael:	I'm not a bastard for doing anything out of failure for not doing anything. Sometimes I thought I was evil, or bad, or [00:45:00] not worthy, because of these things. Then I thought of it then just a failure at a lot of it, I just fail a lot of it. That's something I can take care of, but I can't change being a bastard, but I can change being a failure. So I've recently been seeing everything of myself as a failure right now than anything else, that I can recover from that.MALE_1:	Well, let's try.FEMALE_1:	Any last minute words that you'd like to say to each other before we wrap up in a few seconds?MALE_1:	Let's keep trying.Michael:	Thanks for being around, and thanks for still being there.MALE_1:	You're welcome.Michael:	After all this.MALE_1:	You are welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
MBY007312,"Santos Martinez:	[00:00:00] I'm Santos Martinez. I'm 63 years old and I'm in Waco, Texas.Irma Lopez:	My name is Irma Lopez. My age is 39. Today is December 16th of 2010 and we're in Waco, Texas.Santos Martinez:	I don't know exactly what our relationship is, other than friends, and we're both part of McLennan Community College. So as we start it, Mar, why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are and go ahead and tell your story that way.Irma Lopez:	Okay. Like I say, I'm Irma. I come from Mexico. I came to the United States when I was 14 and I've been living in Waco since then.Santos Martinez:	What part of Mexico are you from?Irma Lopez:	I am from Rioverde, San Luis Potosi.Santos Martinez:	You were 14 when you came. Did you come to Waco at a time?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. Straight to Waco.Santos Martinez:	What brought you to Texas?Irma Lopez:	Work. I wanted to work to help my family. I've tried to work in Mexico, but pay was very little, so I thought that dollars were a lot more. So that's when I decided to come to the US.Santos Martinez:	Did you come from a large family?Irma Lopez:	Yes. I live with my two parents and my five brothers and sisters.Santos Martinez:	Are they still in Mexico?Irma Lopez:	No. They're all living here. My parents still live in Mexico. They just come to visit every once in a while. But all my brothers and sisters are here, and now we're six, with me, seven, so it kept growing.Santos Martinez:	Are you-all pretty close?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, we are.Santos Martinez:	We were talking earlier about your sons and your husband. So tell us a little bit about your family now.Irma Lopez:	I have two boys, which I call my miracle boys, because I had a very hard time while I was pregnant with them and before that, I had a lot of miscarriages. So I call them my two miracle boys. One is 18, the other one is 11. I've been married for 22 years, which is a long time. I think we've got a good family.Santos Martinez:	You've been here while now, so what do you consider yourself?Irma Lopez:	I still consider myself Mexican, even though I'm a naturalized citizen. I think that is very important for my kids, although they're born here, to know that they come from Mexican parents because my husband is Mexican too.Santos Martinez:	Do you still speak Spanish at home or what is your language at home?Irma Lopez:	Spanish, all the time. Yeah, at home, we speak Spanish.Santos Martinez:	You said that knowing that they were Mexican was important to you. Is maintaining your language and your customs important as well?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, although we have to adapt to this country, so a lot of it, it's passing slowly. I can see that because a lot of things, we just adapt to whatever the culture here is. That is certain now that I think about it.Santos Martinez:	I'm curious now, what music do you listen to?Irma Lopez:	Spanish.Santos Martinez:	When you say Spanish, what music under that umbrella? Are you talking Mariachi? Are you talking norteño, or?Irma Lopez:	I like pop, but in here, there's not that much of it. You can't hear that much of it. So I have to settle for norteño.Santos Martinez:	What about your kids? What do they listen to?Irma Lopez:	They listen [00:05:00] to English.Santos Martinez:	They're fluent in Spanish so they can still talk to their grandparents?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	That's something that's interesting to note that they have assimilated and become part of this country.Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	What traditions are you interested in keeping? You talked about the Spanish and that been important to you. So are there some traditions associated with that that you'd like to keep?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. I think the Christmas tradition to do tamales. That's a good tradition, I think because the whole family gets together and work at it. Instead of just bringing them to the table and getting together to eat them. I think the best part is to get together and talk about stuff. It don't matter what stuff you bring, but just talk about stuff.Santos Martinez:	So it's the family getting together to do that, it's a family project?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	So everybody participates in doing that?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	Even in that, I think you see the changes in generations. There's a play that's called Las Nuevas Tamaleras that traces that and it's so interesting to see what the great-grandparents did, what the grandparents did, and so forth, and and how, in the process of trying to maintain those things becoming a assimilated, you see all these changes. I'm sure you've seen some of the same things in your own family.Irma Lopez:	Yes.Santos Martinez:	Now, you said that your children has continued to speak Spanish. Is it important to you?Irma Lopez:	Yes, because if they speak Spanish, there's communication with my parents and otherwise, if they didn't, they will be just losing a lot because there won't be no communication with my parents and I think that's important because I think grandparents aport a lot to family because of their experiences with their children and they know a lot more about life than us as parents. So I think there's a lot of teaching in there.Santos Martinez:	Tell me a little bit and then we'll talk a little bit more about your family. Well, tell me a little bit about the process that you went through of coming here and then coming to school, and some of the things that you experienced. You were 14 when you came and did you go to the public school system?Irma Lopez:	No, because my reason coming here was to work. I know I was at the age that I could go to school, but my whole reason was to help my parents because we were, I would say very, very poor. At an early age, I saw that sometimes there was no food. So my idea was just to help them out. If I was to go to school, I wouldn't be able to do that. Although I wanted to go to school because as I was going to elementary school, I wanted to be a secretary.Santos Martinez:	When you were in Mexico?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, that was what I wanted, but my parents didn't believe in education either. It was work or stay at home and get married, and then have kids.Santos Martinez:	Now, was that true for you as a female, that education was that expected or was that true for the whole family, that your parents did not believe?Irma Lopez:	I think it was for the whole family because they think that since we worked in the fields, they think that to work the fields, you didn't need to know math, which he was wrong. But they didn't think you need to know a lot of stuff that you learned at school since it was just work the land, and girls was to get married, and have kids, and there was no need for school.Santos Martinez:	You were 14 and you came and you started working. Then when did school become important to you? You said that you wanted to go to school initially, but when did you start taking those steps to pursue some schooling?Irma Lopez:	I think I lost interest after I got married, although my interest was quiet down, but never really [00:10:00] lost all the way, but quiet down because I still kept going to night school to get my GED and to learn English. I did that for a couple of years, and then on and off. Then finally, I got my GED back in '96. But I had kids by then and the family part was more important than going to school. Although my husband kept telling me to study something because he knew I liked school. I was always reading books and stories, and maybe they were not important, but in a way, they were helping me because I was learning English, and I was learning to read and he kept telling me to get to school and study something, but that didn't happen until about two years ago that I really wanted to get a job. Since I had no schooling background because I only went to the sixth grade, it was very hard and there's when I decided I needed to go back.Santos Martinez:	Was your husband from the same area in Mexico that you're from?Irma Lopez:	Not from the same area, but very close. We're like maybe 20 minutes apart.Santos Martinez:	So how did you meet?Irma Lopez:	We met here.Santos Martinez:	Really, after both of you had come here and you met here, that's interesting.Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	How did that happen? Tell us about that.Irma Lopez:	Well, they were having some party at Sacred Heart Church, and we were walking out, me and my cousins, we were walking out because we were just getting ready to leave. Then, I noticed this guy walking towards us and I thought he was another guy that I knew from my place. So I approached him and asked him and it turned out he wasn't who I thought he was. Then from then on, he just won't leave me alone. Now, we got marry.Santos Martinez:	So that was a beginning of a beautiful relationship.Irma Lopez:	Yeah. Then, we got married and we've been living together for the past 22 years.Santos Martinez:	Again, are you seems to have taken a really good interest in you and your schooling. Do you want to share something about that? You just said that he encouraged you to go to school.Irma Lopez:	Yeah. He does it because he thinks that if there was something to happen to him, he would want me to be secure, like being able to provide for the kids. As I was, if he was to die or something, I would've had a hard time trying to provide for the kids and he sees education is the only way to get ahead.Santos Martinez:	On that, tell us a little bit about yourself. What do you like to do? Who are you?Irma Lopez:	I'm a very boring person, I think. I like to think a lot. I think things like over and over and over, and I think I do that just to be sure because I'm very perfectionist. So I had to think things over and over in order to meet my own standards.Santos Martinez:	You also said you like to read?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, I like to read.Santos Martinez:	What kinds of stories or what kinds of books do you like to read?Irma Lopez:	Anything. Just anything because I know that even if it's a small article, I know that it has something important in it. That's why it's there.Santos Martinez:	Okay. What about school? You're in school now and tell us a little bit about that.Irma Lopez:	This was my fourth semester, which I don't know, but it seems like it was the hardest one, out of my four-semesters year. I don't know why, maybe because I started working, and before it was just my kids and school, so I had a lot of time to [00:15:00] study. But this semester seems like I didn't really have much free time to study. Another thing is that, like I said before, I only went to school to sixth grade. So a lot of things I just have to learn from the beginning. I have to really go deep to find things out, to learn whatever at that level is being thought. So that makes it a little bit hard too, and then I think my English is not to a point where I can understand everything. There are some words that I still don't understand. So if I'm reading a textbook, sometimes I have to go to the dictionary to try to figure out few words to try to understand the sentence or whatever it's trying to say and that takes some time too.Santos Martinez:	Now, what's your major?Irma Lopez:	Accounting.Santos Martinez:	What do you hope to do with that?Irma Lopez:	Work, and then I have this crazy idea in my head. The other day I was talking to my husband and I was telling him my plans, after we get a little bit older to maybe go back to Mexico and try to do a non-profit organization to help people, because I see that there's a lot of needed things there. For example, on the medical side, there's a lot of people that need medical care and the medical care is just not there and sometimes is there, but the people don't know how to do it and I would like to be able to provide information like, let's say on diabetes, there's just a lot of diabetic people and they just don't know how to take care. They think that because it's incurable, they're just going to die from it. They don't know that it's controllable. That if you keep taking care of yourself and just following directions, you'll be all right and you'll be able to live just a normal life. People don't think that way. Once they're told that they have diabetes is like they're told ""You're going to die,"" and I want to be able to have something to help them. I think accounting would help me out on that because for that, you have to get money to provide for all of that and be able to, how you say this, allocate and seek people to help you out.Santos Martinez:	Do you plan to continue your studies beyond MCC?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	We're talking about your educational dreams and that eventually, you plan to go back to Mexico and try to do some of those things. Do you have a timeline for that? How extensive has been your dream or your planning?Irma Lopez:	I really don't have a timeline. But I think that I have to think of it and start planning on it because of my age right now. I don't have that much time left so whatever I want to do, I would have to start planning on it. But right now, my kids are still young and I think that I would probably leave until my kids have a family of their own. Then they're out of the house and working on their own stuff. That would give me all the freedom to pursue what I want.Santos Martinez:	Have you thought about, your sons were born here and every day their roots go a little deeper into the lifestyle and what it means to be an American. Where would they fit in this dream that you have about going back? [00:20:00] Do you have any idea?Irma Lopez:	By that time, as I think it now, I think that by that time, they'll have their own family. They'll be worried about their own family, about bringing up their own family. I think that I would be able to come here or them to go there, or if there is the possibility of them working with me, that will be great.Santos Martinez:	Let me ask you a little bit about, you were 14 when you came here and you experienced life, because you were working before you started going to school and so forth. What was life like for you as a Mexican living in Central Texas?Irma Lopez:	Hard, especially because of the language, because it was like, you wanted to eat something, it was hard to say it.Santos Martinez:	Communication was an issue for you?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, it was communication, I think. Then when I first got here, I started working as a live-in babysitter. They didn't speak any Spanish and I didn't speak any English at all, so communication was very, very hard. We communicated through books and dictionaries. But I think since my job, it was babysitting, the kids were still not talking, so it was more like playing. I was a child too so it was more like playing with them, how we got along.Santos Martinez:	Did you ever feel discriminated against or did you ever feel rejected because you were different?Irma Lopez:	No, not really. I think most of the white people that I've met here, they've been very nice so far. I feel more discriminated from people of my own kind than different people.Santos Martinez:	If I'm understanding you correctly, you said that there is some differences between Mexicano's here in Central Texas?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. Among ourselves, I think there is.Santos Martinez:	Okay. How have you experienced that?Irma Lopez:	I've noticed that if you're trying to get better or something or you're doing good, people try to pull you down to the same level as they are. I see that as discrimination because I think the sense, we have the same background and stuff, we have to push ourselves up to be at a higher level, not pulling ourselves down. That's how I see it, and I see a lot of it.Santos Martinez:	George Lopez has a comedy routine that speaks about this. He talks about how the Anglo culture is supportive and encouraging of other folks, of other people. But the Mexicano's are not like that. He says we tend to find the negative, we tend to discourage, we tend to put down. It's never like, ""Oh, great, you did great."" It's more like, ""Now you think you're all that?""Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	Is that true? Do we actually do that?Irma Lopez:	Yeah, that's very true. I see that a lot. It's sad, like I said, because instead of pushing us to get better, we're discouraging each other.Santos Martinez:	One of the things that would seem to make a lot of difference in our lives would be to have somebody that's a mentor or somebody that we can look up to. Did you have somebody like that that would encourage you or was it always put downs that we had to deal with?Irma Lopez:	On my Mexican side? Any side?Santos Martinez:	On any side. Yeah.Irma Lopez:	I didn't had, other than my husband before. In the past two years, I've met few people that are very encouraging. I think they're some of the reasons that I am here right now because they [00:25:00] see a side of me that I didn't see. Put it that way. They've been very supportive.Santos Martinez:	You made a lot of accomplishments already. You're a presidential scholar, and that means that you have to have a certain GPA, you have to maintain your grades there are certain expectations. You're volunteering, you're doing some work in the community. Those are some good accomplishments that are going to open some bigger doors for you. How are you gearing yourself to move beyond that? Because if you maintain your grades and so forth, that opens up some really good possibilities for scholarships for you. Are you willing to take those extra steps and move beyond that in spite of the lack of encouragement that has been part of your past?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. I think my motivation are my kids. They're my drive. I think I need to set an example for them. I am the first one in my family to go to college. Even though I'm old, I need to set an example for them and actually, an example that they can see and think that if mom could do this, I can do it because I was born here, and I know the language, and there's just a lot of things that they have that I didn't have. I would say that.Santos Martinez:	Your life has been different. Has it been different than what you imagined it would be?Irma Lopez:	Yes.Santos Martinez:	In what way?Irma Lopez:	Well, as I was growing up, I thought that getting married and having kids, the fairy tale story, happily ever after, and once you get married, it's nothing like that.Santos Martinez:	That's the voice of experience.Irma Lopez:	Yeah, it's ups and downs, and it's nothing like that. There's just a lot to learn in life. I think that's just the beginning.Santos Martinez:	So it has been different?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	You've lived a good full life already. You are 30 something, you said? Thirty something is a good way to look at it, right?Irma Lopez:	Yeah because that could mean 31.Santos Martinez:	You've got some good dreams. You touched a little bit on being a good example for your kids and encouraging them, and you talked about having a dream of going back and making a difference in people's lives. When you look at your life, how would you like to be remembered?Irma Lopez:	I don't really have an idea right now, but I'd just like to be remembered as myself.Santos Martinez:	Okay.Irma Lopez:	Just an ordinary woman.Santos Martinez:	With not a whole lot of regrets?Irma Lopez:	No, actually, I don't have that many.Santos Martinez:	Okay. So at this point, you're just content with getting through school. You do have some dreams. Where do you see yourself in 10 years?Irma Lopez:	Behind a desk, working as an accountant, or planning whatever my plans are going back to Mexico and just getting ahead, looking ahead.Santos Martinez:	It sounds like you have a lot of hard work ahead of you with school, and getting through this and then beyond that, and some of the dreams that you have involve a lot of hard work. So what are you going to do for fun?Irma Lopez:	My fun is reading.Santos Martinez:	Okay.Irma Lopez:	If I turn that into textbooks, that's learning too so that would make it short. I don't really have fun like dancing and drinking, or anything like that. That's not [00:30:00] fun for me. Fun for me, it's giving my time to wherever there is need. That's fun for me.Santos Martinez:	Okay. Is there anything that you want to make sure that you tell people, that you tell me, that you tell the rest of us about yourself, that is so important that you'd like for people to know?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. I think the power of forgiveness, I think that people ought to know that. People ought to know that forgiving gives you freedom. Then if you don't forgive, whatever you're not forgiving is just holding on to you, you're not holding onto it. But that's holding on to you and if you forgive, you're free to move on.Santos Martinez:	How did you learn that?Irma Lopez:	Well, from my own experience, I would say.Santos Martinez:	Okay.Irma Lopez:	Yeah. Also, when I was looking for a job, there was Christian woman, Job Corps, you might heard of.Santos Martinez:	Okay.Irma Lopez:	Yeah. I attended their program and I learned a lot from there, and it was that program that changed my life. Well, I got through that program and I learned forgiveness from them.Santos Martinez:	I guess I'll ask you a little bit about that, because oftentimes, when people hear the idea forgiveness, the thought is about forgiving somebody else. Somebody that hurt me, for example. But how does that apply to your yourself? Is there such a thing as forgiving yourself or perhaps giving yourself permission? Do you ever think along those lines?Irma Lopez:	What do you mean giving permission?Santos Martinez:	Well, sometimes people get stuck in a certain stage in their life, because perhaps they had a failure in their life and they never set themselves free from that. So in your idea of forgiveness, I thought, is there such a thing as forgiving yourself to move on to the next phase of your life, or had you ever thought about that?Irma Lopez:	Maybe not not the way you're saying it. But yes, it's very important to forgive ourselves. It's important to forgive others, but it's important to forgive ourselves too because that holds us too. If we did something, all we need to do is ask for forgiveness because really, we can't go back in time and undo it. Whatever harm we've done, we've done it. So really, just ask for forgiveness from that person and just move on. If they don't forgive you, you just have to forgive yourself.Santos Martinez:	How do you come to realize that perhaps you're stuck? Maybe it's in a pattern or maybe it's in a thought, and really, you're stuck because you haven't moved beyond that to figure out that I had an issue that I need to face and I need to forgive myself, or I'm stuck here because I'm still holding that bitterness against somebody else? How do you recognize it and move beyond that?Irma Lopez:	I recognize my own because I think I was very depressed. As I dig deep into it, I found out that I was just holding a lot of stuff against people that done me wrong. I learned that it does no good to just hold them accountable, but it was harming me more than them, because they were happy and just going around and stuff, and I was depressed because of it. So the only way to get rid of it, it was forgiving. Not forgetting, but forgiving. It was a decision that I had to make. It was not an easy decision because it's not easy to forgive. But whenever I forgave, it was a relief. So it helped me a lot.Santos Martinez:	So Irma, are you [00:35:00] happy now?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	You're happy with your life, with your studies, and way way forward you're going?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	Did you make a good choice when you were 14 to come to this country?Irma Lopez:	I think I did because if I hadn't done it, none of this would've happened. I would probably be down there with a lot of kids.Santos Martinez:	Now, did you come by yourself? You said your parents still lived in Mexico?Irma Lopez:	It was myself, just myself.Santos Martinez:	At 14? You came by yourself?Irma Lopez:	Yeah.Santos Martinez:	Wow. That showed a lot of courage, didn't it, or did it?Irma Lopez:	A lot of hunger.Santos Martinez:	Well, tell us a little bit about that experience and then we'll move beyond that real quick. How did you get here? You were 14 years old, how did you do it?Irma Lopez:	Um...Santos Martinez:	Okay. It was rough, wasn't it? There was a process for you to do that and so you got here and it was hard?Irma Lopez:	Yeah. Well, I came like most of us, illegally. It was not an easy experience, but I think it was worth it because after a month of being here, I started working and so I started sending money. So I think it was worth it.Santos Martinez:	So would you say it's been a good life?Irma Lopez:	Yes, it has.Santos Martinez:	I think we're getting close to where we're going to wrap this up. Anything else you'd like to say, about yourself, or your family, or your plans, or your school?Irma Lopez:	I just would say that, to anybody, just be yourself. Don't be like someone else just because they're fortunate of having things, or an education, or whatever. Just don't try to be like them, but just be yourself. Be original. Try to achieve those things, but on your own way.Santos Martinez:	I see students like you, and Gracie, and Miriam, and others that I see so much in you, so much drive, and so much strength, and potential. I'm just glad to have gotten to know you and knowing that you're making a good contribution to those people that will come after you. So thank you for what you do.Irma Lopez:	You are welcome. It was nice talking to you.Santos Martinez:	It was nice talking to you too.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
MBY007455,"Erika Andiola:	[00:00:00] Okay. My name is Erika Andiola. Today, it's January 29th of 2011, and we're here at Phoenix, Arizona. I'm here with Celso Mireles. So, Celso.Celso Mireles:	My name is Celso Mireles. I'm 23 years old. We're here in the 29th of January, 2011 in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm here speaking with Erika Andiola. She's a very good friend of mine for about two years now.Erika Andiola:	Yes. We pretty much want to talk about how we got to know each other since the beginning. For me, it was very special not only to get to know Celso, but to get to know, I would say about 40 students at Arizona State University who were going through the same thing that I was going through. I don't know if you remember Celso, it was just like I'm the only undocumented student at ASU.Celso Mireles:	I remember that feeling. I guess we can start out by introducing this situation we're in. People call us illegal, undocumented, but in reality, we just don't have the proper documentation. I myself, I've been in this country since I was three years old. I've told this story many times. I basically grew up as an American just like many of us, we're Americans but we don't have that proper documentation. So I was just as surprised as you were, when we were at Arizona State University and all of a sudden our academic scholarships got taken away and we grouped together and found, what was it about? At first it was like 50 students that we met or was was it 40?Erika Andiola:	Yeah. There was about 300 that lost their scholarships just like we did but about 40, 50 of us got together. I remember very well, I don't know if you remember Celso, one of the students in the A, dark one I don't want to say his last name, but I didn't know he was undocumented. I had had him in one of the classes and we came together at a meeting, and just knowing that you are around people who are in your same situation. Even people who have documentation they don't know whether they were there yet, once they find out that we don't have papers, it's like, ""Well, you're an illegal, you don't belong here."" But if they didn't know that, they would treat you just like anybody else.Celso Mireles:	Yeah. I really didn't know anybody else. I feel like during my first three years of college, I was very, I don't know, maybe I guess empathetic to the whole situation. I knew I wasn't documented, I knew that I had to, I was going to work harder because of it. But it wasn't till my scholarship was taken away that I realized this is something that a lot of us are going through and it's just not fair, and we have to work towards a solution. I remember seeing in the WP Carey School of Business in the walls, and it was pictures of star students and there was a girl there. When we got together, I got to know who that girl was. She has her MBA now and she has her Accounting business so I was all like, ""Wow,"" it's definitely possible, but it still doesn't make the situation any more fair. Do you remember Jose Magana or Jose's email. That's how it all started, remember?Erika Andiola:	Yes. It was an email that at the beginning I was like, ""Wait a minute, there's more people at ASU that don't have papers. Now, we can start talking to each other."" It was so special to me. I didn't know, I was like, ""How can I do, so I can drive my other friends, how can I do it so that I can try to get a job."" All these things that I was trying to look for an answer. I was going through a lot of things because you start to realize that you can't get a job. You start to realize that you can drive but it's most likely that you're going to get pulled over and you can go to jail right away. Just seeing that they were 50 other people that were going through the same thing, it was really special to me. Now having you guys is like having another family, and I know that if anything happens to me you'll have my back and it's the same way around.Celso Mireles:	I really like how we evolved as a group. I remember, first, we just started doing community service together because it was a requirement [00:05:00] for our scholarship, and then we just gradually grew into an organization that advocated for student rights. It's something that I feel that I have done, I have been a part of and if I die tomorrow, at least there'll be that memory of me. I'll leave that legacy that, ""Oh, he was part of this."" That's something that's important. I don't know, sometimes I feel I'm weird thinking about death so soon, but it's true, you got to live as if you're going to die tomorrow. You got to be able to say, ""If I die tomorrow, am I satisfied with what I'm leaving behind?"" Not that I'm satisfied, but at least I'll leave something.Erika Andiola:	Definitely. For me, when we started actually organizing ourselves, because at first we were pretty much just a whole bunch of kids that found out that we didn't have papers and that we had other people there for us, but now, when we started organizing ourselves and starting to see that we could actually make a change, that if we spoke up, if we stopped being afraid. I don't know if you remember the first meeting, we had, everybody who was there scared. They were like, what if our PIO comes and gets us right now?Celso Mireles:	I was one of those.Erika Andiola:	Yes, you were so paranoid. You'd always screw by. I remember we had a sign outside of the door that said something like ADA scholars meeting here. People in there were paranoid. Like, ""No. Take that a sign away, what if the police come, they're going to know we're undocumented."" At that time, I remember some people used to call us as the illegals still and it's like, ""No, you are not illegal, there's no such thing as an illegal."" It just seem that we went from that to saying, ""You know what, we're not afraid anymore, and we know that we're there for each other."" If stupid our PIO does show up, it's like, ""Bring it on, we have done nothing wrong, this is our country as well, and if you're going to mess with one of us you're going to mess not only with all of us, but you're going to mess with a whole freaking country.""Celso Mireles:	I think we're not aware we're just as American as anybody else. You Erika, I really commend you because you've really taken that to the next level and you actually got arrested doing that. So I'm like, ""Dang it."" That's something that I don't think I would have the courage to do yet. So I really admire you for that. I don't know if you want to talk about that.Erika Andiola:	It is a really unique experience. I don't talk to you guys so much about it because, I don't know. It's just that at the beginning when I was asked to do this, one of the activists, he's the one that organizes nationally, he came up to me, he's like, ""You want to go to DC to do a civil disobedience action?"" At that time I was like, ""That's just too crazy. I can't risk that. I can't just go to jail and I get deported because my family."" But at that time I was pretty much getting abused, not abused but I was being exploited by my employer. For me it was like, ""Okay, I can't do anything to stop that, I can't do much. My family is going through a lot, we're almost getting kicked out of our apartment."" My family went through a whole raid and because of that, we lost everything. We lost everything and I was like, ""You know what, it doesn't matter. If I go to jail, if I do get deported, I know that it's going to be for my family."" It was really hard. It was the first time. I know there were other students who got arrested in Tucson. They were also undocumented, but they were fine, nothing really happened to them, but they were in deportation proceedings. When I went over there, it was just like, ""Well, I could get deported, but it doesn't matter if I do."" I'm going to I say, ""You know what, at least I fought for this and I'm tired."" It will seem that we're afraid and that's why they do everything to us, because they want to see us afraid. I'm glad I did it. I think a lot of people came out of there saying, ""You know what, we're not afraid anymore. Undocumented and unafraid.Celso Mireles:	We got to change that language. Something that a friend of mine, Dulce told me is that we're really not undocumented, we're documented in a lot of ways. We're in the school system, [00:10:00] I've been in the news for awards for community service. I've met the Mayor because of it. We have a lot of documentation, we just don't have the proper documentation. It's crazy that it's such a heated debate over a piece of paper, but that's humanity for you.Erika Andiola:	Yeah. To me, it's tougher to see that I already went through it, and it's a tough one because of the fact that I can't really work. It's a lot of things that are happening in my life because of this, but that doesn't hurt me as much as like today, I was actually on my brother's wrestling match. Just seeing that, he was too, he's saw Americanized. He's in his wrestling team, and he tells me, ""I don't even want to play soccer,"" because he just has this identity that being Mexican or being Hispanic right now, it means that it's not good, and I can't get that really out of his head, so it's like, ""I don't want to play soccer, I don't want to listen to Mexican music, I want to wrestle, I want to play football because I'm American."" Just seen him go through all of that, and just thinking about the fact that if nothing happens, the dream might does and pass, or if we don't do something about it, he's going to be in my same situation. To me, that's what hurts the most just seeing him and thinking about the fact that he has to go through all things that we have been going through.Celso Mireles:	Yeah. In my sense, it's a little bit painful, because I have two younger brothers, and they were born here, so they're US citizens. But I see them and it's sad because I worked my ass off to graduate from ASU, and I got in, and that'll see that driving them to get that education that I worked so hard for, and it's so much easier for them to get that and they can get so much more out of it. Right now, I feel like and I know you can relate that, but we both graduated from ASU. We were there when President Obama spoke. Me, like five days after I saw President Obama speak at the graduation commencement about how we're going to change the world, I was in Colorado farming alfalfa, and I was like, ""Oh man, what the heck, this is messed up."" But that summer was to life changer for me, Annie.Erika Andiola:	How did you feel that day when Obama was there at that time?Celso Mireles:	I was very resentful. I did not enjoy it at all. For a lot of reasons, for that because I was like, ""Oh great. I graduated,"" and then I was going through the hole and I was about to get married thing, she didn't want to do. Yeah. It's just there was a lot of things for me to think about in that summer, I tried to strain it out, and I think it came back stronger and I said, ""You know what? I'm going to start businesses, I'm going to be an economic stimulus if and if not for this country, at least for my community that needs me here.""Erika Andiola:	For me, l was part of myself because my family was there. I'm the first one to ever graduated from high school. For them, it was like from another world, like Obama is going to be there and everything. I was happy because of that. But at the same time, it feels like bitter and sweet feeling, because I remember Obama when he was giving this speech. I don't know if you remember what he was like. This is the country or the land of opportunity, and whoever wants an education and deserves an education should get an education.Celso Mireles:	Yeah.Erika Andiola:	I can't to sit in there. I am graduating and I dig in my education. But knowing that there's thousands of students that don't get that privilege, that just because of that fact that, they don't have documents and they're coming from a very poor family. What are the chances of them getting money? What are the chances of them getting $20,000 a year to graduate from a university? It just pissed me off so much in knowing that all [00:15:00] of the people who are around you we're going to pretty much go off and just user degree and use what they worked so hard for. I was there also working my ass off. But right now is like, ""What do I do?""Celso Mireles:	I was very mad at that point at that graduation. Even at the graduation, you' would speak to other people in your class and like, ""Oh, what are you doing after graduation? Oh, well, I got this internship. Oh, I will implant to this MBA program. Oh, I'm going to this state."" I got this job offer and I had nothing to show, if you know what I mean. I remember during my last day of class, we were presenting to accompany that we did an internship as a class with, and they really liked my work and they pull me aside and said, ""It's also, we would like your work. You have a position open in our company."" I was like, ""Oh, man,"" I think I reacted very negatively because inside, I was burning, I was like ""Oh."" I told them, ""Thank you so much. That means a lot to me, but this is my situation. Is there any way that maybe we can fix it?"" They're like, ""Oh, if that's the case, then we don't even want to deal with it.""Erika Andiola:	You'll eventually get used to it.Celso Mireles:	I hated it because when it came to my work, to my competency, they really wanted me. But as soon as I heard that, they were like, ""Oh, okay,"" they saw the stereotype, they saw the Mexican, they saw the illegal, and I was like, ""Damn."" But yeah, that's too bad because in the end, they lost a great person, I guess.Erika Andiola:	You get used to it. But it's bad, you surely get used to it but at the same time, it's like sometimes I sit down and I'm like, ""I need to get a job."" Before the end of this month, I'm going to get a job. I sit down, I did my resume, I randomly send it to different places that I know that aren't going to get me because I don't have papers. But it's just like now you're so used to getting rejected. I was like, ""Okay. Well, they're going to reject me once again. It's not a big deal."" It's just also knowing that when I went to work for that organization that pretty much exploited me, knowing that the same organization was fighting for immigrant rights. They're like, ""Oh, you're great organizer, come organized for us,"" and at the same time, there's three months after, they never paid me. This is to me like, ""Am I going to be exploited over and over again until when? When is it going to stop?"" That's why like I told you, if I'm willing, I was willing to go get arrested. I'm willing to do whatever because I'm tired. It doesn't matter what we do, they keep telling us, ""That's not good enough. You're not good enough."" Mine as well, you know what? Just do everything.Celso Mireles:	It's something for me, it's hard because I got married, and then I got divorced. I moved back with my parents and everything. While I was there, my younger sister had a job, and here I am without a job, trying to start a business, but they don't see the fruits of that, and that it's just had, because sometimes your own family brings you down and say, ""Well, what the hell. You have this degree. Your sister doesn't, she has a job,"" I'm like, ""Damn, I'm trying to start a business here,"" and like, ""Well, we need the money now."" It's crazy, I'm barely able to make my own ends meet, much less contribute to my family in any substantial way. But it's hard. That's the main reason that had been stressed lately, because I want to get that company going. I already filed with the Arizona Corporate Commissions. I'm going to get a bank counseling and going to start advertising soon. But still, there's no moral support in the house and then it sucks because they see what I'm doing with the activism for the Arizona Dream, my coalition, all that and they see, ""Oh, what are you doing? That's just a waste of time."" I don't know if you get that.Erika Andiola:	Draws me. Not for my family. My family is very supportive and they know I'm doing everything I can. But at the end getting [00:20:00] more for myself. Just because I'm so passionate about this and I'm so passionate about organizing and fighting for, not only for the dream act but just it has come to a point that now just so upset at all the politics that are going under. I want change in so many ways that I became so passionate that not only can I not get a job, but at the same time is like, how can I balance my life? I graduated in psychology, I had this vision straight up, I had a strait A. When you have a plan, a goal and you have that in your head, like you're in school and you're like, I'm going to graduate. I'm going to give my psychology degree. I want to go to grad school get my counseling, my master's in counseling, and that's it, that's going to be my life, I'll probably get married or whatever happens. But then it's just such a big term for me that all of a sudden is, I graduated in psychology, and all I'm doing is politics, and all I'm doing is dealing with something that has not too much to do with what I wanted to do. So now it's gone to a point in my life that is like, ""Okay. What is it really that I can do?"" Because I can do what I wanted, but I don't have a talent for organizing. I do have a passion for politics, but that wasn't my plan. Now, it has come to a point in my life that I don't even know what is it that I can do, and my family sees that, and they don't judge me, but they do want for me to do something. I don't know. Maybe I judge myself too much, but right now, it's just my mom and my little brother. My family right now, I have my brothers and sisters, but they're married and everything. Right now, they're the only ones that I have to take care of. My mom lost her job because of the raid. But I feel so much responsibility. I feel like everything's on my shoulders. I don't know. When you stop and think about I could've done that. My mom could have been fine right now. I don't have to worry about next month's rent because I don't want them to go through with all this. I don't want them to have to be worried. I don't want my little brother to worry about how we are going to pay the next rent, when he has to worry about school, when he has to worry about being an adolescent. But the other end, for some reason, I feel responsible for it. I should not have been freaking, going to DC to organize. I should've stayed and find a job. Even if I don't organize anymore, I need a job for my family. But I know I have to do it too. So it's just so hard to balance things out and make sure that your family's also that they're safe and that they at least have something to eat and have a place to live. That's the story of my life right now, it's finding that balance. I think a lot of us are going through the same thing. I know I'm not the only one. I've been talking to a couple of the ADAC members and most of the ones that are graduating are going through the same thing.Celso Mireles:	I know, you know, Ileana? That's the reason she's been taken so long.Erika Andiola:	They don't want to graduate.Celso Mireles:	They don't want to. She doesn't want to graduate because she was the same way we were, like what the heck, what's that piece of paper going to give me? It's all about a piece of paper, I think. Our lives are ruled by pieces of paper. Damn, it just hit me.Erika Andiola:	I was talking to actually was it Marco and Danielle? Marco was telling me about he actually got his degree in engineering and I was like so what are you going to do now? He's like, ""I don't know. I'm going take the tests so I can get licensed."" Would you be willing to maybe go to another country to use your degree, because I mean, engineers, they're needed everywhere. But it's the same thing. My mom is here. All he has [00:25:00] is his mom and all that his mom has is him.Celso Mireles:	That's true.Erika Andiola:	Why do we have to be in this spot where we have to choose either? We either have to choose our family or we have to choose to better ourselves. It shouldn't be like that.Celso Mireles:	We should be able to contribute here. I don't think I'm in such a bad situation as you are. I mean, I know you have a lot more pressures. Me, I'm just there, trying to start businesses, trying to employ ADAC members.Erika Andiola:	Try to employ?Celso Mireles:	Yeah.Erika Andiola:	I think it's going to be okay. I do break down sometimes again like that. But at the same time I know that everything will be fine. I tried every single day to do something to change. I know I'm not to just sitting on my ass and not doing anything about it.Celso Mireles:	Exactly.Erika Andiola:	That's what makes me a little more hopeful I guess. I know that I'm not the only one going through this. We're going through it together. Danny and I have been also getting together and just pretty much doing the same, talking about what can we do because he actually finished a year of law school and now he's like it sucks because all his friends are going to graduate next year at a law school and he couldn't. You don't think about it but you never ask them, but once they come and tell you, I feel like crap because I want to go to my graduation, to my friends' graduation, and I should have been there graduating and I can't. He's going through the exact same thing. He's 25 and he's like how can you be like 25-year-old living still with your parents? The culture here in the United States is usually you're out of the house when you go to college. For us dreamers, it is like you're freaking 30 years to live with your parents.Celso Mireles:	It sucks. I really like the way I started 2011. I started giving the guitar classes and then starting to start that computer repair business. I don't know. I think 2011 is going to be a good year. We've been meeting together for Danny and everything and just change that mindset that we're stuck here. No, it's just one more rock we have to jump over. But in reality we are going to fight for our dreams.Erika Andiola:	That's my dream. I want to see all of us grow. I know there's millions, maybe not millions, but there's thousands of students out there just like us that don't even know that there's support and there's people there for them. Regardless of anything that happens, either family gets pulled over or they get pulled over, we can be there for them. For me, that's my dream for not only ADAC in Arizona, but for every single state to start organizing their undocumented students and for them to get that power and say we're also undocumented and we are unafraid. Like you said, we can't just stop there and cry about our obstacles. I do that a lot, but the next day I get up and we have to keep going and maybe we don't have to do it our own way. Maybe we can be like everybody else. We can be like our friends. Maybe we have to try a little harder like we've always done, but it can be done. I know that I have the talent to be able to grow ADAC. We have to make an ADAC in every single high school they will do it and in college.Celso Mireles:	That's a cool vision right there.Erika Andiola:	It's my dream and I think we can definitely do it and make something happen. We have to change a lot of things, we have to change a lot of minds, a lot of hearts, and make them realize that we're not criminals, we're not illegals, we're dreamers.Celso Mireles:	I think [inaudible 00:29:54] , but yeah, I don't know. [00:30:00] What else do you want to talk about?Erika Andiola:	I don't know. I think we talked a lot about it.Celso Mireles:	Yeah. You know what really sucks? When you fall in love with another undocumented.Erika Andiola:	Yeah, everybody wants us to marry a citizen, like that's going to work.Celso Mireles:	I know. Man, that's crazy. A lot of couples in ADAC.Erika Andiola:	Yes. I don't know. I guess it's just that when you go through all that stuff, you find somebody else who's going through the same thing, you just fall into it because I don't know, like to me, I can't just get married and get papers because of the whole situation. Not everybody can have this understanding that people have, like, why don't we just go marry a citizen? But to me, it's like even if I could, even if I could just go get married and get papers, why would I do that? We all think of marriage, maybe not all of us. But a lot of us see marriage as something that you do when you do fall in love with somebody, and for you to just go get married just for papers, to me, it's like you're selling your soul. I don't know. It just doesn't seem right.Celso Mireles:	Yeah, I know.Erika Andiola:	You know how Laurita that keeps telling us, don't fall in love with a dreamer. Don't go get married with an undocumented person. Go find a citizen. It's like, no, well, why do I have to change my whole life, my whole future just because I want to get accepted so bad that I'm willing to do that? There's so many ways that we can actually try to make them understand that they we're here just to find an opportunity.Celso Mireles:	Yeah.Erika Andiola:	Hey, we're going through the same thing. It's most likely we're going to connect a lot more. I know you know what I'm talking about.Celso Mireles:	I know what you're talking about. Yeah. I don't think a lot of people know. They used to know that I was married. I tried it, but it didn't work for either of us, and now I'm single again.Erika Andiola:	It's the same thing. Like I was saying, I went through that. I was offered by my boyfriend back in the day, like I can just marry you right now and you'll be fine because he knew that I was going to ASU and every single day I would come like, ""Hey, what am I going to do after ASU?"" He was like, ""Well, we can just get married and you'll be fine."" But even though we did, once I was there, I was like, ""No, I can't do this. I can't just try to get papers just by marrying you. I can do it,"" and I didn't do it. I have to do it because I'm going to fight for it because I know that I'm going to deserve it, not just because I'm getting married. Even though he was everything for me back then, it didn't work out. He couldn't, but he would have gotten me papers, I would feel like I will owe him my life.Celso Mireles:	I think that's how I felt too though. I was like, damn, this relationship is headed down the drain. Do I really want to do this? I could have been a legal resident, but it's just not right, knowing that the relationship was going nowhere. Like we say in Spanish, dicho y hecho, that happened. It fell apart and here I am again.Erika Andiola:	I don't know. There's always shortcuts and ways to do things the wrong way, but it's like when you want money and you can just go steal something, you're going to get that money if you steal it. But if you want something so bad and you know you can work for it, then you don't have to go in and do that, and if you do get married and you fall in love with somebody that is a citizen or that can get you papers, ""hey, that's good for you."" But if you're just going to go to cheat, I don't know, it's not what I'm all about. But I respect people. I don't know.Celso Mireles:	Maybe we're a little conservative on that side. Crazy.Erika Andiola:	But I do. I love my dreamer. I don't care.Celso Mireles:	[00:35:00] I love mine too. You were there and she's teaching me, well, I'm learning how to dance with her. I really suck at dancing. I do.Erika Andiola:	No comments.Celso Mireles:	See? It's true.Erika Andiola:	I'm just kidding.Celso Mireles:	But it's all good. I'll learn to dance.Erika Andiola:	Well, me and Daher are pretty much screwed because he's on the other side of the country. Like I told you, it's just that we're going through all the same things I did meet him in New York, and I'm freaking in Arizona. We're literally, I don't know how many miles apart.Celso Mireles:	A couple of hundred miles.Erika Andiola:	But just the connection of whenever something happens to me, like yesterday, we had two of our people pulled over.Celso Mireles:	Two? Who was the other one?Erika Andiola:	Two. We get two people pulled over in the same day. They both called me, Erika, I'm getting pulled over in LA, they text me, and I'm like, what the hell do I do? Just for me to be able to call him and tell him when I'm stressed out about that, I don't think anybody else would understand as much as we understand each other.Celso Mireles:	Yeah.Erika Andiola:	Yesterday, he was in [inaudible 00:36:19] and also like, I'm there in the morning. What do I do? What if he gets deported right now? They'll actually put him in jail, and he calls me right after and he's like, Erika, ""I'm okay. I'm out. But they took my fingerprints. They did all this to me."" He's crying. You know how sensitive he is. I'm like, why would they do this? Why are you going to scare a 20-year-old? He's just getting out of school, he's going home, and again, he gets pulled over out of nothing. Then I'm there at night, getting ready to go dancing with you guys, then I get another call, ""Erika, this girl, I don't want to say her name, but she just got pulled over"" and I'm like, dude, now what do I do?Celso Mireles:	This is about the weekend because I heard that Sheriff Joe is doing one of his raids.Erika Andiola:	He's doing raids. So I don't know if it was because of the raids, but I know that in, I think every two months, I get about 3-4 calls from people, I just got pulled over. To me, it's like I should be getting used to it, or I should be getting a little more practice in what to do, but I freak out. I'm like, okay, who do I tell? Who do I call? I open Gchat, and the first person I see on Gchat, I'm like, ""Hey, help me out.""Celso Mireles:	So that's fine.Erika Andiola:	X person just got pulled over. Who can we call? Where is his family? I don't know. Why does it have to be like that? I don't know. But hey, I guess it's something that we have to learn how to do and hopefully we can get a plan so that whoever gets pulled over from ADAC will know what to do, and even with their family.Celso Mireles:	I'm working on the technology aspect of that, I'll get a database going.Erika Andiola:	I don't know if you remember when we went camping, that three of my members got pulled over?Celso Mireles:	Yeah. I was in Colorado, working.Erika Andiola:	That was the first time for me. I was like, ""Wow, this is a reality check."" We're not anywhere, we can't even go freaking camping to Payson because we get three of our friends in deportation proceedings. You know how special they are to us.Celso Mireles:	Yes.Erika Andiola:	For me to know that one of them is like, I don't know. It just doesn't make sense.Celso Mireles:	It's just not fair.Erika Andiola:	But I think they're going to be okay. They're great people and they're very smart, so I think that they can do whatever it takes to be able to stay here and keep being with us and keep being with their family. But we'll see.Celso Mireles:	I guess the fight continues.Erika Andiola:	Trust me, this is going to take years. Arizona is not going to change within the next, I would say... I don't know. California took about 10 years to be able to change.  It took them 10 years to be able to change everything that they were going through. I don't know how much we can really take here in Arizona, [00:40:00] but we're going to have to go through this for a long time.Celso Mireles:	Yeah.Erika Andiola:	I could easily move to New York, but I don't know if I want to do that.Celso Mireles:	That's how I feel. I grew up in Arizona. I'll miss the soleros if I leave.Erika Andiola:	You'll miss the cactuses.Celso Mireles:	The cacti.Erika Andiola:	The cacti?Celso Mireles:	Yes, cacti because it's plural.Erika Andiola:	Excuse me. But thank you, Celso.Celso Mireles:	No problem. Thank you for sharing.Erika Andiola:	I'm sorry I'm a cry baby.Celso Mireles:	It's okay. I'm used to it.Erika Andiola:	Shut up.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
MBY007671,"BARBARA ASHUD:	[00:00:00] My name is Barbra Ashud. I'm 69 years old. Today is April the 2nd, 2011. We're in Long Beach, California and I'm a friend of Bertha.Bertha O'Cal:	My name is Bertha O'Cal. I am 28  years old. Today is April 2nd, 2011. We're in Long Beach, California and Barbra is a friend of mine.FEMALE_1:	So Bertha, what made you decide to come record a conversation today?Bertha O'Cal:	Every life has a story to tell, and I am so blessed that I've had so many experiences  in my life. This is a wonderful opportunity to be able to not only share with the world but be able to give something back to my brothers and sisters and know that everything is possible.FEMALE_1:	Okay. So where are you from?Bertha O'Cal:	I was originally born in Honduras, Central America. I was actually born December 28, 1981. My mom always says it's the day of the innocent.FEMALE_1:	What does that mean?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, it's the day of a saint. I thought, well, wow, I have a lot of pressure to be really good. But I moved out to the United States with my entire family. We migrated November 21st, 1989. Since then, I've never looked back and just continue to move forward.FEMALE_1:	So what do you remember about where you were born?Bertha O'Cal:	I appreciate the everyday struggles that we had in Honduras because they were not the same. We take things for granted here in the US sometimes. It was as small as, maybe not having warm water to take a shower or not having a washer and dryer and as kids, we didn't really have toys. My parents couldn't afford to buy toys. So we used our imagination quite a bit. Sometimes when I see little kids and they have all these little toys and I'm thinking, wow, if you could just play make-belief and how fun that would be. That you can take a box and turn it into like a house or take the leaves from a plant and use that and cut into a little circle and that's a little tortilla because you're playing house. So there's little things like that that I appreciate now as an adult and even though we did struggle, I think that it's allowed me to become the woman that I am now.FEMALE_1:	What do you know about how your family got from Honduras to the United States?Bertha O'Cal:	It's always, the US always represented for my family a fresh new start, an opportunity to give back. They always wanted to give us more and they wanted us to be happy and safe and the US represented that for them. A long time ago my grandmother migrated to the US. She was an illegal, undocumented immigrant, better said, sorry, but she struggled out here and eventually, she worked really hard to gain her citizenship and through her citizenship, she requested us to come out to the US. My dad wouldn't have it any other way unless we all came as a family. So we all decided that it was the right thing to do. I was a little scared. We didn't know any English and so that was in itself a big elephant because we had to learn how to speak English and get around. California is so big. Before we walked everywhere and here we had to learn how to take the bus and learn how to communicate so we can get around. So that was also an experience in its own.FEMALE_1:	How old were you then?Bertha O'Cal:	I came to the US in 89, so I was eight years old and my birthday's on the 28 of December, so I was eight going on nine years old.FEMALE_1:	And Bertha, what kind of kid were you at eight years old?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow. Well, I was always the one that got in trouble. I had a beautiful life in Honduras despite the struggles. Like I said, I used my imagination a lot, so we played pretend, make-belief. I was either stewardess or a banker. I was a doctor. I was a teacher, and I had friends next door. I think I was just a little kid that always had that imagination and was determined that if it was raining, I was still going to have a good day and we were going to remain positive and have a good time. But I did get into a lot of trouble because of that because I [00:05:00] always found a way to keep things interesting at home. But my mom knew that I was a handful and she was very patient with me. I think that she gave me the ability to just explore and be curious and ask questions. Again, that has, I think, allowed me to be who I am now. I think that I find that same curiosity now. I like to explore and I'm always hungry, and I love what I do now because of that same reason.FEMALE_1:	What are you doing now?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, I am personally a business owner. I own 21 Liberty Tax locations within California area. But I think what I love the most is not so much the business, but what I get to do with the business. I love that the business has become a vehicle where now I can give back to the community in many ways. Either through educational courses or to be able to provide jobs for families that maybe had the same struggle that I did growing up. An opportunity for young ones that maybe are in high school, but they don't think they have the ability to go to college. That they can learn a profession and work in an office environment and take certain courses through our business that can allow them to get college credits. Now, they are attaining something they ever thought it was possible. I love being able to provide that. But I think that because we've created an education initiative as part of our business, we've been able to move strides and we've been able to work with different organizations that have been giving us the opportunity to provide that to the community in addition to providing a service.FEMALE_1:	Let's go back to when you were eight. Do you remember the first day you were in the United States?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow, yes. I think we were the best-dressed kids in the airport that day. My mom wanted us to wear our best dress, our shoes shine, our hair was done. I was scared, I'd never been on an airplane before. I remember that as part of the reading, dad, wanted us to read a learning comprehension book in English, and I was going through and I'm like, what is this? I don't understand. But I did manage to learn how to count one through 10 in English and learn how to write it in that time that it took us to get to the United States. When we first set foot at the airport, it was just overwhelming because the airport seemed so huge. Everyone was speaking English and we never had even been in a car before. Just getting from the airport to the house that we were going to reside for a few months, the lights and the cars, the freeways, everything was new, and so it was exciting, a little daunting, but exciting at the same time.FEMALE_1:	Did you start school right away?Bertha O'Cal:	I did. In fact, I was placed in the class that it was just taught in English. I know now that that was a good thing because that allowed me to quickly learn English. I remember that for the first three months, I was provided a tutor that would pull me away during recess and I would sit down with him and we would just learn how to speak English. He would teach me how to pronounce. I knew that that was the motivation for me right away because all my friends were out there playing, recess time, and I wanted to go play too. But that pushed me to learn English rather quickly because it gave me that motivation that if I can learn this, I can go play. I don't have to be here for a few months. But sure enough, I learned enough to get by and in three months, I was speaking English, doing my homework, and working just as hard in school.FEMALE_1:	Was that hard?Bertha O'Cal:	I think it wasn't so much speaking English, but the comprehending part of it. That was what took a little longer to get the hang of it, but it did happen still rather quickly in three months. After that, oh, it was a breeze.FEMALE_1:	Do you remember missing Honduras?Bertha O'Cal:	I do. From time to time, I always go back and think about what life was like in Honduras. But I love my life now, I really do. I think that now what [00:10:00] I get to do is far more rewarding. I don't know what my life would've been like in Honduras, but I'm thankful that my parents, despite the struggles that we had here in the US, that I had the opportunity to meet people, to have mentors that got me to where I'm at now.FEMALE_1:	What do you think it was like for your parents to bring a family over?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, they worked so hard. In Honduras, they didn't work as much, but coming to the US, for them now it turned into they had to sustain a house for us and pay the bills. So for them it was quite a challenge. We didn't really get to see them that much actually. I think that my older sister and I became the parents of the house. We had younger siblings and it was up to us to not only do our homework, but to help them with their homework, to make sure they were going to class, the house was clean, that there was food in the house, and to cook. I know that they're grateful for it, but they always thought, ""If we can show them that they can have a modest job and they can work, they can grow up and do the same thing."" They never believed in going to school. My mom, I think, only completed the equivalent of sixth grade and my dad almost through the equivalent of maybe tenth grade. So for them, school wasn't as important as being able to work to provide a decent living for their family, and they wanted us to grow up to be the same way. But I think I've always had different goals in mind, different ambitions, and I think I have overcome that despite that they still feel the same way. My goal has been, from the very beginning, that not only was I going to do and live a different life, not that there was anything wrong with what my parents were doing, but I wanted to do more. I also wanted to be an example for my little brothers and sisters, that they could also have that too. I'm actually very excited because one of my brothers is going to be graduating from high school, and he's going to be going to college. He's already received his acceptance letters and now, he's deciding what college to go to. That is so exciting for me because I know that I've done a few things that have been right along the way.FEMALE_1:	Was it hard for you as a child yourself to take care for your siblings?Bertha O'Cal:	It was very difficult because you're not so much a sister anymore, you're almost looked at as the mom. My parents didn't know how to read and write in English, so we made a lot of the phone calls for them, we translated everything, we filled out a lot of the paperwork, rental applications. So we took on a lot of the parent responsibilities at home. So I think I did grow up rather quickly in that sense. I think that it was a little bit difficult, but I think we still managed to have a very close relationship as brothers and sisters. Even up until now as we are growing up, we're so close to each other and we're there and supporting each other every step of the way.FEMALE_1:	I want to go back just a little bit to your parents. What's one your favorite memories of your mother?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, my mom used to play with me quite a bit in Honduras. It wasn't so much possible when we came to the US because she was working so much. But one of the best memories I have is my mom, we didn't have a lot of toys, we would take leaves from the trees and we cut them up into little tortillas and then we use some of the dirt and we put some water and we made mud, and then she would pretend like she was having dinner and she was enjoying the food that I was making for her. So I guess there was a lot of just playtime with mom. That's what I loved. With dad, he never really read too much to me, but he did manage to always bring books or have books in the house, and some of them were even religious books. So I love that my dad was able to give us books in that sense because it gave me an escape. I got to read about other worlds and other topics and that was always fun and interesting. We did read quite a bit growing up, even though it's ironic because school was never really that important to my parents.FEMALE_1:	Why do you think that was?Bertha O'Cal:	I think that maybe they were put in that same position, where they had to grow very [00:15:00] quickly. In Honduras, at 12-years-old, especially my dad, if you were the man and the oldest child, you were required to work. School you had to pay for, you couldn't pay for school, you couldn't pay for books. So the next thing that you had to do was just go out there and make a living and sustain the family until you're able to sustain your own family. So that is why I think that they feel it was more important than having to go to school.FEMALE_1:	I'd like to switch gears a little more. Again, what would you say has been one of the happiest moments of your life?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow, there's so many happy moments. I guess there's a few and for me, one of the things I've been able to do is really start my business. I think that that has been a huge accomplishment for me. It was a dream, almost, to be able to put a business together in a very short period of time and to be able to employ people in the community through my business, and then step away from the business to be able to get back into the community. So that to me was a huge accomplishment. Maybe another one that's more personal to that is also, I did a marathon in 2004 and that was huge for me too. I think I felt that once I did that, I could do anything, and that everything was possible. I think soon after that, in 2005, is actually when I started my business.FEMALE_1:	What made you decide to start your business?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, it was the right time. I wanted the business to provide, also an opportunity to keep my mom employed, my dad employed, because the economy wasn't doing so well. My dad's currently working there, my mom, my brothers, so I think what it did for me was an opportunity to provide for my family and an opportunity to be able to give back to the community. Those have been always the two most important things, to make a difference. Because I knew how a difference it made in my life when people came into it and they influenced me in a positive way that I thought, well, I need to do the same thing. I need to put myself in a position where I can give back. The business was a good opportunity to be able to get into it and I knew if I work really hard, I can have that and I have. It's taken me about six years and it's been a lot of work but I'm here, and it's so rewarding. I have a good time every day because I feel like I'm making that difference and I'm reaching that goal that I always had right after high school.FEMALE_1:	Do people ever ask you if you think you're too young to have so much responsibility?Bertha O'Cal:	I had now welcome the responsibility. I think, it's important to have those responsibilities. If I didn't take on those responsibilities, I think that not only would my life been different, but also the lives of the people that are in my life. Through those responsibilities they've been able to have their own goals accomplish. I think that for me, I don't regret any of it. Its been wonderful and I loved the struggles because again, it made me who I am. It's shaped the woman that I've always thought I'd wanted to be, I guess.FEMALE_1:	So who is that woman? What woman are you now?Bertha O'Cal:	I'm a woman that has a lot of courage. I'm determined, I'm forever optimistic about life and what I can do with my life. I am supportive, but I also feel that I am a leader. That I feel that, through my way of being, I'm making a difference in the lives of other people and I will continue to do so.FEMALE_1:	So Bertha, who would you say has been the most significant or influential person in your life?Bertha O'Cal:	[00:20:00] There's a lot of people, but I think my husband has and continues to be the most important person in my life that he has really taught me so much. I met him at such a young age and I think that before he became my husband, he was a brother, a mentor, a friend, and I was fortunate enough to marry him and this is in 2008.FEMALE_1:	What is his name?Bertha O'Cal:	His name is Douglas.FEMALE_1:	How did you and Douglas meet?Bertha O'Cal:	We, actually, me through the first office job I had. This was in, 1997 is when I met Doug. For a long time I was working doing different things, newspaper outs, and restaurants and I knew I didn't want to do that. I wanted something different and I went to the Career Center in the high school I was in, and I saw a want ad for a telemarketing position to be filled at an insurance agency. I didn't even know what telemarketing was. I didn't even know any of that. But I only knew that I did not want to work at a restaurant anymore, not that there's anything wrong with that but I wanted something different. So I decided to go in and apply and I took on the position as a telemarketer, and I always thought if I'm going to do something just do a good job at it. I think that that's how everything started for me. Being involved in that position, I met people. That time I met Doug, and he's older than I am, so he was always open to teach me what he knew. He always said, if you learn something, you've got to teach it and I've never forgotten that. Ever since then, he's been a great role model. He always pushes me to work hard and never lets me quit. I admire him for that because, I haven't hit on my side. We've been able together to accomplish things and been able to provide for my family, and been able to provide for the people that are part of our organization.FEMALE_1:	Do you remember your first impressions of him?Bertha O'Cal:	Yes. I thought he was a little cocky. He's definitely also very charming. He was a gentleman. He had and he has a great personality and we loved to socialized, we loved to dance so we're big dancers. We love our life and every day we are thankful for having each other in our lives and blessed that we have what we have and that we can provide for our family and that's very important to us.FEMALE_1:	So Bertha, you have already accomplished so much, what are your hopes for the future?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, through the business as I mentioned, we started an education initiative called Una Familia Sin Fronteras, a family without boundaries. This initiative has grown also quite a bit in the last couple of years, to the point that this initiative has now turned into a non-profit foundation. So our goal is to continue to be a part of this foundation, and to continue to provide resources for our community. Through the business we're able to provide a service, but at the same time, were able through the foundation, thanks to the business, able to provide not only education, but an opportunity, a different way of life. People that never thought that they can go to college can now have the ability to go to college. They can work in an office environment, they don't have to work somewhere else. They can come in, we we teach them how to use the computer, we teach them how to get accredited, to be able to continue on in the tax industry and get certified to do taxes. So for me I want to see that goal. I want to have more people be a part of it and to participate. I want that to be spread out. We do have 21 locations, and in every location that we open, we want to make sure that that community knows that we're there. How do we do that? It's really just by getting out there and talking to them and what's important to them. A lot of them really want to work hard and they want to do better. We've been blessed through every year we grow and we bring them into our office. This year we took on 500 employees [00:25:00] and a lot of them were people from the community that we gave them the resources to learn how to get certified for that profession, and to be able to come into an office and they can learn how to use computers and then now, be able to teach people what they know. Then, they can then offer the same thing to other people. So I love that part of it a lot.FEMALE_1:	What about personally, what are some goals outside of the business that you have for your future?Bertha O'Cal:	I want to have a family. I think that that's definitely next in line. I think that personally, I would love to have little kids running around the house. We already started, we have a dog, and he's wonderful. I didn't really have dogs growing up as pets. So that was cool to have my very first pet. Personally, I think that's the next biggest thing in my list and I want to be able to support my brother as he's going into college this semester, and getting him set up for it, and just being there in his side, it's important to me.FEMALE_1:	Of all of the people whose lives you have touched, who's touched you the most?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow. There's been different people. Sometimes it's as simple as a customer that I may be talking to from work, or someone that's gone through the foundation and to hear from them that, ""Wow, thank you for giving me this opportunity."" You hear their struggles and I can relate to their struggles. When I hear their story and now what they have accomplish, it makes me feel good like, ""I'm glad that you fought for that because I know how rewarding it is to have it once you fought for it"". To me that's always touched me and continues to touch me every single day. I think as I run into different people with different backgrounds, but the opportunity that they had and how rewarding they feel and happy and excited that now they can go on and do something bigger and better. That's always gives me the warm fuzzes.FEMALE_1:	Was there ever a time when you felt like you had hit a wall either with the business, or with learning to be in a new country as so young in age?Bertha O'Cal:	Absolutely. It was always difficult. My parents always again, believe that you should work and help sustain the family. So I started out when I was 12, working and did a lot of things. I think I haven't stopped working since then. I think now I'm learning how to enjoy life a little bit more and find things that are rewarding. But I did start at a young age and I didn't always like to do that because I felt like sometimes I'd rather go do what my friends were doing because that was much more fun. But I knew that, that was a responsibility that I had to take on. So sometimes the wall was just not being able to go out and maybe have the same lifestyle that some of my other friends did, and maybe not wanting to work at such an early age, but knowing that ultimately I was helping my mom and my dad out. So that was there that was a struggle, I guess. Yeah.FEMALE_1:	Do you remember that first job?Bertha O'Cal:	Yes. It was a coupon distribution. So we always had to get up early in the morning and distribute tons of coupons. It was different, but it was nice because I think that it made my parents very happy to do all of that.FEMALE_1:	So Bertha, how did your family think of you?Bertha O'Cal:	Well my family, they still depend on me. I think that despite the fact that they lived out here for such a long time, they still struggle with English. They don't [00:30:00] quite know how to read and write. So I'm still very much a part of what they do. But I think that what I've been able to do along the years is been able to, not just do it for them, but teach them how to do it. So for example, one of the things I was able to teach my dad was how to do bill pay on the computer. That for me was such an accomplishment because dad would always go to a place and pay the bills. But now that I was able to teach him, I got him a computer. I said, ""Dad, I'm going to do something much bigger than just do this for you."" So we got him a computer. We guide him in email address. We have user ID. So I think that's been funny and it feels good. I know that he feels good because he feels like he's accomplishing something, is he can now go on his computer and he can pay all his bills and he communicates via email with me now. So that's nice because I can feel like a little bit at a time, I can teach little things like that to my family and that they can start to assimilate a little bit more into our culture, even though that their beliefs are still very old. But I think that they're starting to become a little bit more open-minded about things and they want to learn, and they're going to get there one day. Slowly, but surely, they'll get there.FEMALE_1:	When you say assimilate, what do you mean with regard to your parent?Bertha O'Cal:	Well, I guess, what I want to say is I want them to know that they can have more. I want them to not necessarily be stuck on their ways. I want him to see that, ""Dad, look, if I go to school, I can have this. Look where I'm at now, Dad. I have a business and look what I can do. If you support my little sister and now that she will have the opportunity pretty soon to go to college. If you support her, she can have that too. What you wanted, dad, for us when we were in Honduras, we can have that. You did a huge sacrifice. You made a huge sacrifice by bringing the entire family here. So now, give us the opportunity to really just to reach for that."" I think that I am slowly showing them that that's possible. When I know that they see it, then they believe it, and that I want them to be able to see that we can have the things that they hope for us when we were in Honduras.BARBARA ASHUD:	Bertha, from what I know of you and these stores and the business that you have, you focused on Latino communities or the communities where there are low-income families or small businesses. You've made it your work to help them, not just do their taxes, but also, build a better life for themselves with this opportunity of maybe I choose not to assimilate. Maybe I'm happy living in Huntington Park and I don't want to leave the community. But you've shown them a way to be very successful and provide for their families. I'd like you to talk a little bit about that.Bertha O'Cal:	Well it starts off with a lot of them don't realize that there are things that they can do here in the US. For example, they can come to the US and they can obtain certain identification that will give them the opportunity to get a checking account to apply for a loan. So we teach them those opportunities. Not only do we shown them that's possible, but we spent time with them. We guide them through the entire process from beginning to end. So now once they have this tax ID, they can go in, do their taxes. Some of them can actually get money back. But then we also say, ""Great. Now that you have this ID, you can now get that checking account. So now that you have the checking account, let's show you how to use that checking account."" So we show them how to use a checking account and use it responsibly. So we teach them fiscal responsibility and financial responsibilities. So we show them the opportunity there. Then they say, ""Well I want to do what you do."" So that is another opportunity that we have for them. They're no longer the customer on the other end. They can be the person who's providing that service. So we give them the opportunity for free to be able to learn how to do that. They can do it in a very short period of time. That's the nice part about it.BARBARA ASHUD:	I think what has been so wonderful and inspiring [00:35:00] of what I know of you, that many families that come to the United States and they work very, very hard. some working in kitchens, some making beds, but you've shown them they can do so much more. That whether they be a translator, giving them enough English so they could go to work for in Edison and translate in customer service. So I'm really thinking of, not only of those individuals, but also I know of you that you see youngsters, teenagers in the community that have potential and maybe they're on the wrong path. I've seen some of the students that you have where you've made them trainers.Bertha O'Cal:	Absolutely. For them, I think that that's a huge accomplishment because, like I said, maybe because they may have strayed away and they're not in a good path, they never thought that they would have that kind of opportunity. So for them to be able to do that, it boosts their self esteem, their confidence. Because for me, I think that that's just the starting point for them. That's just the beginning. We ultimately want them to come through us, but we want them to leave because this is just your starting point. Now, you have the wings, go fly. Go do something else. So they'll go out now and can take what little they learn and even for them a lot. But they take what they learn and maybe some of them will continue, and some have, continue on to the four-year and gone past their bachelor degree or their master degree. Some have gone to get other jobs where they can now be in a position where they're making a difference, not only for themselves, but for their family and also the people that they're providing that service. So they're now doing that as well.BARBARA ASHUD:	How many certified public accountants have you helped establish their own business?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow. It's probably been in the hundreds. I would say, over 300. A lot of them had not just gone through our own process, but not only gotten their own business, but they've also gone to school. So some of them are still in school in hopes that they're going to get that degree to do something different, whether it's the PR industry, marketing, or sales, or whatnot. One of them, he wants to work with the mayor because he feels that he wants to make a difference, and he wants to stay in his community. He's not trying to leave. I think that that's the coolest part because we work with them in the community. Now that they see what's possible, they want to stay in the community to do the same thing.BARBARA ASHUD:	So you're building community?Bertha O'Cal:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	Bertha, I'd like to ask you another question. So you're planning to have children and they will have children.Bertha O'Cal:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	What advice would you want those great grandchildren of yours to hear from you that maybe they couldn't hear from someone else?Bertha O'Cal:	Wow. To always do the right thing because I think in doing the right thing, it really does protect you. It's a rewarding feeling and let people know that they matter. Everyone wants to feel that they're wanted and they can make a difference. So in essence, I guess, again, is to just be the best human being that you could possibly be. In doing the right thing, you're going to make a difference. So that would be my advice to them, to just do the right thing and be the best possible human being that they can be. In doing so, they're going to make a difference in the world.FEMALE_1:	One one last question for me. What message would you want to give to 50 year old Bertha hearing this message one day?Bertha O'Cal:	What message? ""Bertha, you stuck your guns. You did it, and what a life it's been. Just continue to make a difference and continue to, not only teach what you learned, but also, to live what you know. That's important. You can't teach without really living what you learn, and that's important."" So I would tell myself that at 50 years old, ""You did it, Bertha. Good job.""FEMALE_1:	So is there anything else you want [00:40:00] to say, Bertha?Bertha O'Cal:	I think this has been a great opportunity, and I'mso blessed to have that. Moving forward, I don't plan to stop. I'm going keep going.FEMALE_1:	Well, thank you so much.Bertha O'Cal:	Thank you.",1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
MBY007685,"Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	[00:00:00] Remember, you're first.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah, I have to introduce myself. My name is Pedro Eduardo Oribe and I am 26, I was born December 29th, 1984. I'm in Los Angeles, California at the California African American Museum with Jeffrey, my mentor, and I'm going to ask him to introduce himself.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I am Jeffrey Anderson Gunter, I have an age range at the moment because in this business you give your age, they don't give you the work you deserve. So at the moment, I am between 55 and 65, closer to the ladder. This April fourth, we're in Los Angeles at the California African American Museum, and I'm with my mentee Pedro Eduardo Oribe from Panama. So what would you want to know?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Everything.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Oh, come on man.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's the last conversation, I got to know everything.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	All right. You don't know anything, we've just been dealing teacher-student, you have no idea who you befriended.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You've been giving me information of the qualitative, instrumental purposes. I haven't really known too much of your biography.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Right.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	But everything that you have taught me has helped me greatly and I thank you.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You're most welcome.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Deeply.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You're most welcome, and when we come back, we'll do it again.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes, cheers to that. This is a question that I am sure everyone in the future will like to know, what are the most important lessons that you've learned in life?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Firstly, to love yourself and be true to yourself, and be honest with yourself. Because I think if you have those three in line, then everybody else who comes into your sphere will benefit, and you then will pass that on. Because, we're in a changing world and we spend so much time on the unimportant things, and those things are the things I just mentioned, I think are the basics, the foundation, from which to grow and to make one better. So if we start there with that foundation, I think everything else will happen in its due time because we're able to communicate that with each other. They had a thing on TV the other day about the happiest place in the world, I don't know if you saw that, but I saw that, and they asked the question, well, what makes this the happiest place in the world? The woman said, ""Because we care about each other, we love each other, we communicate with each other, we respect each other."" Nobody mentioned money and things.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's not the dimension of place.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. That's where I start.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Home is where the heart is.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	It has to be, that agape love is what our good Lord did.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Love for all.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	He had agape love, that's why he looked at Mary Magdalene and said, ''I don't care what she did, if she needs me right now, she's calling for me, so I'm going to answer her call.'' He didn't get on well, she's at this she is at that, Yellowstone her.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Her judgment.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Right. So that's why I get up every morning and try to be the kind of person my dog thinks I am. If I can accomplish that every day, I am good, because for them I am the beginning, middle, and end, and if I cannot live up to that then they are suffering. So that's what I do.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Jeffrey has two beautiful Akitas.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, my babies. What else do you want to know?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's so funny. Well, the next question, and I think those were the exact answers that maybe I might have gotten if I thought a little more or do a little more meditation, but I have a feeling that this is something that you've already given to me just by being around you. What I asked you in the car was, I asked you, do you think that confidence and consciousness can be [00:05:00] identified at a glance?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yes, definitely, but it's not something that's put upon you, it's a condition that you have within, but you have to identify in your growth. Sometimes it remains dormant and somebody like myself has to trigger it and then you recognize it and then it will blossom, it will grow. Somebody did it for me, and the person didn't know they did, but I recognized it and I said, ''Oh, okay, I need this tool and I need to use it.'' Because it's the thing that made me forgive my father for all the things that he did to my mom. He hated me, my father, he hated the very ground I walked on because I was interested in theater, and he thought I was the biggest sissy walking, from a Jamaican background, there's two things you don't do.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Macho.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yes, you're a sissy if you go into theater and you are a sissy if you sing or in the choir.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's the same thing in the Latin background too.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. That was my calling, I was drawing.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You're definitely not a sissy, Jeff. I know you're made real tough.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I'm a good sissy if I am.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Good tough sissy.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But when I was younger, they would catch me drawing, and I only drew organs from the human body or some other animal anatomy or something. I'd draw skeletons and I'd draw them perfectly, and they thought that I was going to be this doctor and we have to encourage this because he's going to be a doctor and so forth. Little did they know that I had no interest in being a doctor, it's the artistry of the drawing and being able to look at something and capture it in my brain and put it on paper.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I didn't know you could sketch Jeff.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	A lot of things you don't but, that's why we're having this interview done. So it was something that I discovered because they drilled into me, ''Oh, yeah, you're going to be a great doctor.'' When I saw the amount of time a doctor had to put in, all that just started to stifle the creativity immediately.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I know exactly how that feels.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I said, ''No, I don't think so.'' But I went to college and I looked at all the majors being offered and so forth, and my God said, ''No, medicine is not it, that's not it.Interviewer:	Jeff I would like to ask you a question.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yes.Interviewer:	You said someone helped you identify your consciousness and helped raise that. Who was that?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Vinnette Carroll. Vinnette Carroll was the first African-American female director on Broadway.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Wow.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	This is where I got divine consciousness. It was at an early age because my mom took me to see a movie at the Rialto Theater in Jamaica. Now, my father was taking me to see all the Westerns and stuff. He wanted to toughen me up so he only gave me Westerns. My mom said, ""No, you are going to see a real film.""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Just slingshotting you back and forth.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Mom took me to see One Potato, Two Potato. It was a film. It was about this nanny in the South who took care of this white family. It just turned out that that was the mainstay of the family. She was the stalwart leader, being the nanny. Everybody, mom, dad, all the children would turn to her for everything. She had to be there and she was not getting the respect she was due at that time, back in the late '50s, early '60s. She was black. She was put down. After the film, I said to my mom, ""Mom, that's what I want to do, what that lady is doing right there."" She looked at me, she smiled. She said, ""Okay."" That was it. About 29 years later, I ended up in New York and got into this workshop with a lot of the luminaries that are out today. This friend of mine said, well, this woman is auditioning for a West Indian witch doctor who can sing and dance. So I was a triple threat.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You can sing and dance, act.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yes. I started out dancing. I went to the audition. I went in and she welcomed me and she gave me the side to read. I read it. All of a sudden she called in other members of the cast and we read together. It was about 16 of us auditioning, and I was about the fourth. I was there for about an hour and a half, having fun with these people. [00:10:00] The assistant came in and said, thank you, we'll see you all tomorrow. I said, ""Is tomorrow the callback? What's up?"" I had been an hour and a half. She said, ""No, darling."" She said, ""You got the job."" I said, ""Really? I got the job?""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Awesome.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. Later on I found out she sent everybody home after I came in. She sent everybody home after she saw me. Anyhow, about three Broadway shows down the line, she got me on Broadway with Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope. Three Broadway shows down the line I was doing But Never Jam Today. It was an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I remember that one.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I was playing the Cheshire Cat.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	So cool.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The posts in New York gave me this big article, but the reviews came out the same day the article came out. The review said, the show is great, blah, blah, blah, but the Cheshire Cat and the Director are feuding. I went to Vinnette and said, ""Vinnette, did you know we were feuding?"" She laughed. She said, ""Darling, it's when they don't talk about you.""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Whatever gets seats in the chair.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yes. ""When they don't talk about you that you have to start worrying."" But I kept reading the article. It said and she did this and she did that, it was her bio now in the article, and she did this. Then I saw One Potato, Two Potato. This was the black woman I saw on screen as a boy in One Potato, Two Potato.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Predestination.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	This woman was responsible for my first breakthrough.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	First breakthrough and your first inspiration.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	She was my stage mother. Every day I would go down from Mount Vernon, down to the city, to sit with Vinnette; a whole group of us. Reggie VelJohnson, a whole group of us, people who are stars today.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Reggie?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. Went down and sat with her, and didn't have no money, no nothing. We would just learn. God, we just absorbed everything this woman was putting in. There was no video of the stuff that she did because it wasn't popular.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's a mystery school.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. It wasn't popular. This will probably be the only thing that has records of Vinnette's work.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Reference.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The beauty was that all those people who are luminaries now, at that time with Vinnette, we would get together and go to the Cuchifrito. It was Chinese people that cooked Latin food and had Chinese food as well. We'd go there and we put all the money out on the table. We say, okay, we have $12, lets look at the menu. Then we would look at the menu and say, okay, lo mein is a lot, and this over here is a lot, there's a lot of it. We would order the three things and get 10 plates.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Sure.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Everybody would have a full belly before they left and we'd have enough for tip. That's how we got fed. That's the woman who just taught us.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's family.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. In answer to your question, Vinnette Carroll was that person.Interviewer:	What did Vinnette look like?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Vinnette was Mother Earth. She was a very robust black woman who was about five feet, eight inches. She was big in front, very bustacious, and big behind, had a good following, and a very deep voice. She was like, ""Yes, darling."" People would call her and she'd would answer the phone, ""Hello?"" Then they say, ""Sir, is there-"" Then she'll say, ""I'm not a sir. I'm not a sir."" She would always get that, but she had the deepest voice.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Her voice had authority.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. If you do YouTube and go on any of the interviews that the Vinnette Carroll might've had, you'd hear how deep her voice was.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	How do you spell her first name? V-I-G?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	No. V-I-N-N-E-T-T-E, and Carroll is C-A-R-R-O-L-L. She had double letters in both her names.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That's good.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But Cicely Tyson is Cicely Tyson because of Vinnette Carroll. Sherman Hemsley, because of Vinnette Carroll. Brock Peters.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Reggie.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Reggie, myself. A host of people is because of the Vinnette Carroll, and Vinnette Carroll did not get her due. Did not get her due because she wasn't about that. She wasn't about that. She'd get Broadway shows going and they'd want to give her millions just to take the property and she's like, ""No, darling, I'm not selling my soul."" So she could keep the integrity of the piece. She didn't care about stardom. Do the work. Do the work. That's what she drummed into me as a Director.Interviewer:	What are some of the things she told you?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	She taught me that tomorrow is not promised, so get [00:15:00] what you can out of the work today. Get what you can out of the relationships today. Say everything that you have to say today, in the moment.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Live now.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Live now because tomorrow is not promised. If you go, if the Lord takes you tomorrow, there are no regrets. I live by that. The main thing I got from her was the stardom and all that will come, but have the work speak for itself. If you get hit hard, you will cry, but don't get hit hard and act like you're crying. That's not true work. If you're true to the feeling of being hit.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Allow the feeling to impact your soul.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. Then you will cry automatically. So stardom will come if the work is good.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's a byproduct of focus.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. Don't strive to become a star. Strive to do excellent work.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes. Excellent. Well, with that being said, what was the proudest moment of your life?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	My son's birth, my first son. That was the proudest moment.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Alex?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	No. This is Leonard in London. Stephen Leonard Anderson-Gunter. He's going to kill me. He hates his middle name.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well, now it's in the Library of Congress.Interviewer:	What do you remember about the day he was born?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The fact that I was instrumental in the production, I mean, just the whole biology of it, that got together with that and that that's coming out is the product of that and it's like, my goodness. I mean it really got into,Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Mind blowing.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	how miraculous is that. Then you saw everything, membranes and things and so forth and you got over there just like, ""Just clean it off, I want to see his face, I want to see, does he look like me?"" He didn't look like nobody I knew, not a soul. Because you got to grow into it. Of course some of the attributes are mine, some of the attributes are the mom's.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Mother's.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But the blessing was that both of them, they made good choices because of how I reared them, and the mom had input but there was a whole familial disagreements and so forth.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It happens.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. But the second proudest moment though was when I opened on Broadway in my first Broadway show, and my mom was able to come-Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Awesome.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	and see. She supported me in everything but she didn't understand what the dickens I was doing. I mean it's like, ""Okay, this is a phase. He'll get over it.""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That's how you know she loves you. She doesn't care about what you're doing,Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	She loves you regardless of what,Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Unconditional.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	you choose to do.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	She taught me unconditional love.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	My mum is the same way. She doesn't care about anything I do. She just,Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	supports you. That's how it should be.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Mom you should care, I realized that is caring.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	That's agape love, that's the kind of love that Jesus gave. I can't understand. It incensed to me this past week and I'm going to go very current now about this guy who burned the Quran and the repercussions because of that and it's like, ""What was he thinking?"" He's a preacher. It's like, ""Did he ask the question, what would Jesus do and really answer that? Did he ask that?"" Because it's the repercussions is not on the people who bother to uphold the teachings of the Quran. It's back on America and the Americans.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's treachery.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The thing that incenses me is that he didn't give us a choice. He selfishly made some decision, some judgment on his own and acted on it and disregarded us and what we thought and what repercussion would come to us because of his actions. Now, we have to go ahead and help and support him that he doesn't get harmed because we are Americans and that's what we do. You've got to think.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's the symbology of the action that causes the most damage. The word itself is not burned. The words of God are immutable whether they're written on paper or not and I hope that people can see that and that they can also understand that we are not every person in America, we [00:20:00] are as diverse as every different people in the world.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But listen, we are the best experiment going. I say we because I'm Jamaican, well, I was born in Jamaica and I became a naturalized citizen in 1976 on Ellis Island and it was one of the most,Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Congratulations.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	proudest moment of my life.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	When my mom was naturalized, it was the same for her. She cried, we all cried, it was seven years coming.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The thing is, when that happened, well, first of all, I had two Russians on either side of me, Mikhail Baryshnikov was on my left and Yakov Smirnoff, the comedian was on my right. So in all the news publicity and stuff, I was getting the pictures because they were luminaries, I was a little nobody in between them but we were in the A's and I'm an Anderson and so there I was sandwiched between them.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You got laughs in between?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Listen. I was great because they wanted to know about my culture and what was happening with me, because they found me fascinating because they thought I was African-American.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	They realized you're not the American hyphenation.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	They found out I was Jamaican, they had never been to Jamaica and what is a Jamaican?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah man.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, all of that. They were very pleased. But to say that, at that moment, it really came into my realization that I am now a part of one of the greatest experiments going. This thing called America and it's the reason people try to emulate us. Yes, there's a lot of wrong, but what about the things,Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Focus on the good.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	that are right? You know what I mean? Look how far we've come. Look who is in the White House now.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That was my next question. Did you ever think you would live to see a black president, a multicultural president of America?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	No. I wept like everybody else because it was in my lifetime is like, ""My goodness gracious, I'm actually watching this and I can live through it. Trying to help and get into the another four years."" He is doing a great job as far as I'm concerned. The thing is we are such an immediate society. Things have to be done now. We don't go through process, we just want to action. Now I think he's trying to teach us in his own way, he'll never say it. But I think he's trying to teach us ""folks, the things are in sight, the list is there, but we have to do one at a time and it has to be a process"". Everything is a process. You begin here, you go to this point, get something else and move on to the end. But they don't get it yet.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well look at the act he had to follow.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Not just one act, two acts. That he had to follow. Bush was in the seat of presidency for two terms. That's a long time.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But the blessing is he didn't point fingers.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	He never yeah, he never did.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Which is,Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Very classy of him.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	very classy and it's a sign of a great person.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I haven't heard him down talk anyone. He has been very respectful of just about every culture and person.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Listen, I was very honored when I met him. I met him at a breakfast, I was very honored and he wasn't president then. He was just a senator, not just a senator, he was a senator because that has its own thing.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	He was presidential.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	He was very presidential. Listen, after that first speech I said ""Okay, here we go, Lord, please don't let nobody kill him please.""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Thank God. He has the best security around him that any president has ever had and so I don't think that's going to happen.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Let's go back to my story.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	The happiest. Well, the saddest moment of your life.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	When mom died. But it was the saddest and the happiest because being spiritual we both know that you're born, you live and you die.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You have to.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	We all have to go through it.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Transition.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	The only thing we have control over and we really don't. But the only thing that we can manage as people is the middle, thePedro Eduardo Oribe:	The living now.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	living aspect. Exactly. Living and the living in the moment, all of that. But when mom told me about her condition, she died from cancer and it-Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	SorryJeffrey Anderson Gunter:	had spread and all that.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	My grandmother currently is battling.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Is battling it?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Cancer.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Send my prayers for her majorly. I was having my birthday in September and she told me in July what was going on. I had a prognosis that it wouldn't be but maybe a few months or so. So I said, ""You know what? I need to go back to New York and just be with her for this birthday. So I went back to New York and it was evident that there is something, some little [00:25:00] cloud over and so forth but it didn't matter to her, we joked and carried on and so we were in the bedroom and we're planning her funeral. We're going through what songs to sing and so forth and she wanted this song that was acquired, wasn't a solo song. So I said, ""Mom but you can't have that, that's acquired."" She's like, ""This is my funeral, I want that song.""Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	She can call the angels down to sing behind you.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I said, ""You want me to sing it?"" She said, ''You can sing? You can't sing'' So we had a big joke and stuff about that. Then there was a chest of drawers and it had a mirror and I looked on top of the chest of drawers at some point and I saw this decal of a ladybug up there and it was very faded and I said ""Mom, why don't you take that down, it's faded, don't look good, "" and so she said, ''You leave that right where it is because the kids gave it to me.'' Now, the kids is my sister's children, her grandchildren.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	No mess with the kids.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	We're not on that. She said, ''I love ladybugs.'' I said, ""I didn't know you like ladybugs."" She said, ''Yeah, I love ladybugs.'' Anyhow, she died and I did the eulogy and stuff and we buried her somewhere in Yonkers and it's at the end of October that we buried her. Now, ladybugs, they die or go dormant or something at the end of August, they can't stay cold. Here we are in the end of October, we're in winter and it's like about 29, 31 degrees and I come out of the car going down to her grave site, flowers all over the place and ladybugs up every striking color all over the place, and at the time I had my dreads.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Oh my god.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	They were flying in my dreads and so forth and so on and I looked and I said, ""Okay, you're all right."" I said, ""I got it."" But nobody else knew. Nobody else knew about that particular sign about the ladybugs because we were the ones that had this conversation about the ladybugs and stuff in her room. Anyhow, at the hotel the next morning, I was brushing my teeth and one flew out of my hair onto the sink and I put my pinky down and then it climbed on my pinky and I looked at it and I said, ""Yeah, I know. You're okay."" I put it out the window and the ladybug flew away. I told my pastor that story to, oh gosh, everybody.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Everybody started crying.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah because when I brought her here to the church, she was a very sedate, very shy lady and so forth but I had to introduce her to the congregation because, I had started the sign ministry at the church and I was on the usher board of the church and so forth, so it's like Jeff's mom is here. So I had to introduce her and oh gosh, she could have killed me. But I introduced her and everybody met her and just thought about how a wonderful human being she was so when I told the story, they just went up. They went up, but that was the best moment for me to see those ladybugs all over the place at her grave site at the beginning of winter.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Such a scary but exhilarating experience.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, so that was my sad but happy moment. You miss her, you grieve, and you go on but the things that she gave me, she lives in me.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	They never leave.Interviewer:	What's your mother's name?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Iris Louise Young was her maiden name, and she married Milton. So it's Iris Louise Young Milton.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Milton.Interviewer:	Aside from the image of the ladybug, when you think of your mother, is there anything else, any other image you see?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Well first of all, she was half-Chinese. My grandfather on my mother's side was full Chinese. He was from Hong Kong.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Wow.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	So that's where the Young comes from. So she was this very short half-Chinese lady who was the strongest human being I ever knew, and she went through some things. I saw her endure some things that I don't know if anybody else could, and it's really where I really appreciated women and what they had to go through in life and the kind of men that take advantage of them, that beat on them, and so forth and that's why I mean.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Might is not right.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Right.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Strength is not.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. Today if I see a woman being beaten up or something, I go berserk.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Stand up for them.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I go berserk. I get into more fights because of men beating up women than anything else, and you know I don't fight.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I just think it's not a place to go. If I can't talk to you, it's not a place [00:30:00] to go.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	They say the only thing that needs to happen for evil to prevail is for good people to stand by and not do anything.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	So our responsibility is just to do something when that evil is attempting to prevail.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That would be the only reason to go to protect.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. The last time that I was with my father and mother in the same place was the day he came in and started beating on her. At the time in his, quote unquote, wardrobe. We called it a wardrobe, but it's a big cabinet where he kept all this stuff that he didn't want nobody else to touch. That's where all the clothes that I had to wear to special places was kept, and he might have bought it when I was six and I'm 12 now and the clothes are still in the wardrobe. We haven't gone anywhere, so we've outgrown them and those new clothes he has to give to somebody else. We never went anywhere.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Wow.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But the clothes would stay there. Love him wonderfully but you know. Anyhow, that particular night.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	His father might have been the same way to him.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I don't know.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You might have stopped the long.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I had to.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Behavioral.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. I had to stop that whole line, but that night he had in the wardrobe a baseball bat, a dagger, and a nightstick.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I have a feeling he was hiding other things behind that.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Whatever, but I took them and I threw the dagger in somewhere out in Jamaica somewhere and took the baseball bat. He was hovering over my mother, punching her and I let him have it. I let him have it with that baseball bat. I saw red. I was just swinging I was just making sure I didn't hit my mother. He was a bloody mess by the time I was done.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well I'm glad you're free.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I'm glad that you beat the statistics. They say that,.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	People that have abusive parents are 700 more times likely to be abusive and you've always been the image of love and kindness to me. I could never imagine you being so red and hot-blooded.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	But you know why though? I had to go through that to arrive where I am today.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That's the reason you're so mellow?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, because I had to really experience that and see all of that. However bad it was, I have to bless the situation because I had to know that's not where I want to be. That's not where I need to be. Well, because of Vinnette also, I learned forgiveness and learned that it doesn't take you anywhere if you hold any grudges or anything. You have to break the cycle and forgive. You have to move on in order for you to move on.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah, you cut the ties between you and what is hurting you but with forgiveness.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	If you hold the ship on your shoulder you're carrying.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You're carrying it on.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	So my sons don't have it now because I stopped it.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I went back down to Jamaica and saw my father at the airport for the first time and hugged him. He could have gone six feet under.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Oh, he couldn't believe it.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Because he never hugged me, but I reached out and hug him.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	That's strength when you can reach out and forgive.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, and I broke the cycle. But the thing that really messed with him was when I was in college, I wrote him a scathing seven page double-sided letter telling him how I felt about him and so forth, how he treated my mom and the family and bla bla bla. On his deathbed, he was calling me and when I went down there, I missed him. He passed on before I got there but I had to dress him and so forth to put him into suits and all that. So in choosing the suits, in Jamaica they say you have to sew up the pockets I don't know why, but the tradition is you have to sew up the pockets.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Really?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, because of whatever. I got to research what that meant. Being a Virgo now, before I put it on him, I got to go through the pockets to make sure nothing is in there. Why? I have no idea.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's unfinished business.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You're right. But you know what?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You can't have any loose change.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I found that letter in the suit I chose.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Wow.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	That seven page letter.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	He kept it with him.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	He kept it.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	To remember?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I don't know. He had about 47 suits. What are the odds that I'm going to choose the suit that that letter is contained in?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Right?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	My last question was, are you psychic? Let's just jump straight to it.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I don't call it that. The stigma with psychic and so forth is bad. I just say I get information. I get information and I have to impart information and that's it. I just get information.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	You're downloading from the awe.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	[00:35:00] From wherever it comes, I like to think it's the divine and there you have it.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Keep your instrument working in.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Because if I don't divulge the information I get headaches, strong headaches. The good thing is people are telling me I should develop this. God, no, because it interferes with work, my life, and so forth.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	There's many time that you called me when at my worst, at my lowest and then when I don't want to call anyone, you always call and I don't even have the heart to pretend to try not to answer the phone because I know you know better. So I answer the phone and you usually or you always make me feel better.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Well, because it's sincere what we have, and I have several people in my life that I get information about and it's because of the purity of the connection, the sincerity. There is no false anything.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Thank you. I appreciate it very much.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Well, it's real man. It's real but you know that is not of me, it's of the divine. I'm merely channeling whatever the information I get.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well, the book you gave me changed my life, Conversations with God. I felt like there was my induction into clear conscious channeling. It's been the best tool for my career, for my life, for my relationships that anyone could give me. Thank you, Jeff.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Oh man, please. Anytime that anyone can pass on good, and concise, and sincere knowledge, then one has to. What that book did for me was just confirmed everything that I felt and couldn't put words to. I don't care what other people think about the book, what I read and what I understood.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It wasn't a religious book.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	No, it's not.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It's called Conversations with God.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	But it's not of a religious.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Not at all.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Nature. It's of a metaphysical.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah, everybody can relate.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Everybody can relate. Who's to say it is or is not what it is?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	The book doesn't even say that.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. It's like God is the I Am, the book is. That's it. What are you going to say? The thing that is prevalent in it is Agape love, and starting from there, and if you're true to that and you live it, then everything falls into place, everything has to.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	The greatest thing I got from that book was your highest, your clearest, and your grandest. Your highest thought is the part that contains love.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Right.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Your clearest word is the word that contains truth, and your grandest emotion is the one that contains love. If you can't have your highest, clearest, and grandest in any of your decisions, well, then you know you are not being true to yourself.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It was integral for me to be able to make the decisions that I needed to make in life, especially coming into the entertainment business. There's so many ways you can go and so many directions people can steer you.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Well, let me amend that though. It's not decisions you made, it's decisions that were made for you that you needed to follow.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Okay.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Because the decision is already made, you just need to recognize them and follow in the path.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I'm still trying to understand that relationship a little more. It's getting there, but it's the predestination of my choice.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Well, you see, the thing is we have no control over it. The things that are, are there. But we haven't met all of those things as yet. As we go along the journey, we meet them. The task is to recognize what they are and follow through. Listen, we're being told things every day.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Listen, yes, listen.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Listen, see, and really look. You know what I'm saying? Because we see every day. If that bottle is there and we pass here three times a day and know that that bottle is there, we don't see that bottle. The bottle becomes invisible, because it's there. But if you come in you look and you see the bottle, it's like, that bottle is there. You know what I mean? It's all relative to what we should be thinking, but we have to identify those things. You know what I'm saying? So that it can be a part of our makeup, so that things that we need to really recognize and listen to, it will come like that.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes. So we can live and operate from a more natural, not innate, like a divinely innate point of view. My last question was going to be to ask you what advice would you give to the future generations and I think that that answered that [00:40:00] question. My last and final question is, how would you like to be remembered, Jeff?Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I would like to be remembered as the guy who wanted to make everybody laugh and be joyful every day of their life. That is my task. That, and giving is as my task. I had to learn how to receive and the divine had to teach me how to receive because I was so adamant not to receive. I'm going to be the giver, and if you can't take it, then I'm going to be evil. No, that's part of giving. Receiving is part of giving, because if I deny you the feeling I have.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah, then you're receiving.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	But you think you're giving.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Yeah. You know what I mean? So it has to be reciprocative. It has to be a balance. So I give, so I learned how to receive, and that's how we balance it.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	It also teaches you in your relationships, is to have that balance is to let someone give and let someone receive, and then when it's getting stopped up, you know where to ameliorate.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly, which is why getting into relationships is not always what, can I get out of it? What can I bring to it?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	What can I bring to this relationship? If both people are bringing and they're meeting in the middle on what's brought, then you have a lot to do, a lot to talk about, and you're still individuals.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah, it's not a relationship of completion, it's a relationship of complement.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Exactly. If there is disagreement, that means there is learning.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yeah, and it's fine.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	It's fine, but people don't realize that. Everybody wants this perfect relationship so there should be no disagreement.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	No.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You've got to learn. That's why there's disagreement, because you have to learn.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	To be kind, to forgive, and to have patience.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	In the disagreement, it means there's something somebody's not getting and something that is that somebody else is not, so find out what those things are and learn to disagree.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Accept.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Accept it. You know what I mean? That's definitely a part of what the Agape love end result needs to be.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well, Jeffrey, I would like to tell you that I will definitely remember you as the person who made me laugh, put a smile on my face, and also lifting me out of unconsciousness.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Amen.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Thank you.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	I didn't know you were unconscious.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	No. Well, growing up, you caught me at a very pivotal time in my life and I needed the guidance that you offered me and I want to thank you.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Oh, man.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Deeply.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	You're most welcome through the divine, you're most welcome. We're handed a bunch of stuff on the blank page when we're children, and we then have to look at the blank page and see what works for us and what doesn't work for us. Not what's right and what's wrong, what works for us and what doesn't work for us, because what's for you might be not for somebody else and vice versa. You know what I mean? So it's incumbent on folks like yourself who is willing to look in and learn, and be a sponge, and ask questions all the time, is the only way you're going to learn. Observe the disagreements and the conflicts as a learning experience, because that is what will eventually lead you to higher enlightenment. Because we're all one, we just haven't found out yet.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Well, Jeffrey, I will do my best to not only remember you in my heart, but in my actions, and to pass it on. Everything that you've taught me, I will pass it on and I'll pass it on to my little brother.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Good. Your first born will be called Jeffrey, yes?Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes. I'll call him Jeff. Jeff, if you're hearing this right now, this is your namesake. This is a great man. I consider you one of my fathers. My father has been a great influence on my life and you both remind me a lot of each other, both very connected, and I just like to thank all of my fathers this moment in time for being there for me and not letting me slip into the darkness.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Amen. I'd love to meet him one day.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	He is coming next month so you'll meet him.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Good. So I'll get a chance to meet him.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	I've been waiting for this for a while actually.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Good. We'll have a coconut water together.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Yes. Well, Jeffrey, thank you so much.Jeffrey Anderson Gunter:	Thank you. It's been a pleasure.Pedro Eduardo Oribe:	Namaste.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
MBY007696,"Jess Renandes:	[00:00:00] So my name is Jess Renandes. I'm 19 years old. Today is April 8, 2011 and we're in Los Angeles, California.Suzy Surplus:	My name is Suzy Surplus. I'm 20 years old. Today is April 8, 2011. We're in Los Angeles, California.Jess Renandes:	So I asked you to come here because I want to learn about you and your struggles. So can you tell me how did you come here? Why did you come here? How was it?Suzy Surplus:	I came here when I was 16 and actually I had to fund in my trip coming over here because I had a lot of fun. I am from El Salvador so I had to go through Guatemala and Mexico. And the first two days, it was really hard because I spent most of my life on my country and I was really scared to leave my family, my friends and everything I had in there. It was really hard at the beginning but then I kept thinking about my mom and that I was going to see my mom for the first time. That gave me a lot of hopes to come over here and not to give up. I remember that we got on a bus and we got to a certain point that we had to go under the bus where you put your luggage because we were under age and we didn't have any type of papers. They said you can't go out of the country beside your parent or something, so I had to go lie under the bus and there was a lot of cape with me and it was for about a good 20 minutes that I was down there and after that, it was like whatever, so we just got out there and we got into a bus again. I spent a month in between Guatemala and Mexico and then we got to not the border but it was a river. So it wasn't a boat but it was something that was plastic and we had to fit in there. We had to be on our knees so we could make it to the other side and I remember that it was really cold and that this fat lady was kneeling on my knees and I was in pain because I was really tiny and she was big. She was in my feet and they were falling asleep but I had no choice to take it and I just hoped nothing's going to happen like the board is not going to flip or something like that. We made it to the other side then we waited for a car then they picked us up, then we went to this one house I think. Then the same day they picked us up and we had to go through some fences. It was nowhere because there was no houses, nothing. They just dropped us off and then we had to run and we got into the fence. I realized that we were like in the desert and we had to hide behind the trees and stuff. I remember there was really empty. There was no life in there.Jess Renandes:	Who's we?Suzy Surplus:	The group that I was because it was a little group like about 25 people I think. We were always together. Then I remember that we had to walk three days and two nights and we only took a break about 15 minutes and then we had to walk again. [00:05:00] I was really scared because it was like I was by myself because I came by myself. I didn't know what to do because I had no experience and it was a lot of walking for me. It was really scary. I don't know but then we made it and I remember that I first saw a CD and we were in Texas and I saw the buildings and I was like ""Oh, my God I'm in the USA."" I was so happy and I was like I want to see my mom. I'm here and for the first time in my life, I saw the USA in person not in the TV or something like movies and stuff. It was like my dream came true and it was a really nice experience. I had a lot of fun and if I had the chance to do it again, I'll do it again because I had a lot of fun and I met a lot of people through the trip I made because we were in Mexico and we went to, I don't know Chihuahua. Well, a lot of places and it was really fun. I really like Mexico.Jess Renandes:	Where were some of the other fun parts?Suzy Surplus:	The days we would spend at the hotels because there was a girl who we became friends because of the trip and she was really close to me. We were really close to each other. She would go to the bathroom, I'll go with her or I'll go somewhere she would go with me. We have a lot of talks because she was from somewhere away from the place I was coming from but we were from the same country. I had a lot of fun because I had somebody to talk to and we would share a lot of stuff through our life and stuff.Jess Renandes:	So how did you feel when you first saw your mom?Suzy Surplus:	It was the first time I see my mom in person because she left me when I was two years and a half, so I had no idea how she was, how she looked other than pictures I saw her. I was really happy but she was really not into it. She was just like whatever. She told me oh, I'm happy that you're here. Then she hugged me and she was like okay, let's go and I looked at her and I was like I thought you were going to cry or something. But then I just got on the car. I don't know. It wasn't what I was expecting but I guess.Jess Renandes:	So why did your mom leave you? What were her reasons?Suzy Surplus:	Honestly, I don't know because they never told me. They just told me that my mom was away from me and that she was going to give me a better life but she was more she will give me love through material stuff other than giving me love like hugs and stuff. I would always feel bad because I went to a school with just girls and I really May it would be mother's day and all the moms, they were always there and I would be like where is my mom? My mom's not here and I would be part of the stuff they will like May that answers and seeing and stuff. They would be singing for their moms and I was just standing there like I'm singing but my mom is not here. It was really hard.Jess Renandes:	How did you mom feel about you coming here? What was it like? Your relationship with her?Suzy Surplus:	We [00:10:00] never got along in the fact that we were in contact but I never felt that love, a mother's love. A daughter love towards your mom but it was really weird because until this point we don't get along. It's just weird that she's my mom and we don't talk like we're supposed to be. I don't know, it's confusing. The failures are confusing because she's my mom but I don't feel the love I should feel for my mom. So it's just another person in my life.Jess Renandes:	Who do you miss the most from El Salvador?Suzy Surplus:	My grandparents. I grew up with them. I was really mean with my grandma. I'd always tell her that she was the one who made my mom leave. I was really mean with her. Until this point, I feel bad because I would tell her, ""I wish you'd die"" or ""you did this"". I would tell her a lot of bad stuff, and I would feel really angry. The fact that I never had my mom, and she would always tell me, she said, ""She is going to come back"", and it never happened, and I would always regret having my grandma with me and I would tell her, ""I regret having you in my life. I wish that instead of you being here home, it was my mom."" If I really had a chance to go back in life and change something, that's something that I would really change. Because when I left, my grandma got really sick, and until now, she's still sick, she's having health issues. I blame myself because I was the only one, it was just my grandpa and my grandma and me. Now it's just the both of them home alone. I know I feel bad because I think she's getting sick because of me. She needs me, and I'm scared that one day she's going to, I hope it doesn't happen, but I feel like one day she's going to die very sad or something. That's why sometimes I think about it and I feel like I need to go back and be with my mom, my grandma and take care of her. But I know I can't because if I go back, I'm not going to be able to come back. The sad part is that if I go over there, there's not, I'm not going to do anything over there because there is no job. I'm not going to have a better life, and that really hurts me a lot.Jess Renandes:	Suzy, if you could say anything to your grandmother about this, what would you want to tell her?Suzy Surplus:	That I'm really sorry. Deep in my heart, I'm really sorry. I would give my life for her. She's the best thing that ever happened to me, and I thank God for giving me a person like her because she's like my mom and that I feel really sorry about all the stuff I said. That I'm going to be a better person, and I'm going to show her that I changed [00:15:00] a lot and that I'm not the mean person I was before. That I'm going to do a lot of stuff to make her proud of me.Jess Renandes:	What's one of your best memories with your grandparents?Suzy Surplus:	I remember we would go trips everywhere. Thanks to them, I went to a lot of places around my country because they would take me a lot of places. I had a lot of memories with them because I was their daughter since my mom and my aunt came over here. I was the only kid in the house. So everywhere they would go, they would take me. I really appreciate the fact that they gave me a lot of memories, and till this time I still remember a lot of stuff, places we went and stuff we did.Jess Renandes:	Have you talked to her, Suzy after you have come here?Suzy Surplus:	I have, but not as often, because sometimes she's not home. But we try to keep in contact with her.Jess Renandes:	What are some of the struggles that you faced here once you were here?Suzy Surplus:	One of the biggest one, I would say, was one of my best friend dying. Unfortunately, I was over here, and sadly, it was on my birthday, and I felt bad, sad and angry at myself because I wasn't able to go over there and at least say bye for the last time or see her for the last time. I think that really hurt me a lot.Jess Renandes:	How is being undocumented affect you?Suzy Surplus:	Honestly, I think it affects me because of the fact that I really like to go places. I would love to travel around the world and meet new people, go around the world and just see like the difference between some places, and I can't. I can't even go to school because I don't have any type of help from the government. Since I'm 20 years old, I have to pay for everything myself because my mom was like, she will pay, but I just wanted to do it by myself to prove my mom that I can do stuff by myself without getting money or help from her. I want to show her that I can do it, and that I'm going to keep going, no matter if I don't have papers or not.Jess Renandes:	So how are you making it happen?Suzy Surplus:	I am trying to get a job, make some money. Then I'll try to go to school and at least get a nursing stuff, a diploma or something, and work and do a lot of stuff.Jess Renandes:	Suzy, what did you think life would be like when you came to America?Suzy Surplus:	What I thought?Jess Renandes:	You were traveling for a month, what did you think you would find at the end?Suzy Surplus:	I always thought that the United States were like in the movies. I always saw myself like in the movies, thinking I want to be there. When actually you see the reality, it's not a big deal. It's just a regular place. It's not like in the movies. In the movies they make it pretty, and clean, and [00:20:00] everything is beautiful but it's not. Once you come over here, you see the struggles of the people. They try to work hard and it's not the same, because some people can't. It's really hard. It's just a dream but to make it happen you have to go through a lot of stuff. I thought it was going to be a better place, but it's not. It's just like any regular place.Jess Renandes:	What happened to your other jobs?Suzy Surplus:	I had my first job when I was in high school. I quit because it was too much. Because I had to go to school and I didn't have any time to do my homework, and I had to go to school the next day. I'd be tired so I decided to quit.Jess Renandes:	What was that job?Suzy Surplus:	It was a food place at the prominent. I really didn't like it because there was a lot of food and I gained a lot of weight, and I didn't like that. That was one of my main reasons why I quit too. Then I got jobs here and there, like baby sitting, helping my aunt. Then I got a job at oz and they laid me off. Then I got a job at a shoe store, but I had some issues with the people in there. They told me that they don't need my help anymore. I'm looking for a job now.Jess Renandes:	What do you want to do with your life now? What do you see in your future?Suzy Surplus:	I see myself married with two kids, with the man of my life, and hopefully with a job and with a house, with a dog. I have a lot of plans with my life.Jess Renandes:	What are you going to do to reach them?Suzy Surplus:	Well, first of all, I need to get my life straight, and get myself into school and get my diploma of nursing, and start working on my life as a person. Maybe get married or something.Jess Renandes:	What kind of guy do you want to marry?Suzy Surplus:	I don't know.Jess Renandes:	What do you want him to be like?Suzy Surplus:	I'm really sweet, so I really need a guy who's sweet with me. I don't think there is a perfect guy, but I hope there is one that will treat me the way I should be treated. I hope that we love each other until the day will get wrinkly and old, and we have grandchildren.Jess Renandes:	Suzy, was language a problem for you?Suzy Surplus:	First it was, because I had to start school. I had to start to ingrain, and I didn't know what to say. I was really shy and I was scared. I had a lot of friends. The first day of school, I met a lot of people, and they really helped me a lot. I always felt that it wasn't the same because [00:25:00] I was different. I always felt different because I would never talk like them. I always felt bad. I felt if I was just somebody different. I would have classes with people who knew how to speak English really well. I would start sweating, and shaking, and I would never say anything in class. After I got more comfortable, I knew that if I wanted to learn a different language, I would make it possible if I really wanted to make it happen, and I did.Jess Renandes:	What makes us such good friends?Suzy Surplus:	I think the fact that I open myself to you, and that you helped me a lot through a lot of stuff. You really mean a lot in my life. You're like my sister now because we have a lot of things in common. I see you in my life in the future.Jess Renandes:	What kind of things do you have in common?Suzy Surplus:	She's short like me, she's funny, she's outgoing and she's a really good person.Jess Renandes:	Well, thank you. Thank you for coming.Suzy Surplus:	No problemJess Renandes:	Was there anything else you wanted to say?Suzy Surplus:	I think that if we keep on going on our dreams, instead of dreaming, we should make them come true.Jess Renandes:	Then one last question for me again. Suzy, you may heard this when you're 10 or 20 years older, is there a message that you want yourself to hear then?Suzy Surplus:	I know that I'm going to be old. But I just want this to be memorable because I known that I'm going through a lot of stuff, and a lot of struggles, but I know that I am going to do something with my life and I'm going to go far. If I believe, I'm going to make it happen.Jess Renandes:	Thank you.Suzy Surplus:	Thank you.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
MBY007714,"Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	[00:00:00] My name is Aurea Montes-Rodriguez, I'm 35. Today, we're in Los Angeles, California. Walter, I met you at Community Coalition, you're a leader with Kinship in Action. Over the years I've learned to care a great deal for you and you've become a dear friend.Walter Smith:	My name is Walter Smith, aged 71. Today's date April 13th, 2011. I'm in Los Angeles, California. I met Aurea at the Community Coalition, assistant executive. She had been very inspirational to me and informative in relative caregiving section.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Walter, I want to thank you for agreeing to have this conversation or to do this conversation because over the years you've shared so many stories about your life and your experience and they always move me. I just thought that it's something that we should record and have not just for your family members, but for our community, for South Los Angeles. It's something that we should cherish, your life experiences.Walter Smith:	I'm glad you were listening when I was talking. I guess I have a lot of stories to tell, I have some very serious experiences in the family life. As my family, we originated from Memphis, Tennessee, and I was a country boy. I think, maybe I had a calling for relative caregiving because I was injured at an early age, so I was taken out of the outside activities at my home and put into a home and I was placed where babysitting. As a result of that it's been easy and I was also identified as being very, I'm not bragging, very dependent because though my mother, my sisters, they would give me those kinds of chores so that had a lot to do with my, I would say, success with relative caregiving.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	That story always has stayed with me because you were a baby, you were six years old when you had the accident. So tell me that story again.Walter Smith:	I did what most kids do just what you're told not to do and I played with a gun. But is my older brother, they had been hunting the night before and they were going hunting early in the morning, and he asked me to bring him the gun. Like kids will do, they will check it out. The gun was too heavy for me to hold it in my arm like you normally hold and point, so I pointed it toward the ground so I could pull the trigger, not the trigger.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	The lever? Yeah, the trigger.Walter Smith:	Yeah. Because it was very hard and I let go and it blew my heel off.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Oh, my.Walter Smith:	That was when I think they put me and I spent about 11 months in the hospital, and I had a skin graft. One was very unusual and it was probably some of the first because they literally took flesh from my right leg, attached it to my left leg. I was in a cast until it grew onto my left leg, and then they detached it from my right leg and put it on my heel.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	That must have been so difficult as a child to be in the hospital for so long.Walter Smith:	Well, it was hard for them to get rid of me. It was like home and because at the time that it was, a lot of prejudice there, so they had a black and white area of the hospital, and they had a kids area and an adult area. So they had a very small space for kids and they didn't have any room so they put me in the adult [00:05:00] part of the hospital. I learned a lot, being six years old in the hospital with grown men and because at the time it took so long for the operation, I wasn't seriously ill, just injured, they would take me out of the bed on the weekend when they'd come in with a lot of the injuries and put me on the end of the bed in a cart. When that would fill up, then I'll be put in the hallway. So I learned a lot, I listened to adult talk.Interviewer:	What things did you learn?Walter Smith:	What things? I learned all the adult things because they were doing some things you wouldn't believe in a hospital. I found something that was very interesting that I never will forget. An old man came in, I didn't what was wrong with him, and he had a white beard and he wouldn't eat. They put me at the foot of his bed and he was the only talk-to-me and the only eat, I could feed him. One of the heartbreaking things was, I woke up from the foot of this bed on the cart and there was nobody in the bet, he had died overnight.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	You learned to be a caregiver as a child and you learned about death as a child?Walter Smith:	Yeah. I think that was leading to the man above. God was preparing me for that kind of things. The needed things, provide whatever need that I could provide. Those are my objectives.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So Walter, I want to talk about your role as a single father to eight children. But before we get to that the other story that really impacts my life is your experience when you joined the railroads. How about if we focus first on how you got to the railroad? You were on your way to becoming a teacher and then the equal opportunity bill passed and somebody told you about the Pacific Railroad Company hiring African Americans. Can you tell me about that?Walter Smith:	Yeah. All of this began with the equal job opportunity bill passing. My sister had a restaurant on the corner of Hoover and Forty-Second Street, and there was a man that came in and he said that they were hiring Black people in that class of service and the transportation service. Before then, it was only Black working as janitors, and chair cup holders, and stuff like that. But they were hiring you because of the equal job opportunity deal. They were forced by a quota to hire you in all other areas. I ignored it, but then eventually I went down to the 6th and Main, the PE building and I was interviewed on Thursday, me being one Black guy and a whole bunch of White guys. Then we took the aptitude tests, written tests, and then the physical, and the other part. I was hired, they would fill in a quarter.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you were one of the first African Americans working for the railroad?Walter Smith:	I was the third one in that class to service in the transportation class of service.Interviewer:	Why was working at the railroad more interesting to you than being a teacher?Walter Smith:	Well, being a teacher was my go from a child, because as I went through my high school years and I always was interested, as it's always seen the children wasn't getting in the basics, and I always felt I wanted to be the elementary school teacher. I figured if you're going to help a child you had to start at the very beginning, and that was one of the reason. Going from that ambitious, I went to LA City College, and I met [00:10:00] this lady, and we got married, and I was going to school, working, and I was married, and I finally had to quit school. So that's why I didn't finish that part of it.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Life happens.Walter Smith:	I got work on the railroad, and that was my call because it paid more money, and it was the long-term career opportunity job. That's one of the reason.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So was it easy to be one of the only African Americans working for the railroad at that period?Walter Smith:	Well, one of the worst experience I had ever had as far as prejudice, and call it barriers and stuff, because I was understanding that I'm now in Los Angeles, California, and I wouldn't experience the stuff that I would have to experience in Memphis, Tennessee. But it was even worse because the difference is in Memphis, you know, you don't go across the track. So you can build on your side of the track. Here, you can go across this track, as a ways to stop you from progressing, and my experience on the railroad was terrible. We couldn't find a place to stay, although, we would go to hotels like in Bakersfield, Indio, and San Luis Obispo, and they would tell you there will be vacancies on hotels and stuff, and the railroad would provide you a place to stay, they would pay for it. But when you go and ask for a room, they say, although you're with a crew of five people, they get to you and they say, they didn't have any vacancy. That was devastating to me, and you were made fun of. If you're working at night they would tell you, keep smiling so they can see you because your teeth is white, or keep your light on and all kinds of stuff.Interviewer:	Walter can I ask you, so when you were trying to get lodging at night and they say no vacancy, then what did you do?Walter Smith:	Well, you would go back to the, we called it the yard office, and that was very funny. It got to be funny because you go back to the yard office, and the clerks and staff would be standing behind the counter and they'd be laughing and talking like men do and when they see you come in, they would all disappear.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Leave you alone?Walter Smith:	Yeah, because they just about knew what was happening. They would tell you to go to the chief dispatcher. Well, you'd be already passed to the chief dispatcher, you'd go to that Cheney, we called him Cheneys, and he'd say, ""Well, all I could do is give you a voucher,"" and would give you a voucher and would call the carrier to give you a ride to the Greyhound bus station, and it would then head you back to Los Angeles. It didn't make any sense because they pay you to ride the bus.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you figured out a positive out of that horrible situation.Walter Smith:	Oh, I loved it. You didn't make as much money but you had plenty. I mean, you would land back in the bus, so I'll sleep, while I'm making money, and the strangest thing is amazing, biggest Southern Pacific company of that nature was, they were aware of it, but they didn't try to correct it because that crew that you were on could not bring a train back to LA until they build a crew. So they had to replace you. So they had to call another man up the board and do the same thing, put him on the bus, and-Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Get him there.Walter Smith:	Get him there. It was crazy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Instead of figuring out and dealing with the racism, it was easier for them to pay you to go back home, bring in a new person to take over your spot, slow down probably their schedule or throw their schedule off, instead of just really working on the desegregation?Walter Smith:	That kind of bigotry and stuff like that has always been crazy to me. [00:15:00] In my experience in life, you have plumbing problems or you put in plumbing very expensive, why would you put in two sets of plumbings when one set of plumbing would do, with white and black bathroom? I can't understand that. Supposed to be the smartest people existing on the planet earth and go that route, I never could understand that.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Every time that you share that story with me or those stories, I have a hard time thinking just about how young you are and how recent in our history those experiences of extreme racism are. I just really thank you for sharing them because I know how difficult they are, but it really reminds me of why we work every day together to just address the racism that our children and our community continues to experience. But even with the overtness, not overtness where it's more subtle now, I can't even think about how I or families in our communities would deal with that level of overt racism that you experienced during that part of your life.Walter Smith:	I think one of the big problems they had with as far as the railroad, the job situation is, once you finish the training you had so many hours, something like flying the airplane. You had many hours in the art, and so many hours on the road and all that kind of stuff. Once you finish, and you went on what they called pay, you got equal money. You may have been there 25 years, you had six months of training, you started with the same pay, and they just couldn't see you being black and having the same pay.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Being equal.Walter Smith:	They have been there 25 years. They had the same classification, so you got paid the same.Interviewer:	Well, Walter, what was your job? What job did you do for the railroad?Walter Smith:	Conducting engineer.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you were an engineer. You had an equal pay and equal job as them, but they didn't want to have to have a relationship or interact with you?Walter Smith:	Right. Not equal seniority.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	That's right.Walter Smith:	They would say stuff like, ""Well, boy, what are you going to do with all that money?"" I would be smart and say, ""I'm going to buy me a boat. I want to build me a cabinet in a mountain."" I was trying to say I'm going to do the same thing you do with your money.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Things that you're going to do. I have a family too. I have aspirations. So Walter, the other part of the story that I love hearing when you share with me is how you loved having the money that you earned from the railroad, and how that made a big difference for your family, and how whenever you got a fresh, new $100 bill, you went to the post office, opened your safe. Share that story with me again.Walter Smith:	Well, it was a lot of money at that time, which it didn't take a lot of money because of my lifestyle or whatever. But I know I used to keep a $100 bill, and then we got paid on the 10th and 25th. Twice a month I got a new 100 bill, I've take the old one and put it in the post office and put a new one in my pocket. That kind of-Interviewer:	But where did it go? You put it in the post office?Walter Smith:	Well, post office at that at that time we had a savings. You can save money is private and confidential. It was just you and the post office at that time, supposedly.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Nice.Walter Smith:	So that was a way of saving money.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you were smart.Walter Smith:	Buying those things you buy at the post office.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you are smart. You were saving for the future, but also being a young man walking around with money in your pocket.Walter Smith:	Yeah. That's a good feeling.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	That's right.Walter Smith:	That's a good feeling. Yeah.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So Walter, you were living a great life. You were married, had two daughters.Walter Smith:	Yeah, two.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Life is looking good. You actually then end up going through a divorce and your sister passes away.Walter Smith:	My sister, [00:20:00] I had a sister in Memphis, Tennessee, she got killed by a 16-year-old girl and she had children. At that time, I had about divorced.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	It may sound different, but I was awarded the house.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	So I was in this big house by myself and I was going down the railroad, going through Walnut. It came to me because my sister's kids, her oldest daughter was in college and it messed up her life, it was going to break into her college, with the younger kids.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	She was going to stay.Walter Smith:	I am in this house all by myself. I'm going to call them and I get back in, and see if they want to take the two youngest girls. They were more than happy when I called. I called them one weekend and a week later, here I got her girls, six and eight years old.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you become a parent again to two girls?Walter Smith:	Yeah. Because my kids were awarded to them to my wife, which is natural at the time regardless of the circumstances, they always. The mother, the children, to the mother.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So what did your ex-wife do when she found out you were taking care of your nieces?Walter Smith:	While the rumor got out and especially with her people, I have a nickname, they call me Joe. That's short for the full nickname is Joe boy. Anyway, Joe has done very good with his nieces. So I come home from work one day and there was a bunch of suitcases and bags on my doorstep and two girls, they were mine. She say, ""Well, if I could take care of someone else's kids, I could take care of my own."" So she brought me mine, my kids.Interviewer:	What was that like for you?Walter Smith:	Beg your pardon?Interviewer:	What was that like for you to see?Walter Smith:	I was happy. Those are my kids. I say no problem with me and no problem. I didn't have any problem. I have a strong family. My background was a mother and a father. A very strong mother and father.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So now, Joe Boy, Mr. Walter Smith.Walter Smith:	Yeah, Joe Boy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Single with four daughters. No, tell me,Walter Smith:	Joe Boy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I don't know, tell me.Walter Smith:	It came out of a book. I'm going to look up on the internet. It came out of a book. A Joe Boy book. My sister was older than me. She was like the first grade, whatever when I was younger at home. I couldn't get rid of this book she would bring home. I learned how to read this book. So my daddy started calling me, Joe Boy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Joe Boy.Walter Smith:	Yeah. So that's a name, you'd really have to know me. To use that name. Joe Boy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I'm so glad. Now I'll start calling you Joe Boy. What was it like raising four girls all by yourself? What did that do to your single dating life?Walter Smith:	Well, it's sort of ruined my life. My single life-.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	This stud with a lot of money.Walter Smith:	Yeah, it didn't matter. The money, the women would say, for some reason they couldn't adjust to a man having children, having the responsibility, the full responsibility of children. So they would use the line like I wasn't good catch material because I would date you, go to dinner or whatever and you had to come home.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	You couldn't party all night.Walter Smith:	That kind of stuff. If you were going to plan some kind of trip or whatever you had to plan it, because I had to get a babysitter and make sure. But I was fortunate enough to have a family then. I had strong family support. Strong family support.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So your siblings and other family members helped you with the four girls?Walter Smith:	Yeah.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So Walter, I mean, you've talked about how when you went to the schools to address issues that the girls had, and the girls, and then you took on four other children after.Walter Smith:	The other ones came as a result of my daughter, those were my grandchildren.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right. So your sister developed mental health problems. Your daughter excuse me?Walter Smith:	My daughter.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Your daughter developed mental health problems and started having children of her own, but couldn't care for them. So [00:25:00] a second round again, you decide to take in more children and you're still single. Was that experience different from the first time? I mean, you're a little older, little wiser, but still single?Walter Smith:	That experience were harder to start because of the system. The way the system is designed.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	The child welfare system.Walter Smith:	The way the system was done. Well, the other, I never asked for any welfare, I didn't even know.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	You knew that people were getting assistance.Walter Smith:	I was I was making a good living. So I never even thought about welfare with my girls or paying child support. I had them in the house and I continued to pay child support because he said I would have to go back to the court. So I had to go ahead with our lives, I still took care of them. But the grand-kids, my daughter got on the county, but her mental stability, she didn't have the responsibility. The thing that you spoke they call the paper that you have sent once you've receive a check.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	You have to send it back in, she never would do that.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	The CA summon form. Yeah.Walter Smith:	She never would do that. She just didn't have that responsibility.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	She couldn't follow through.Walter Smith:	She couldn't follow through with that responsibility. Her mother moved to Palmdia. Well, her first baby, that was something you won't believe what a mother would do. My daughter was 16 and she had her first baby. I get a call from LAX and it was my little 16-year-old daughter, with a three day old baby, with the house coat on. Her mother put it on the air line. That's got to hurt.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Senteen I'm sorry.Walter Smith:	Yeah. I picked them up.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So she sent her over? She sent her over.Walter Smith:	Picked my daughter up. Yeah. With this three-day old baby. I'm sorry.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	You never have to be sorry with me. We've done these. Your stories are hard. I actually always just appreciate and thank you for sharing them with me.Walter Smith:	That has strengthened me. I have a spiritual foundation. So that's a help spiritually. Yeah.Interviewer:	What kind of help did you have?Walter Smith:	From the man above spiritually, has spiritual help. Through prayer and reading the word, following the word, that has been my strength.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So you take in your grand baby and you start all over again.Walter Smith:	Yeah. But then she kept having babies and she had another girl, and then she claims she was trying to have me a boy.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	All this for you Walter?Walter Smith:	She wouldn't have her tubes tied. And when I go to the hospital with her, the people would reject me because I was man.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	I would try to get them, the nurses to maybe say something to her in reference to having her tubes tied or whatever and they would ignore me, I don't know what they were thinking.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	I'm a man, I guess it was something that I never could understand it. I would think because you are a woman -Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	That's right.Walter Smith:	- you are a female, that you would be more of help to me.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Right.Walter Smith:	But I didn't I get that.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	They didn't understand that you have raised her and that you loved her, and that you understood -Walter Smith:	Right.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- her mental health condition -Walter Smith:	Right.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- and that you are caring for the children she already had had.Walter Smith:	Yeah.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I think that's the part that really breaks my heart when I hear your stories, that it's not common and in the work that we do when we organize a relative caregivers, and that's primarily women that come because they're grandmothers caring for grandchildren. And from the very beginning when you came and you walked through the door, [00:30:00] we knew that we had an opportunity to really talk about the role of men in families and in keeping children together with families. And to me, I think it's remarkable and it speaks so much about who you are and your spirituality Walter, of not only having have raised four girls when you were young and single, but then taking them four grandchildren, a second time around and doing it all over again. And then not stopping with your children, but then coming to Community Coalition with all of the women that were organizing and being empathetic to them because of your experience raising the children. And so I love the story, I love to remember, and this one is not a story but more of a memory for me of when I came to Kinship in Action. I hear from the women that you're taking them bowling, and that you're taking them to lunch and you're paying for all of it and you're retired. That was when I first started getting to know you a little bit more and I was like, who does that? Who takes a group of 12 women to share a meal and treats them all and then doesn't stop there. You then on Mother's Day, schedule a photographer to come in and take photographs of all of these beautiful ladies who got dressed up, because Mr. Walter Smith really wants to acknowledge what they've done for their children -Walter Smith:	Yeah. Absolutely.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- by taking photographs of them. Walter, you're kind but I think of those stories -Walter Smith:	Well.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- I think of those memories and I always cry too because I just can't believe that we have such strong men in our community. It gives me so much pride, it humbles me and that's why I have so much love and respect for you.Walter Smith:	No point necessarily I was trying to make other than they were mothers and grandmothers and their place deeply in my heart being mothers. I don't think the way things are today, I don't think women or mothers really realize how so goes a nation, so goes a woman. So goes a woman, so goes a nation. A woman dictates everything that a man does and especially children because even when your baby say daddy or Dada, normally it's said out of the arms of the mother. So it's the very beginning, the foundation of everything that we live for our future, our everything. So it's very very precious to me. Very special.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	So Walter I think you live your life in a way that tells me that even though you experience lessons as a child, and you've experienced racism in a very overt way, and even through all of that you triumphed and achieve the American dream, being a part of the middle-class. But even through all of that you've always said that children and family come first.Walter Smith:	Correct.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	And In South LA, with all of the work that we do, I think that every day we have to learn from you, and we have to just carve out the time like we're doing right now to have this conversation to hear from you.Walter Smith:	Well, to me the coalition and the involvement that they offer there is like a pool of water in the middle of the desert where when everything seems to be no hope, that everything seemed to be failing, you can come in the coalition, this pool of water, because the people that come here is very thirsty. They need the resources, they need to know how to activate policies. And that I've learned and that I've [00:35:00] experienced at the coalition. A lot of time as you're watching a geographic, you see like in Africa, there's a watering hole. There's all kinds of animals. They come there and in that particular area provides their desperate need for survival. And that's the way I see the Community Coalition.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Well, for me Walter, I think when I hear your long history and all that you've accomplished individually, in your family and at Community Coalition through Kinship in Action, you for me gives me hope -Walter Smith:	Thank you.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- and it gives me confidence that we are doing something good in South Los Angeles and that we are going to improve the quality of the lives of our families and our children. I think for me I make a commitment to you that -Walter Smith:	Thank you.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- everything that you share with me, I'm going to continue to, on a daily basis remember all of the stories, all of your experiences, and that when I work with young people in South LA and children, I'm going to make sure that they're at the front and at the heart of our work. And I want to make sure that elders like you always have the space and the center in our work because you all have cleared the path for us and have just done the work so that we can enjoy our life in our community.Walter Smith:	Well, the family is at the forefront of all of God's creation. Without a family, everything is like apart from everything. And with a family things are together, and that should be our number one issue as human beings in this life that we live.Interviewer:	Well, Walter, what do you want your family to know about you that they couldn't learn from anyone else?Walter Smith:	That they can depend on Walter. Walter is there regardless, Walter is there. And I think my family, especially my immediate family and my children, and we all know that. It's not like and I'm not saying is taken it as like a pat on the back, it's just something you do.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I agree.Walter Smith:	There's nothing I had to work at. It is just something you do.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I can vouch for that Walter. When we've done things where we haven't shown consideration or care because we're young or because we make mistakes, when we don't prioritize and elevate our families, and you remind us and you tell us and you correct us. You always do it with a very kind heart and at the end of that experience, we always know that when we call you and say, ""Walter, here's where we are, here's what we need to do."" You come right back, and you take charge and you take a leadership role in -Walter Smith:	Thank you.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	- the fight. And so I agree with you. I think that your family, and we're part of that extended kin and family, we know that we can always count and depend on Walter.Walter Smith:	Thank you.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Thank you Walter for agreeing. I know that at first when I asked you to have this conversation with me you said, ""What? Why? We do that all the time?"" But to me this is very special and I want to thank you.Walter Smith:	Yeah. This whole thing is amazing to me. I feel very rewarded that I was chosen for whatever reason I was chosen and I appreciate the Coalition and I appreciate this organization for the work they're doing and hopefully they continue and get bigger and stronger.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	I know we will be because of you.Walter Smith:	Thank you.Aurea Montes-Rodriguez:	Thank you.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
MBY007728,"Debbie:	[00:00:00] Hi, my name is Debbie and I'm 24. Today's April 16th, 2011. Location, we're in Los Angeles, California. My relationship to, I'm sorry?Kevin Soulless:	Kevin.Debbie:	Kevin. Sorry, we just met.Kevin Soulless:	All right. I am Kevin Soulless, I am 46. The date is April 16th, 2011. I am in Los Angeles, California and I just met Debbie today. So since we just met, I'm curious, where are you from? I mean, you came to the Dream Team LA meeting, are you an ally, or are you comfortable saying your status?Debbie:	Oh, yeah. Pretty much, I'm a dreamer and I came to Dream Team LA because I met Eric. I met him at this little panel that my friend was hosting. I just started talking to the rest of the people that were in the panel, and they told me about coming over. But I was always so busy and I really didn't know where to go. Finally I met a friend, and he brought me over. I was like, ""Okay."" So it was cool.Interviewer:	Just for the people who may not be familiar with the context? What is it? What does it mean to be a dreamer?Debbie:	A dreamer is pretty much a student that's going to college right now, but unfortunately doesn't have their residency or pretty much don't get any financial aid.Kevin Soulless:	The panel that you met Eric, Eric Bigote, right?Debbie:	Yes.Interviewer:	He was here earlier today.Kevin Soulless:	Yeah, Eric. He's got a very distinct handlebar mustache and he's always very entertaining. What panel was he speaking at?Debbie:	He was speaking right here at Ketelsen.Kevin Soulless:	Obviously about the undocumented status and dream act and stuff.Debbie:	Yeah.Kevin Soulless:	Okay. When did you become involved with the movement?Debbie:	Just being involved in the dream [inaudible 00:02:30] , I will say when I was in high school.Kevin Soulless:	What high school did you go to?Debbie:	I went to Bellman High.Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	Yeah. So I'm a [inaudible 00:02:40] baby.Kevin Soulless:	When you were in high school, did friends know that you were undocumented or?Debbie:	Shockingly, no. No one knew that I wasn't documented till I hit senior year. That's when everybody started applying for colleges and all that stuff. I couldn't go to a college of my choice because of the whole financial status. I was bummed because I had a really good GPA system. You need a GPA. So my next best thing was community college.Kevin Soulless:	Right.Debbie:	So that's when I started telling my friends I wasn't going to university because of my status and a lot of people were shocked actually. A lot of people thought I was from here and I told them, ""No, I've been here since I was two."" So I wasn't born here but I was raised here.Kevin Soulless:	Any of your friends, did they come out as well and were you surprised?Debbie:	Yeah. A lot of my friends came out and a couple of them, I was shocked too I was like, ""Oh, really?"" Okay. I've always been very open with my status, so a lot of them knew that I was undocumented. Interviewer:	Do you remember when you first realized?Debbie:	Yes, I was in middle school and I wanted to do those projects, the green team something, where they take you places and you clean. I wanted to do that and I was so hyper, like I was really looking forward for it, and I applied and they told me, ""Where's your social?""Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	I'm like, ""What's that?"".Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	I asked my mom and my mom told me you don't have a social and I was like, ""Why not? I'm from here."" Then she sat me down and she explained to me and I was mad because I'm like, ""Why? I want to work too, earn my little $20 too."" So yes, I was really pissed and sad because I couldn't work a summer job. So that's when it hit me. I was like, ""Okay, I don't have my status,"" and I was okay with it till I graduated high school.Kevin Soulless:	Then [00:05:00] you stopped being okay with it?Debbie:	Yeah. Pretty much I stopped being okay with it because I obviously I was in high school, so didn't have to work or anything.Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	Yeah. So working-wise, I was okay because I'll go ask my mom. I graduated high school, started looking for a job and that's when I was like, ""Okay, this is not right.""Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	Yeah. But I mean, within this time I was still being active in my community regarding AB 540. Yeah.Kevin Soulless:	So the panel you met Eric, had you become activist already or that changed? Or do you still consider yourself an activist yet?Debbie:	I don't know how to answer such a question because I was an activist for four years straight or for three years, and then I stopped because I move to Burbank and there's nothing out there. So I stopped for two years and I came back, and little by little I've been really getting back, getting back into the whole movement. Just getting to know people and get some more information about what I missed in the last two years.Kevin Soulless:	Okay.Debbie:	So it's a lot of information that I have to take in. It's taking baby steps, but I'm going to get there hopefully soon and get all the information that I need.Kevin Soulless:	That's good. So when you saw Eric, that was your first reintroduction to it?Debbie:	Not really. My friend was the one that was pushing me to be in the panel.Kevin Soulless:	Which friend was this?Debbie:	Her name was Rocio and she works at Ketelsen. She was the one that was like, ""Come on, you have to do it."" I was like, ""All right, fine."" I didn't know Eric or anybody, I was just there because of her and they started talking and I was like, ""Wow, I forgot that this is still going on."" It sparked that little light again and I was like, ""Okay, I have to do something."" Yeah. So I was like, ""All right, I'm going to go to the BTLA and I'm going to do something."" But I just didn't have the time and I lost information, so I couldn't make it and somehow, someone obviously brought me here like it was meant to be. Something like, ""All right, cool.""Kevin Soulless:	It's cool.Interviewer:	What about you Kevin, what's your history that's led you to be involved in the Dream team?Kevin Soulless:	I am considered an ally, meaning that, I'm a citizen and I'm actually third-generation Mexican-American. My family has always been very politically involved. In fact, my uncle was one of the founding members of the Brown Berets and very much involved in the moratorium and the whole '60s movement in Chicago power, in UFW he marched with Chavez.Debbie:	Oh, it's awesome.Kevin Soulless:	So even though myself I'm new to activism, what happened was I was working at a high-school, Green Dot Oscar De La Hoya High School over in East LA. I accompanied a group of students on their Northern California College tour and my daughter was there. She went to a different school but she just came with me because she was a junior also in high school. We were at one college, University of San Francisco and one of the girls asked, ""Do you accept AB 540 students?"" At the time I didn't know what that was and neither did the person doing the talk. But since then I've realized what she was bravely admitting that she's undocumented. For me, I really got involved when Arizona blew up when they passed their SB 1070, The Papers Please Law and I've got a very particular personal connection to it. Someone I went to high school with, a very good friend of mine at the time. His son was part of the Arizona nine that were arrested at the state capital.Debbie:	Oh, wow.Kevin Soulless:	Because if we remember, they all chained themselves there.Debbie:	Yeah.Kevin Soulless:	I saw his photo and I go, ""Oh, wow,"" and I saw the name Portugal, which is my friend's last name. So we started making the connection and it's so funny because it turns out not only was his son involved in the movement, but my friend David, he is also involved in youth ministry at his Catholic Church over there in Arizona, and I do work out here also with confirmation students. So that photo and getting the whole movement and it just became, I guess it was last April, about a year ago.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	So I'm relatively new to the movement.Debbie:	Oh, awesome.Kevin Soulless:	But I started getting information, I found out who the groups were. My first [00:10:00] action with the dreamers here, they did I think they call it Our Dreams Are Dying Rally. What they do, they got their cap and gowns, they went to Pershing Square and they just laid on the ground dead.Debbie:	Oh, wow.Kevin Soulless:	It was symbolic, their dreams are dying, and they had people with banners and other people would speak with a megaphone and other people would be on the ground. So what I would do is I'd stand on a sidewalk and the people would come by and ask me, ""What are they doing?"" I explained to them and saying, ""They're undocumented."" You get two reactions. Well, first of all, everyone was almost universally positive.Debbie:	Okay.Kevin Soulless:	It was like, ""Wow, something should be done."" First question they say is, ""Well, why don't they just go get their papers?"".Debbie:	If it were that easy.Kevin Soulless:	You're laughing. A lot of people don't know that.Debbie:	Yes.Kevin Soulless:	There's no way to adjust your status when you're here, you've got to go out, wait a long time and come back. So they're stuck here and they say, ''Something should be done.'' It was interesting to see the support, I was talking with a young man on a bike, he was college age, a little white dude and very interested in just chatting me up and my back was across to the street. I heard this yelling behind me and I turned around and I see a guy getting out of his car and yelling at the guy behind him and I thought, maybe there's an accident or he was honking his horn or something, and then he got back in his car. I asked kid what was happening and he said, ""no, no"" he said. ""They stopped, the car in the back yelled out, ''Hey, pay your taxes.'' and the guy in the front, went to challenge him saying, ''Hey, these guys pay taxes, they pay every tax, you pay and I'm thinking, wow, there's people are not only supportive at the moment but they're  violently supportive.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	I thought that was really cool, it just began the process of it.Interviewer:	I'm curious what are the other misconceptions that people have about this whole issue? Are there other things that you get when you're out there raising awareness that are like here on the recording [inaudible 00:12:16] like that one I think is a huge one.Kevin Soulless:	There was other two things that I noticed was that people think that you can adjust your status while you're here, and the second, they don't- meaning you don't pay taxes. It's almost impossible to not pay a tax, there's just no way.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	Those are the two that stand out the most, I can probably think of more, but what do you hear? You're closer to the situation.Debbie:	A lot of people tell me why don't you just fix your papers? I'm like if it was as easy as that I would have had them wherever I go. So it is hard and actually I do pay my taxes, they take a toll on me sometimes because it's a lot but it's still okay. But it's hard sometimes you will get rejected a lot of times because of the whole your papers saying and it's, it's just you trying not to let it get to your times but it will. I personally just have noticed that, I just breathe and then relax because I could get out of, I have really bad temper. I try not to let it get out, but sometimes I can't help it.Interviewer:	Is there an example of something like that that just tipped you off?Debbie:	Not recently, but there's been a couple of times where I've gone out with a lot of my friends and most of my friends were born here. There was this one time everybody was going out and everybody showing obviously their IDs, I get up to the guy and I'm like ""here"". So I give him my Mexican ID and he told me, ''You can't come in,'' and I was like why? This is a Mexican ID, and then he told me, ''You just can't we don't accept these things,""  so everybody had to get out and it felt really bad. So that to me, that's one.Kevin Soulless:	I'm just curious, was he Latino himself?Debbie:	Actually he was African American.Kevin Soulless:	Is the club where they were serving alcohol?Debbie:	Yeah. But, I always have my passport either way, but still you always have to carry ID like at certain spots. It's bad, you want to open credit then you can't, because you just can't. This little things here and there that obviously a lot of people don't, it's not seen and I put out there.Kevin Soulless:	I recall one instance when my daughter was [00:15:00] going to college, she is in her first year of college, so she's like around your guys' age. We were getting her an Apple MacBook or whatever for college, and they had a promo, you get a MacBook and you get a free iTouch and I said ""okay"". But the way they did it, they gave it like a rebate, so you pay, but then they give you the money back and they needed her ID to process this. I was just very involved with the movement, and I ask people, what would you do if someone didn't have an ID? I could tell the question never came up because he said, ''We take California ID, we take something else,'' but I can just tell it wasn't an issue. So then I became conscious, how many times you're asked for an ID, and I shared this with another dreamer who I'd met.Interviewer:	Take your time.Kevin Soulless:	He wrote back and he said, ''You don't understand the humiliation we feel, we can't produce ID,'' and I thought how awful is that, just because you don't have this. When I saw that I thought man something's got to be done about that, I'm always conscious now, about how IDs are used for and asked for. It's just hard enough to go and grow up and go to college, and then all of a sudden you've got this thrown at you everyday.Debbie:	Yeah, its hard but you got to keep at it. It's okay, it's hard.Kevin Soulless:	You got used to it?Debbie:	Yes, I got used to it. I actually had one of my ex-boyfriends, we used to talk about it, like a lot and I will always take note and tell him, how I wish I had my papers because it would make it so easy, I'm sorry.Interviewer:	No, take your time, it's fineDebbie:	I'm like it would be so easy. I could go to school, get some financial aid or a loan or something, it would be so easy and he would tell me he'd be like ""you could do everything without your papers"" and I would look at him, I would just laugh of anger. You don't understand, you're born here, you have everything given to you, it's given to you in your hands if you want it you just take it. I on the other hand, I have to work really really hard for it, and if I don't make it, it's going to hurt even worse. He would always tell me ""you can do it, just because you don't have your papers you just putting obstacles in your way"", and I would get so mad because I would tell him I'm not putting an obstacle on my way, it's been placed there for a reason. He will see me all time working in  horrible jobs, trying to get little gigs here and there so I could pay for a book or a class and I would get really sad when I wouldn't pass. He was the total opposite of me that is why we're not together anymore, but it can get hard when people are like ""you could do it you just putting obstacles in your way"" and it's like you probably can, but it's going to take a lot of you.Interviewer:	So you're going to community college, that time and working to be able to pay for classes and stuff?Debbie:	Yes.Interviewer:	What kind of work did you do?Debbie:	It's a long list.Interviewer:	I bet.Debbie:	I was a surfing instructor for summer. That was the best job ever.Interviewer:	That's awesome.Debbie:	Yeah. Unfortunately, I didn't get paid, but it was a great experience. I was a receptionist for a while, I thought it was a really cool job. I was a canvasser and I used to hate that job cause I was on the sun everyday passing off flyers, and I've worked at Subway which is horrible. I worked at a deli, that's horrible too but not as bad as Subway. Yeah exactly.Interviewer:	You do not eat there anymore?Debbie:	It took me two years not to eat there. [00:20:00] Now its slowly but still it's like I try to keep my distance. What else have I done? I've been involved in my community trying to do art, trying to be more involved here and there trying to get little gigs that pay, a certain amount of money, not a lot, but something and my list is long. I always try to help people and somehow they see that and they want to help me. So that's always great. Yeah those ones.Kevin Soulless:	Are you still in college?Debbie:	Yes. I just got back into school.Kevin Soulless:	Are you going to still junior college or community college?Debbie:	Yes, because I stopped going to school for two years and so I keep going back like last semester. So it's fresh again so everything's fresh and I'm having a really hard time right now because I don't remember half the stuff I learned two years ago, and so you're let's say writing a paper, I know I passed the class, but I don't remember how to do a paper again. So now, I am hiring a tutor, which is money I really don't have but I have to do this. So I have to hustle on the side, just to get like a mixture of $40 to pay a tutor or something, and as I told my friend, I'll pay you so you could tutor me because this way, I know I have to pass my class because I'm paying double of what I'm supposed to.Kevin Soulless:	That's good.Debbie:	So it's like a motivation for me to really do good and to just help out a friend. I have to.Interviewer:	What are you studying?Debbie:	I want to be an art psychologist and it's something different and I love art, so I don't want to be struggling or a starving artist. So I wanted to make something with art, so art psychology came out and I saw that and I thought it was a great opportunity.Kevin Soulless:	What careers are in that field?Debbie:	Pretty much what I have a sense of is just a basic that they, but I really want to look into it. It's just working with children pretty much. Because I personally know that when I was a child, I couldn't talk to people. I was very shy, very to myself, but I would doodle a lot. I had a really hard time expressing myself through words. so through my drawings, I started picking it up. My mom, she was the one that has always inspired me to paint and be more crafty and creative, and that's where I get it from, 'cause I saw that all my life. That's why I wanted to work with kids where they ask me if they can't talk, they can express their emotions through a piece and then you get your analysis and you study them through that. It's kind of like psychology, but within the arts.Kevin Soulless:	So you'd have to go and get your masters and higher education of that, well.Debbie:	That's going to be a long ride and I'm ready for it.Kevin Soulless:	That's good.Debbie:	How about yourself. What did you major on?Kevin Soulless:	I went to Cal State Dominguez Hills and at the time my major was behavioral sciences and political science, and I had no idea what I was going to do with either. But I was going to five and a half years and I needed to get out because they don't like you hanging around that long. So pick a major and leave.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	So at the time this in the mid eighties, computers were new and I had a lot of computer experience because I did term papers, a lot of them, and so I just ended up in the IT field, Information Technology, because what I do has nothing to do with the movement and it's funny when people ask me what I do. How I get paid is, I'm an IT project manager. So basically our company sells computer solutions and I oversee the engineers that install it and stuff. The joke I have is because community activism pays so well. Which is like it doesn't pay.Debbie:	ExactlyKevin Soulless:	[00:25:00] Like I said, I came to this movement late, late in my life, late in the movement but I really like it. Whenever I talk to people about what I do, I rarely talk about my work. I'll talk about you guys and what they do, and I have developed a loose association of allies throughout the nation, people closer to my age. We get together and we talk and we like to brag about you guys in Arizona, they're doing this over in Arizona. Well, they're doing this over here and in Utah. They're doing this and so and so got himself arrested and you're like, what? He wasn't supposed to be arrested!Debbie:	That is crazy.Interviewer:	I was just thinking, with your daughter who should've been in college and learning about it through her and these are college age kids. Does it for you have to do with having kids and having kids who are that age, is it connected to that at all?Kevin Soulless:	I always knew growing up that I deal really well with adolescents and I don't know how much a coincidence is, that my kids are of adolescent age. My son is a junior in high school, my daughter, it's her first year in college, but I guess just the timing of this anti-immigration movement, their age, my own interest in seeing something done about it, is just I guess a happy coincidence because I do meet the kids a lot and you'll meet them eventually cause I bring them around. We kind of have a joke because when they do come around, it tends to be a social event, usually at Nancy's house or somebody, and so the other dreamers tease my kids and say, ""This is what your father really does. He just parties with college age kids. We don't really meet or anything. "" So they have that thing, but they've been with me on some of the events and some of the rallies and my son has his little dream-act button and stuff. My daughter goes to Marymount College and it's a two-year college, and the two-year colleges are a little harder to organize around because the students come and go real quickly. So there is a, Hispanic club there and I keep in touch with the director and just let her know what's going on in case the kids are interested but a lot of times I've discovered that outside the movement, there just isn't a lot of knowledge or a lot of movement. If you contrast this with the hippie movement of the '60s, it was an entire youth movement.Debbie:	Yes. Big thing.Kevin Soulless:	Although I see the same parallels, you guys are just a such smaller thing. So it's always funny to be so involved with you, and then yet to talk to somebody the next day who has no idea, and they're like, ""I thought that thing passed."" But no.Debbie:	No, it hasn't yet. I have this conversation with my boss actually all the time. I will be talking and he'll be like, ""You need your papers,"" and I am like, ""If it were that easy, I wouldn't be working with you."" Then he'll just look at me look and he's like, ""I know, right? I'm like, ""Yes."" I just got a tap on my back like, ""Oh my God.""Kevin Soulless:	You have no idea.Debbie:	Because he'll see me out of nowhere and he'll be like, ""You have this, you have that,"" and I have a tendency of bursting his bubble because he has big dreams for me and I'm so limited to what I could do, and then you could tell on his face that he gets frustrated with me just because of that. But it's, like, I can't do anything. The other day we were talking and out of nowhere he was like, ""For some odd reason, I trust you."" I'm like, ""Why shouldn't you trust me?"" He's like he's Arabic, so they don't trust a lot of people outside of their family or whatever, and I'm the one that he trusts. He's had employees there for years and he doesn't trust them, and I've only worked with him for three years.Kevin Soulless:	That's a long time.Debbie:	Yeah, but compared to the guy who's been there for 10. So it's interesting.Kevin Soulless:	That's good.Debbie:	Yeah.Interviewer:	What kind of work is it?Debbie:	I'm working at a laundry slot right now. I was working at the Deli and then he moved me.Interviewer:	Okay. It's his business?Debbie:	It's his own personal business. So it's interesting. I think he wants me to go to a bigger slot in a bigger place, but again, he's so limited [00:30:00] to how he could help me.Kevin Soulless:	I noticed that one time. I don't know if you've met Nancy Messi yet, the short Nancy.Debbie:	Who has short hair?Kevin Soulless:	Yeah.Debbie:	Yeah.Kevin Soulless:	She's real cute because whenever we put her behind a podium, she always hides and we joke that we need to include a stool in our press kits so she would stand on it. But she said something a while ago. We were talking about guidance counselors, excuse me, in high school, and she said, ""The guidance counselors need to stop feeding you this bullshit, that you can become anything."" That's so fascinating to me because you identify with that and I don't get it.Debbie:	Excuse me. They'll tell you, you could do this, you could do that and they can become anything you want. Yes, it sounds all great and dandy, but when you really look at the picture, it's going to take you a long time if you really want to do that. Let's be more realistic. It hits you sometimes like, ""Well, it's either going to take me forever to do that or is it really worth it?"" Because it's going to take either a lot of time or a lot of money, which money most of the time we don't have and time, are you really going to spend that much? Are you really going to go through with whatever you want?Kevin Soulless:	We do a lot of outreach to-- well I'm on the education outreach committee, so we speak to high schools and other things. We do have a presentation just for guidance counselors on working with undocumented youth and I don't know how to fit in the word, don't be feeding them bullshit they can become anything, but that's something we can definitely include, especially since you so readily picked up on that. But we had an interesting, I guess, meeting, but the State-wide conference of the California Dream Act, that was put on by a State representative, Gil Cedillo. Did you get a chance to go to that?Debbie:	No, I didn't.Kevin Soulless:	We did our presentation on AB 540 to high schools, and the first person that spoke, she was from Florida College, and her and her friends at a presentation geared towards the students, and then afterward, I spoke to the counselors. It was a little bit different presentation geared towards them, how to help them with the affidavits and all that. She jokingly referred to me as the expert. She said, ""Okay. Now, We're going to have Kevin speak and he's the expert in this."" I thought ""Okay. That's cute."" So we did our thing. Then at the next session, so many people were coming up to us and asking us information that she said to me, ""I can't believe how many people don't know this information,"" and these are teachers, counselors, people that should know. She says, ""Wow, I guess we really are the experts."" She goes, ""I'm just a kid."" I think she might be younger than you. She says, ""I'm just a student."" That's what she said to me, you're all kids. She said, ""I'm just a student and I'm telling people this,"" and I thought, you know what? Who else knows this?Debbie:	Not a lot of people.Kevin Soulless:	No. So I was like, ""Oh my gosh."" You would hope there'd be somebody more knowledgeable than us.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	But they're not. So this movement is entirely your movement. I'm impressed by how much you guys are in charge of it. You take ownership for it. You were already organized when I met you guys. I really don't do much around here. I show up and I eat and go to parties. You guys like to say that you're undocumented and unafraid, I say I'm documented and afraid because I don't want to be arrested.Debbie:	Oh, I know.Kevin Soulless:	I'm like, ""No, that's all you."" If anything is going to happen, if there's any form of immigration reform, it's going to be led by you. You guys are the experts and it probably be one good policy area for you to join and get to tell your story. We find that when, particularly, you dreamers talk to high school and you come out so boldly being undocumented, we'll have kids hang around afterwards and talk. We have a few people from high school attending the meetings just because of the events we've done. That's, I think, really empowering that they see you standing up.Debbie:	I remember when I used to go to those meetings and be like, ""Oh my God,"" like, ""Those guys are crazy. They're cool."" Then I'll be the student teaching other people about the Dream Act and all that stuff. Everything in that place where I'll get mad. Once I really [00:35:00] got mad with one of my classmates. For me to lose my temper, it's really hard. She was being very arrogant of the sense that she was just going off about immigrant students, they shouldn't be in school, and I was just sitting there and I was just holding it in, just taking everything in. Then she said a comment. She said, ""Yeah, I'm Mexican. I was born there, but I am not a web egg,"" or something like that. That hit me. I got up and I think I made her cry because I was so mad. I was like, ""Well, you're from Mexico. You were born there. You're an immigrant and you're saying you're just going against everything you are,"" and I don't even remember what I told her. But point is, I got so mad. My friends, they'd never seen me mad and they were like, ""Really? Are you serious?"" I just got my stuff and left. Til this day, I haven't talked to that girl. I usually don't get mad to people and I try to talk to them and make them understand that there's other stuff and wise. I'm trying to teach them something, and this girl was just not having it.Kevin Soulless:	Was she documented?Debbie:	She was undocumented.Kevin Soulless:	She was undocumented.Debbie:	Yeah.Kevin Soulless:	Okay. That's weird.Debbie:	Exactly. I was like, ""Wait, you're undocumented, you should be standing here with me and not arguing with me.""Kevin Soulless:	One thing I noticed is that the ones who are documented, like who would be in her situation, but documented, they tend to be the ones that have that opinion that she has, that, ""You guys. You, ones who didn't come over properly."" You're going to discover there's three people in this movement. There's allies, there's opponents, and then there's a third category, which are neither. They just like the debate.Debbie:	They're just there hanging around.Kevin Soulless:	Yeah, they're just there and they tend to suck your energy. So personally, I avoid those people. I can deal easier with an opponent than I can with somebody that just flips on the conversation and like, ""Okay. You're neither."" Because at least I know where the opponent's going to be. They'll be right outside our rally and I don't know where these others are going to be.Debbie:	They're all over the place.Kevin Soulless:	I know.Debbie:	It's true.Kevin Soulless:	But we work with the allies. We're starting to win over the opponents because as the debate goes on, what's it now? Like three, four years now, maybe even longer. All their lies, all the things they've said are just not true.Debbie:	Exactly.Kevin Soulless:	More and more people are realizing, ""Wait a minute, they do pay taxes. Wait a minute, because they get ITIN numbers, they are funding social security."" ""Wait a minute, guess what? White people don't want to pick agriculture."" So everything is just they are false and more people are realizing that, ""Okay. We should do something about this and get these people involved to help our economy.""Debbie:	Just like they have a stereotype unlike the other communities that, ""You came here illegally. You only come to steal your jobs and you're horrible to society. You're taking everything."" Then you see a person like me and you're like, ""Really?"" Really, she doesn't look like she's going to rob me, or mug me or anything. I'm like, ""Nope, I just want an education and I want a better job. I want to have my family at some point."" That stereotype, I guess, is little by little fading away in a sense which is really good.Kevin Soulless:	I know. I don't know anyone that fits the stereotype they have. What I like to joke is that, ""Yeah, they are coming across the border because they want to wash your cars and babysit your children."" I'm like, ""Oh, and by the way, they also want to take care of you in your old age.""Debbie:	That's pretty much true.Kevin Soulless:	So I think it's going to be in your favor, and I hope it's sooner than later just because eventually it's going to.Debbie:	It's going to happen.Kevin Soulless:	Just the numbers.Debbie:	It's going to happen, hopefully soon as you said.Kevin Soulless:	Okay. Great.Debbie:	Thank you.Kevin Soulless:	Thank you. Nice meeting you.Debbie:	Nice meeting you, too. That was so great.",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
MBY007997,"EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	[00:00:00] My name is EmeryI Griffin Louise. I'm 27 years old, we are in Lihue Hawaii, and It's June 16th, 2011, and I'm sitting with my mother, Pat Griffin.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	I am Pat Griffin, actually Patricia Louise Griffin, and I'm privileged to be your mother. It is in fact June 16th, and we are in Lihue, the heart of Kauai. I'm delighted to be here with you, and that you really encouraged me to make the phone call to do so. Thanks a lot because we have so much fun listening to story call together around what your block early in the morning. It's a great opportunity to do this.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Every morning we have a chance to meet up and talk, listen to the news between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning when it's still dark. There's nothing better to do than talk. First off, I just want to say how thankful and privileged I am to be able to have a conversation with you every morning, and that's something that I really value about our relationship. It's something that I don't think a lot of people have with their parents that close and an ongoing conversation.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Me to I think both your dad and I feel very grateful that our two children want to be seem to like to be with us and we don't take that for granted.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	That's good because I still enjoy living at home.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah. Well, if he were up to me alone, you wouldn't be, but your dad says, well, you won't have you forever and you do pay rent.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	I do pay rent, and I know that when I'm gone for long periods you do miss me, and particularly around the butcher block in the morning because dad doesn't get up at that time.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah, and the news in the evening, the night you come home.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Who's going to talk about the ties with?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	It's right.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	One thing that we really wanted to go over was some of the family history because as we all age, a lot of these stories and traditions inevitably get lost. You hold the connection to our grandparents in ways that I might not have another chance to talk about. Anywhere you want to start?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, we can start there. You want to know about you granny and Grandpa Jack?EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Well, why don't we start with you as a kid. You can either talk about them or your experiences or what.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Okay. Well, I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida and both of my parents were too, but they came from really different worlds. Granny, aka [inaudible 00:03:44] Santana Griffin came from a working class Spanish background family. Her mother was born in in Tampa and her grandmother, my Abuela Amparo, was actually born in Key West. Her father had been in New Orleans, was a musician. They went to Key West and he also rolled cigars and that's what the family did. I went on bottle my great grandmother was still a baby when they came to Tampa. There was really a thriving Latin community in Tampa, we talk about Ybor City, which is still there, but Tampa heights, West Tampa. The people who had come from Spain had different traditions, or clubs and things based on the part of Spain where they were from. Our family was from a studious Spain. They-- a club that my Abuela and Abuelo, where part of what's called [inaudible 00:04:49]. I think my grandmother really identified with that. She acted it was onstage a lot, and I actually have a picture too of her [00:05:00] with that. My grandfather, my Abuelo , would go down to the men's section lot and play peanut full and dominoes and things, but it was really a life asked there was alive with the cigar factories themselves. You saw when we were in Tampa last month, how cigar factories were built on that East-West axis to take advantage of the sun. All of the workers would put money together and higher lecturer to read some of the classics and so forth. At the same time, it was a very hierarchical community in those days, and they were definitely working class and being Latino's. There were signs on the beaches, no Cubans allowed, so there were restrictions that I think these days people don't really know about. Now, grandpa Jack's family, he was also born in Tampa and his father had been from Central Florida. He had come to Tampa's as a young man in the 1890s and was a banker. They were very privileged. They happen to meet when your grandpa Jack went off to war and his daddy was the head of the bank. He got your grandmother and my mother, to mail things to daddy. That's really how they met, but when they decided to get married, daddy was the youngest of seven. The brothers who was so unheard of for him to marry a little Latin girl that they had a big conference about that. I grew up really in two worlds in a way that most of my friends didn't. On Sundays, our Sunday dinner was at granddaddy's house, and there was actually oriental carpet on the floor of the dining room and there was a button that would be pushed under it and servants would bring in the courses. Then I go to my Abuela and Abuelo's house and we would have arroz con pollo or my Abuelo was a wonderful cook and we'd go to West Tampa, and get pollitos, and tamales, and have this whole other cuisine, and granddaddy's house was three floors with a ballroom on the third floor. And Abuela and Abuelo's house was a little house in West Tampa on Water Street. He would still have fun there. We would get behind the door, and take the front door in front of his behind it and play elevator, and go up and down.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	They have an elevator in there?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yes. granddaddy's house had an elevator in my Abuelo never drove, Abuela did, but we would take the bus downtown to to Woolworths on Saturdays and he'd buy us little trinkets, and then we'd sit at the lunch counter there at the time. Abuela and your Aunt Marcia would have a Coke and I'd have a root beer. The worlds were very different.FEMALE_1:	How aware that was you as a child?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	I was aware of it because they really weren't worlds that met a lot, and my mother never rejected her upbringing or anything, but she didn't go to college. There's this misconception that all parents want their kids to go to college. I think some cultures, that sense of being together as a family is really important. Abuela and Abuelo expected her to grow up and then go to the cigar factory and work with them and so forth and she didn't. She worked at the bank, but she really wanted to go to college. But with my friends, you know brownies girl scouts, their parents, their mothers had all gone to college and they had known each other as kids. They'd seeing their parents sorority songs and so forth, and we were out of that a little bit.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	So most of your friends were white?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah, there is a tendency to show the high school, we went to the schools, it's part of where our house was. While there wasn't conscious [00:10:00] segregation between my two worlds that there was defactor distance between the two.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	What do you think that you really learned from grams in that situation?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, I didn't learn enough Spanish. I'll tell you that. I learned about her and some of the difficulties she had trying to move into this other world. She used to talk about how daddy's siblings didn't particularly accept her, but my granddaddy, the head of the bank did always accepted her. She also was pretty independent. They lived at grandma's house for a little while and she was willing to live in a shack rather than having-- because they would come in with coat and ties to dinner, and it was a very formal place. I think I've picked that up from her. Did you ever feel any of that when we visit Tampa?EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Well, I mean, we're always more formal when we go to Florida. We say here, ""If it's a formal occasion, you put on your dress slippers."" So I did feel that but I think I was a little young because even grandpa Jack, there's not a lot that I remember from him. I remember Smokey the Cat and that's basically it. Even visiting my cousin Nancy for her wedding last month in Florida and trying to piece our stories and our understanding of our family together. I grew up here in Hawaii with the family over there and so there's a lot of that I just don't know or connect with. It is this whole other world that I don't think that Arthur and I are really too familiar with and so it does feel very strange to go over there. Even Grams and grandpa Jack, they weren't people that we knew their life story or the little things. I can think of Grams singing in the car and all that but not having that same understanding as Nancy or Christie who grew up with them.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah, she really pretty much raised them. Both of your cousins they're Nancy and Christie, have married boys whose great grandparents were friends of your great grandparents and their great grandparents. So that closeness and that tradition is really still there. One of the things, I know we talked a little bit before we came in today about traditions, and what kind of traditions you would like be pass down and what ones we had. One of the hardest things for me here is, that lack of family and lack of tradition when your dad's folks want you to [inaudible 00:14:08] grandpa say were alive, we would have holidays with them but now it's just the four of us. There aren't big meals and getting together, and having Sunday dinners or Christmas Day, the bigger broader groups and all of my family lived there in one place and that's really hard. In some ways we're probably more a representative of a lot of America today having been mobile in a way and ended up. You grew up here, how do you feel about being from Hawaii?EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Well, it's always a good conversation starter. Lots of [00:15:00] people don't even think that people live in Hawaii, but it is really interesting living in a place where, talk about being bullied and people will say, ""Oh, was it because you're gay?"" or anything like that. ""No, is because I was white."" That was really interesting and having the culture here, this conglomeration of various cultures, and going to the east coast and being very, very taken aback when people asked, ""What is the weirdest thing?"" They all laughed when I said, ""Well, there's a whole lot of white people here."" Being really taken aback. This is in a sense my culture or the race that I'm a part of but not associating so much with that. In Massachusetts, things are just so different culturally. It's hard because there are so many different cultures in Hawaii. With what I do, I work in conservation, I work to preserve and protect endangered species, primarily plants and I am dedicated to this place. I think I definitely got a lot of that through you and my dad. This drive to give back to this place that I'm from, to be a part of the community. But, I mean, I don't know, I think it's hard for anybody to talk about their culture, where they're from, I mean, it's just normal.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask you a question?EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	You said you talk sometimes about having been bullied here not because you're gay but because you're white. I bet you've heard a little bit about it Patt, but could you just remind your mom what you're talking about?EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Yeah, particularly in fifth and sixth grade, but some in kindergarten, the public schools. I know my brother went through some of this too but feeling just this tension, and thankfully on the bus ride to King Kaumuali'i School, I had the bully who I played soccer with. He would sit in the row in front of me and he had my back. The bus was the safe spot. He made it clear that nobody was to mess with me. I was always so thankful because as soon as I got off the bus, kids would be teasing me or spit on me and they would try to stab me with the pencils. It was it was mainly one kid and then his group around him who really had that kind of hate for white people and I was lippy and not ashamed. I saw no reason to be ashamed of something that I couldn't really control and so I would talk back, ""Yes, I'm white. What do you want me to do about that? This is not going to change. What is your problem and where do we go from here?"" which ended up with it escalating and I don't think the lesson was really learned on their part. But for me, I'd left one without very much white guilt seeing how stupid it is. We all go through rough experiences and why should I not acknowledged that this is an experience that we have whether you're brown, or black, or white, or yellow, or whatever it is. Being in Hawaii that's nice because we do make fun of each other, we can poke at other races in ways that it's still taboo on the mainland. We can bring these things up without it being aggressive or condescending in the same way. I mean, I feel the same way to some extent. You are very protective of [00:20:00] me and Arthur, my brother, and you want the best for us and you want us to be happy. One thing that we don't talk too much about is the fact that I'm gay and is this issue that I know you accept and I know you love me regardless of anything, really. Here's this thing that you want me to be so protected that in a sense you want to not hide but not bring up. To shelter me, let's not bring this up. That was another hard thing for me. Growing up was, ""Where are my role models? Who do I have to look at?"" Being on a rural island, there was nobody.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah, that's often hard although I think that maybe I did try and you weren't ready to talk about it. There's something else too, which is that you are a grown up. To just give you an analogy, I mentioned to Arthur a year or two ago when he was still in California, I said, ""Just because I don't ask you about your love life or if you have a girlfriend or what you're doing, it's not that I'm not interested, I just think it's your business until you're ready to make it mine."" So I feel personal things are something that the person needs to give permission to bring up. But for a long time, I don't know the exact percentages now, but we're about 30 here on this island, about 30 percent Haole, and 30 percent Filipino, and 30 percent Japanese, and Hawaiians and mixed Hawaiians, and some others in there. I thought that it wasn't the worst thing in the world for you all to feel like a minority at points. I looked at Arthur, he was always the biggest kid in his class and sometimes just about the youngest mostly. His three best friends were Paul another Haole and Mike, Filipino and Shane, Japanese-Thai. They would go around and and yet still I know there's that element and it's still there and bullying under any excuse is something that we all need to put behind us.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Any questions for me?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, I think that one of the real life changing events that you had was at Vermont wilderness. I have brought home a lot of possibilities of camps for you too, you wanted to go camping and you so different, and you both chose very different ones. I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about your experiences in Vermont?EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Yes. As you mentioned, I went to summer camp in Vermont. I would spend pretty much my entire summer, two months out in the wilderness. This was a very free, very liberal camp where we had no electricity and no running water, and we would cook and have light from fire and we would pump our water every day, and it was a really fantastic experience. I think that is one of the many ways that you guys really pushed us to be who we are, and pushed us along in our own development. Here's one area that it was very pleasant struggle just to make the day go by. All of our food was hiked [00:25:00] and that was incredible. Just seeing so many kids was incredible.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	So many naked kids.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	We had the freedom to wear whatever we wanted or lack thereof, so long as there weren't knives, fire, or excessive coats. If it was too cold and they wanted us to wear clothes, they would make sure we are properly clothed, then if not, we wouldn't be fed. Even the rules were pretty lax, and we all got hungry enough to where we put on that sweater for dinner. That was really incredible, and just seeing that support.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	There's been, a joke about it, but to be a flying cloud, you were supposed to be 11, and you weren't quite 11 yet, but they made an exception. That's the way you've been all your life really. Arthur was three weeks late being born. He was just hanging around in there almost nine pounds when he was born, went through high school, decided to wait a year before going to college, and you were three weeks early and six and a half pounds. Then you went to camp early, and then you skipped 11th and 12th grade and went to college early. You started growing orchids at 11, and you new what you're doing. I laugh about that, you two are so different in so many ways, and that's one that I've been amused about all of your lives.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Most things in your life seem pretty planned, and I would expect that having children was part of that. Was Arthur, who's three years older than me, was he planned?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yes. Your dad and I knew each other for seven years before we got married. I was 31 when I got married, and we were happy to see Arthur come along. I got pregnant just a very short while after my best friend had died, and was really in deep mourning. She and I had a connection that was beyond words, and Arthur really was a joy to wait for and to have born. Then I was 35 when you were born two years and nine months later, and you also were planned. We wanted both of you and welcomed you, and there wasn't a whole lot of surprise, and either accept that Arthur had gotten into some resin catalyst that he had found next to the surfboard, and you weren't due, like I said for three weeks. He ended up in the hospital and I fell trying to find him, and both of you, bull-headed kids were a breach, I had two C-sections. I was on one floor delivering you, and your dad and Arthur were up and the other floor of the hospital. Your dad was running back and fourth between us. So I can't say that was exactly planned, but we had hoped to get into our house before you came, but you threw a monkey wrench into that one.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Were we what you, not expected, but was raising kids, particularly my brother and I being the auditors that we are. Was that part of the play? Did that fit your expectations?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	I don't know what expectations I really had when you were growing up and people [00:30:00] would say, you are weird, I would say the only appropriate answer is?EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Take that as a compliment.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Thank you. I was happy to have you. I'd like to think it wasn't just because it was something we were supposed to do, and you all fought a lot. That was really difficult, I don't think I handled that very well.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Well, out of all of our family, I think we get along pretty much the best out of any siblings that we see now.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	I guess if you weren't able to kill each other, you might as well get along.EMIRYL GRIFFIN LOUISE:	It only made us stronger.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask you a question real quick about something that you mentioned a while ago. You mentioned that you had a best friend that you were really very close to. What's her name?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Her name is Becca Carl Smith.FEMALE_1:	Is there anything you want to tell Emerie about her, what kind of person was she?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, I've talked about her. She was a dancer and an artist. When she moved here with her husband, she had already had about with melanoma. She came, and they had a child and Ken decided he was gay and had moved over to another island. Malia was here and Beca was going back and fourth for treatment. So your dad and I just married. He took care of Malia for quite a while, but when Malia was born, she was born on the 200th anniversary of Captain Cook's arrival. I was driving to this celebration, and I didn't known that Beca was in labor. I literally had to pull over. I just suddenly got so emotional. I had to pull over and I started crying and later that night I found out that that was when Beca had given birth. Her cancer came back, obviously, and that period was difficult because of the complications with her husband choosing another way of life, and having her daughter here and knowing that she wasn't going to be able to seen her daughter grow up. Malia was 22 months old when Beca died, and then she went to live with Ken. But she's somebody I'll take with me forever. She was 34 when she died.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Do you think that shaped your relationship with us growing up, or having a friend who did pass and having an opportunity then to connect with there children?PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	She gave me a wonderful lesson, cause I went with her at one point to her home in Philadelphia to take her to her mom's there for some treatment and stuff, and when I learned until the very last month when tumors were everywhere in your body, and when was in her brain, and she could heard everything and understand, but she couldn't talk. But she wasn't dying for that nine months we were together. We were living together. She knew the breath of her life, but most of the time we had fun. We had fun in Philadelphia. We talked about really difficult things, but I learned that people aren't just dying at the end, that they're still living. I've kept that with me for all of these years since. I wanted to mention to you two when I was asking about farm and wilderness, but there was also assets. I made a lot of mistakes as a mum, I know, but I think I tried to teach you too much and fight for you, things that you deserved too much and didn't always just know how to relax and just love you, and figure out ways to what you really wanted. But when it was clear that the schools here weren't giving you what you deserved, being so gifted, both of you, we send you to school in Honolulu. We would put you on the plain in the [00:35:00] morning and pick you up in the afternoon and that was a real article of faith, because once you were there, especially when you all started walking from the airport to school in Honolulu, on Nimitz highway and coming back. But you remembered that you are in school as your best certainly before college.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	That was really fun. People wanted to learn, and people didn't think I was weird for the way that I learned, and the way that I understood things, or the fact that I wanted to learn and understand things, and that was really fun. One thing that I've always had frustrations with is, at the hurricane, everything shut down and I was sent to Oahu to live with another family, and I always felt, and this is totally illogical and I see the sense in it. But I always felt like I was being sent away and being pampered while I could rough it too. To have that experience on quiet and rough it with my family, drink the water out of the water trucks that would come by, and eat the MRE's that the soldiers were given. I could do that too, but I felt often like the weaker of the siblings and it's so funny because logically, I was the one who made more sense to go to school. It's always been something that I've held onto. But one thing that I see in you is, you have fought for us so often and you do feel so guilty about the missteps that you've made, and yet it's so clear to see how much you loved Arthur and I, and how much you did fight for us constantly, to give us a step up and to protect us, and to make sure we would have a wonderful life. It pains us too to think that you're selling yourself short, because you are such a wonderful mum, and you do care so much and in some ways we are your children, you love us forever, but you hold your own shortcomings so much against yourself, and that's hard.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, mothers are paid to feel guilty.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	It's not said often enough, but I love you, and Arthur and I love you, and our family loves you. We're all inspired by what you do. Now I know that I'm a detail oriented perfectionists over achiever from you.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Yeah. Well, put in a good word for your dad too. He has been a rock in all of our lives. His humor and dedication to the family. I came over, as you know, I had no interest in coming to Hawaii. I'd done sand and palm trees and I knew I was a good friend of his sister, and I new his mother before I ever met him, and he walked in, when he had taken off from Stanford and took that leave of absence and I remember very clearly where I was sitting, the day I met him, but I still took me four years to get out here, and only then because he sent me a Valentine's Day ticket to come out, and I watched here and realize it's worth moving halfway around the world for somebody you love. We have been together, and I hope that that's a lesson that we also have been able to transmit. That loving somebody, being together, and giving that commitment share as a lesson has been important for us to you.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	You have raised a very non-traditional family with a tattoo artists, an artists and scientists. Our nuclear family, and yet growing up with dinners around the dinner table every single night, and candles lit, and the way that Arthur and I look at relationships and commitments is traditional in ways that you don't see, and yet each individual, [00:40:00] I think it's so non-conformist, and I'm just delighted by our family and the relationships that we have with one another.PATRICIA LOUISE GRIFFIN:	Well, me too, and thanks for bringing me here today to share this together.EMERY GRIFFIN LOUISE:	Well, I'm glad that we did it.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
MBY008012,"Lonnie Lugo:	[00:00:00] Aloha, my name is Lonnie Lugo. I'm 65 years old. Today is June 18th, 2011 and I'm in Lihue, Hawaii, and I will be talking with my husband, Juan.Juan Lugo:	That would be me, I'm the husband. My name is Juan Lugo, and I am also 65 years of age, and today's date is doing the 18th, 2011 and we are on the beautiful island of Kawaihae in Lihue, Hawaii, and this is my wonderful wife of 44 years. Well, was wonderful until I got her to do this.Lonnie Lugo:	Very well stated.Juan Lugo:	So just basically.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, would you tell us a little bit about yourself, Juan?Juan Lugo:	No. I choose to remain silent. No. Basically, I was born on the island of Kawaihae, born and raised here, or at least I thought I was. It wasn't until I joined the military that after I graduated from high school and I was slated to work in the YouTube and also nominated to become an officer. So they did a very extensive background check because in those days the YouTube was still considered quite top-secret. After they finished, they approached me and they said according to what they had discovered that the name on my birth certificate read as Juan. I was certain they had made a mistake and so I told them, and this was long before puns were big, I told them they have the wrong Juan. Well, they didn't think it was so comical and so I've discovered very soon that the military does not like to make mistakes, and I was 18 years old, and I did not like to admit that I was wrong, the world was wrong, I was right. So therefore, I told them they should call my parents, they'll resolve this and they said no because of the security clearance that they would have to come back to the island of Kawaihae, which we did. Once we had all gathered, my father stunned me by saying, ""Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you something, Juan."" That's when I discovered that, that was the name, I now looked at my parents as if they were strangers because the tauntings of my siblings came back to haunt me in that they would make statements such as, I really wasn't their brother, that they had found me in the pineapple fields or in the sugar cane fields. I used to laugh it off thinking that's just siblings, but now there was a certain truth to this, there was a certain pain, and I looked at those what I called my parents, I looked at them as strangers and the two officers at the presence if mind of leaving us alone, so they left us the story unfolded.Lonnie Lugo:	By what name did you grow up with?Juan Lugo:	Keoni, that was the name that was on all my documents and licenses and everything. But when I found out that I had been named after my Tutukani, my grandfather, and this is a man that I loved, I absolutely worshiped, I don't think it would be too strong of a word. When I found out that I had been named after him, I was filled with such a pride, such a joy that now when I was asked by the military if I wanted to legally change my name to Keoni I said no, I wanted to keep the name that I was given in honor of this wonderful man and as you've heard me brag so many times of the fact that I have carried on this name, I was the only one that was given the name Juan of all my siblings, and which drives you crazy when it comes to our children.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, especially since you always have to add that your parents were too poor to give you a second name or a middle name, so you're just plain old Juan Lugo.Juan Lugo:	Exactly. Very, very plain. Nothing, eight letters, it's easy to remember, easy to write.Lonnie Lugo:	So can I ask a question?Juan Lugo:	Yes.Lonnie Lugo:	Why didn't your parents tell you your given name was Juan?Juan Lugo:	It really wasn't of import... Here on the islands, it's one where no one really questioned why or what you did, it was just a way of life, you would just hear the [00:05:00] legacy of the sugarcane industry that had brought together such a diverse group of people from all over the world so, we just considered all of us as poise, as mixtures, and never really thought anything of it.Lonnie Lugo:	Not only that, but after seven kids who can remember such little details?Juan Lugo:	There were nine, thank you very much, I was a seventh son.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, yes.Juan Lugo:	So there is a little bit of a difference there.Lonnie Lugo:	All right. Well, your name is so easy to remember, and for me to remember and of course I always remembered your social security number, I think I've finally memorized my own but it was always about you. So tell me what you did when you were growing up?Juan Lugo:	What did I do? I played, I thought that this island was the world, I did not know that there was a larger world. There wasn't a lot of media, radios, not everybody had television so therefore, a lot of time was spent on the outdoors, the beaches, listen to stories and the stories that my Tutukani, my parents would tell they were just incredible stories and I think that's one of the reasons that I really, I'm enjoying this is that I would love to have been able to hear the voice of my grandfather as he talks, as he told the stories and the advice that he gave me. So I guess I'm doing this for my very own grandchildren also, and that's why I'm glad that you're a part of this and still not angry at me.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, I would like for you to tell me and remind me of why you're so working part-time and what do you do in your spare time? What you'd like to tell the people you work with?Juan Lugo:	I'm working because you're a kept woman, that's why. You make me go out and work, no, no. It's a job that I enjoy doing and it is giving tours, and so if this allows me to share the beauty, the magic that is the island of Kawaihae and also when I'm not doing the tours I am in my studios doing my art and what makes it so wonderful as a fact, well now that you're retired too, that we can spend all our time together and we'll both have all this innovation. But the stories also that I share with our guest are stories that were passed on to me by my family. So these are the stories that I really enjoy sharing with everybody.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, I know our grand kids are curious about the different stories. If you might mention one, maybe the mongoose, why, where are the mongoose and Kawaihae?Lonnie Lugo:	Let the chicken see them.Juan Lugo:	When the sailing ships were coming to the islands, they brought with them the rat. This rat soon took on a very large population. Different methods were attempted to control this growing rat population. Nothing was proven worthwhile. King Kamehameha I had prohibited the usage of poison, afraid that innocent lives would be lost. So different methods were explored. Nothing was proven successful until they put a rat inside a cage that held a pet mongoose from one of the sailors. The mongoose quickly dispatched the rat, did not eat it. They felt that they had found the perfect solution. The mongoose was introduced to the other islands with nothing untoward occurring. The mongoose that I am referring to hailed from India. In India, it hunts and kills the snakes. It is very fast. It's quite vicious for its size. Rudyard Kipling engaged [inaudible 00:09:30] to one such mongoose when, in his jungle book series, he named it Rikki-tikki-tavi. Disney Studios followed suit by also making a full length cartoon feature film. Well, this was the mongoose that was introduced to the other islands with nothing untoward occurring. When it was going to be introduced to the island of Hawaii, the magic, that is Hawaii, came to the surface, the magic that I'm always telling you about, that you get tired of hearing about. But [00:10:00] the Ali'i went to the white mainland to greet these saviors from the Burgundian rat population. Curious as to what they looked like, he decided to inspect one at close range. No sooner had he done so, he stuck his hand inside a cage that held nine hungry, angry, sea sick mongoose than he was viciously attacked. He finally withdrew a bloody, mauled hand. When he did so, he ordered the nine mongoose to be drowned and forbade the further introduction of anymore mongoose to the island of Hawaii. That little act, insignificant as it would appear to be on the surface, would now have such a far reaching effect because they quickly discovered the error of their way on the other islands. They quickly discovered that the mongoose was diurnal, hunts during the day. The rat is nocturnal, hunts at night, hence they never met, save for the time that the rat was returning from a hard night's foraging, the mongoose was just beginning to start his foraging, so they would greet each other with a very cheerful and resounding ""Aloha! (continue to speak in Hawaiian)."" They spoke Hawaiian, now you know. They went about their merry ways. Well, that's when they also discovered on the other islands, much to their chagrin, that the mongoose was a voracious eater of eggs. It was systematically responsible for wiping out several species of bird life on the other islands, bird life that escaped extinction because of the magic that is Hawaii.Lonnie Lugo:	I've always loved that story and I keep forgetting the details. I guess hearing it so many times just does not compute anymore.Juan Lugo:	So that's why we're recording?Lonnie Lugo:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	May I ask, why do you like that story?Lonnie Lugo:	Because I'm just curious, because our son used to work and live in Maui, and we used to visit and we used to see them over there all the time and crossing the road. I was always so surprised. I loved little, cuddly type animals even though they aren't cuddly. I guess Rikki-tikki-tavi puts the Disney World in my head. I've always just liked that story, which brings me to another story of family life and how you grew up, the Kikaha life. That is my favorite, and of course, since we no longer have the light, but we have a wonderful story.Juan Lugo:	The Kikaha said no light anyway. It depicts how life was here on the islands, how it was a very slow pace, how the most simplest things gave the most magical wonders. This light was one of those things. This was the first light that was put on the island of Hawaii. It was in Kikaha. It was put in place to stop the little traffic that was making its way up or down the canyon, Waimea and Cocky. In those days, the sugarcane used to be hauled in to the mill from the fields by the usage of trains. There were times that the burned embers would be reignited, you would have a raging inferno. So they needed to get back to the mill very quickly so they could extinguish this raging inferno. That was the pragmatic reason, as I was telling our granddaughter the other day. How times have changed, for us to see a light change color in the middle of nowhere was magic at its best. It was incredible. So when my parents would announce that we would be going to Kikaha to watch the Kikaha signal light change color, we would become so excited, so filled with joy, because we would be seeing this magical light change color. Early Saturday morning, we would get all of our chores done and then we would now make our way. But the night before we were talking about all the things that we would be doing, whether it was board surfing, body surfing, fishing, whether it was attempted to swim out to the islands [00:15:00] of Ni'ihau, Lehua, Ka'ula. I don't know if I should really share this because I tell the grand-kids not to do this, but that's what we used to do to purposely get caught and used to think that I was so mental for doing this, but we were young, not smart, but we would look for the rip tides, the undertones, and they would take us out of a hundred, two hundred, three hundred feet. Then after weekend, because as we're going out, we would be swimming, it seemed as if as fast as the fish. After, we would body surf and we would talk about all of those things. Well, Saturday morning we would load all of our camping equipment, which has nothing like today, but we all load everything up in the back of a pickup truck, company equipment, children, everybody, we would make our way. Once we set up camp, we were free to do whatever it was we wanted. But no matter whatever it was we were doing, if we heard the train blow it's whistle, letting us know that it was making it's way back to the mill from the field, we would run as fast as we could, bare foot, sun-shirt, and make it in time to watch the Kikaha signal light change color. I remember jumping up and down, clapping, cheering for scenes. Such an absolutely magical, wonderful sight, I would wave at the engineers. They would wave back, the uncles that were driving and all. I would do this several times during the day into the dark and night, never tiring. That night or those nights I can remember falling asleep, listening to the gentle rhythmic pattern of the waves as they landed upon the beach. I would listen to the gentle strumming of the guitars and the ukuleles listening to the songs. I would join in at times, I would watch the dancing by the campfire light. and the waves crashing upon the shore. They would lure me to sleep. I would look up into the sky and I would see the stars and the moon play hide and seek behind the clouds. I drift off into asleep, but that filled my memory banks with many happy memories. So when life was not so charitable, when it was filled with challenges, challenges that many times you and I experience together, I could make a withdrawal of those happy memories, the Kikaha signal light. Even though it's gone, it's been taken down now for a couple of years, and so even though it's physically gone, it still remains in my heart, in my memories of the gentler type of life.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, I remember how you came in when you found out that it was coming down. Then of course, you have to take us, our grand kids and myself, to go see the light was gone. Well, no, we went, I think, the day before it was going to be taken the down.Juan Lugo:	My friend told me they were going to take it down.Lonnie Lugo:	You took pictures and we have all kinds of pictures of it. Then afterwards we went after they had taken the light out and we also have pictures of that no light.FEMALE_1:	Had you ever heard about those signal light before that day?Lonnie Lugo:	No. I have taken for granted living here. Having lived on the mainland, being always in a rush in the traffic, and my father was in the military, so I moved from place to place. Then moving back here, just accepting life as it was and trying to keep up with one, and his stories and everything, but some things were just never told, because it was just his way of life, not mine.Juan Lugo:	One of the secrets of staying together is never listen to another person's stories when they're being told.Lonnie Lugo:	I love the times with him. Oh, yeah. Sure. Erase that computer.Juan Lugo:	The grand kids, they would be interested in hearing them as she would like, ""Okay, I got something to do, look at the house needs [00:20:00] to be cleaned.""FEMALE_1:	Why was it like that like, go see the signal. I got thinking about, especially for you.Lonnie Lugo:	It was very sad because before that, when we went to Cocky to visit, to take friends, they would come and visit and of course, we always have to take them up the Cocky, it was just one of those things that I just took for granted. It was there, it was always going to be there.Juan Lugo:	It was still it was still operating in the '80s when the burn sugar cane was now being brought in from the fields of by the tractor trailers. So I never thought to that I would see the end of the sugarcane industry. I never thought that this light that brought such magic to me would ever be gone.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, of course not, it's just the sugarcane is just one of those stories.Juan Lugo:	Such an important role.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, yes, it played a very important role, but it's a story that you don't think that there's no more sugar cane as it was. We see it little feels here and there, but nothing. Even with us, we'll buy a pineapple and we'll plant the core or whatever it's called.Juan Lugo:	Crown gardener.Lonnie Lugo:	The crown. Okay.Juan Lugo:	City girl.Lonnie Lugo:	We do. We have grown pineapples, but it's just not the same anymore. I do crafts and I go to the Luau at Kilohana, and I see all these tours, ""Oh is as sugar? Is that a pineapple plant? Are those pineapples?"" Yes. You can see that,"" Oh, I thought they grew on trees."" Or, ""Don't they grow on the ground?"" No, as you see it there, that's the way they grow. But it really saddens me every time I go up there and I see no more light. But I guess life has to go on, changes. But with those changes, I've been hearing right now a lot of talk about the chickens of Kauwai. It's getting me worked up that the local people are starting to complain and move on with the complaints with the tourists. But tell us about the chickens.Juan Lugo:	The chickens play a very, very important role and this is why some of the changes that are happening are that the inability for people to be as resilient as they once were, and the smallest things seem to now affect them. The chickens actually play a very, very important role. There's a breed of chickens here that are found nowhere else in the world and that is the Polynesian junglefowl. It gives a clue as to who these people of Havaer, where did they come from? There's still a lot of conjecture and a lot of theories as to who are these people? Where did they come from? So it has now been determined that all of the chickens in the world had one origin, and that is from Southeast Asia. Whatever chicken that the people have seen or you've seen has originally came from Asia. When the ancients came, they brought with this, they brought within the junglefowl. It is quite unique in that, the ones that the people are complaining about now, and those are the ones that have been used through natural attrition, whether it is the lane or the fighting variety and the ones that are also being picked out. I hope that, I know they're in the process of making them in the endangered Polynesian junglefowl. Because they are unique. Their markings are quite different. In fact we the thing about the Polynesian junglefowl [00:25:00] is it that the hen and the rooster they mate for life. So they have, I've shared responsibility in the raising of this small brooded chips. They adhere to the law of the wild, the law of the jungle. When you see the local boys when they're trying to capture the baby chicks, even when they used to do this, they would always have someone that would be watching that has a security to get to these particular little baby chicks. Their markings are quite unique and before they're completely gone. Yes, thank you for bringing those up because the legs are very black, they're very, very dark, or they're longer than the regular domesticated, the lane, or the fighting variety that have been loosed. The beak resembles that of a carnivore, it's more hock like in its appearance. The comb on the top of the head is almost nonexistent, and the rooster with its many tail feathers, will have two very iridescent tail feathers that are slightly askew. The stare, it's a very baleful Stare. I'm grateful for the movie Jurassic Park being filmed here because I really think that they copied the movement, the features of the Polynesian junglefowl after this, because it moves the same. She pointed out he would've been hiking in the interior. It just has that Velociraptor movement. Well, what a lot of people don't know that if they unexpectedly come upon a small brood of chicks that are being lord it over by a hen and a rooster. The local boys know this, but they might not know it. Therefore if for whatever reason that the hen lowers her head and spreads out her wings in the baby chicks come running into her for protection, and I've even had to move you out of the way, look around for the rooster, because now the law of the jungle, the law of the wild will occur. That is fight or flight. The rooster will see that his mate has chosen to fight. Instead of taking flight. He will come to her aid. He will come to the aid of his family. He will attack you. I tell you, it's not a pretty sight because it fly straight up in the air and that comes down with his legs moving in a very rapid scissor like fashion, it will do damage. That's why there's always a guard when the Keiki are trying to get the baby chicks because that way they can at least fight off the rooster for a short time. It's a shame that people are not seeing this. Never mind that this isn't the time, sorry.Lonnie Lugo:	Realistically a lot of people, they're chickens to them and not everybody knows the history and the bonding that these chickens have with each other, especially the Polynesian ones. It's sad that I've been hearing all these.Juan Lugo:	Our culture is slowly being eradicated by so many different things and it's sadness and that's why it's a nice thing to be having the spouting horn, if I may share that.Lonnie Lugo:	Of course I was going to ask you to tell me the story, I love it.Juan Lugo:	The spouting horn is one of those things here that, gives an idea as to who these people are and how they had traveled such a long distance. The island of Kauai possesses such a spiritual prowess that is found in few places of the world, and it's one that I've shared over and over again. But it's not just my interpretation, it is the interpretation of the ancients, because it's been established that the people that came here arrived some 100, 300 years AD. What I find amazing is that they traveled 2,500 miles over the open ocean, long before European man, Western man. But what I find most amazing, imagine that if you were going on a journey that you did not know what an environment you are going to have, whether it's going to be friendly or hostile, so you would have to bring those items that would support your society. Traveling this great distance of 2,500 miles, one cannot help but wonder that the supplies, the jungle fowl that they brought with them, the Cocky nut, all of these things that they brought with them, were in parallel and becoming lost, [00:30:00] and why did they not land on the first island that they would encounter? They bypassed the big island of Hawaii, they bypassed La Villa, Nike, Maui, or Oahu. All of these islands they bypassed, they came to the island of Kauai from here they settled. They were able to discern that this island was the first island that had been created by our volcanic goddess Pele. She was the daughter of Papa, Mother Earth, Wakea, father heaven. It was she that was credited for building these islands first. So the spouting horn plays a very important role. When she was on the big island of Hawaii, creating that island, she decided to return to the first island that she had created, and so returned she did as a Makua, and as she spirit in about, she spied this one young man that was so ruggedly handsome, so very good-looking. She was so taken by him that she turned herself into a mortal. She wooed the young man and the young man felt instantly and madly in love with her. But when he discovered that she was a goddess that long after his life, there would be others that would taste the sweetness of her lips, enjoy the magic of her charms, he became very sad, very forewarned, he no longer wished to live. Pele would try to convince him, that she would be giving up her position as a goddess, he did not believe her. He continued on his downward spiral. Pele panicked, returned to the big island of Kauai, where she would try to convince her parents Papa and Wakea to let her give up her position as a goddess. That is when she was told that her young man was so weak, that he would not see the moral sunset. So she asked her sister, Hiiaka to quickly make her way to Kauai, convince the young man to wait for her, nurse him back to health, the sister agreed to change herself into the Hawaiian hawk, that he or she flew to Kauai. Once she reached here, she changed herself back into a mortal. She went to the young man's hut, where she found him very close to death's door, and so she very gently picked up his head, placed it upon her lap, was gently administering the liquid from the tea plant. She did this, until the young man slowly started recovery. In his recovery, he thought it was his beloved Pele that had returned to him, and so he started whispering sweet words of affectation, sweet words of endearment. The sister remained silent, afraid that if she were to tell him the truth, that he would once again succumb to his desire to die so silently, she continued. Pele no longer could stand being away from her young man decided to return. Return she did unannounced them when she saw this tender scene, when she saw the head of her lover on the lap of her sister, and she heard him whisper sweet words of affectation, of endearment she thought that her sister had stolen her lover. In that moment of jealous rage, as her heart burst into a 1,000 pieces, she turned them both into the Ohio flower. The Ohio flower that is blood red in color, who stamen resemble that of lovers embracing. She banished to the island of Lehua, which is next to the island of Niihau off the shore of Kauai. As she returned to the big island of Hawaii where she continue venting her anger, that is when she was told by her other sisters that she had committed a serious error. They explained what their sister had been attempting to do. Pele realized that yes, she did. So now she asked them to go to Lehua, pluck the flower, return it to her. Her last act as a goddess would be to turn their sister and her lover back into their mortal forms. They agreed, but because it was a very dangerous journey, they asked their brother to accompany them. He agreed. They changed themselves into the Moonui, the giant lizards, they made their way to Kauai. Once they reach here, the brother tired from being ever vigilant, decided to stay and rest while the sisters continued the short distance to Lehua. After they left, he slipped into the sea cave and promptly fell asleep. The sisters made their way to Lehua, they plucked out the flower, they returned to Kauai, they did not find the brother, they thought that he had left without them since they had not encountered any danger, and so they left. The brother awoke from his slumber, waited for his sisters to arrive. When they did not arrive, he went searching for them. He searched frantically around the island of Lehua, Niihau, Kahoolawe rock to no avail, he could not find them. Fearing the worst that they had been [00:35:00] captured by a giant sea creature, that he had failed them. Knowing that he could not face the wrath of his sister or his parents, he returned to Kauai, slipped back into the sea cave and has remained there ever since. So when you go to the spouting horn, watch as he sprays water high up into the air in the hopes of attracting the attention of his sisters. When they do not return, listen as he moans for the loss of the love of his family. Pelle to this day, because of her record to love continues to vent her anger and her frustration in the lava and the hot gas and the Ohi'a lehua tree, as it is known, is the first tree that grows when the lava has cooled sufficiently to allow plant life.Lonnie Lugo:	I've always loved that story. I guess I'm an old romantic even though it's sad.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask a question?Juan Lugo:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	Where did you learn that storyJuan Lugo:	My grandfather, my tutor, Kani told me that.FEMALE_1:	The one in you're named after?Juan Lugo:	Yes. This man would tell stories and he would mesmerize me. I would linger on his every word, his way of telling stories when we're having a February union and she's taken her head already. I know because my brother would say, ""where do you come up with all these story?"" I said, ""if you guys would stick around and listen and [inaudible 00:36:40] all the time you would have known."" Alanine was like god.Lonnie Lugo:	Do I have to listen to this again?Juan Lugo:	This is the first time that you've actually listen to it all the way.Lonnie Lugo:	I think so.Juan Lugo:	It is, you have not done this before.Lonnie Lugo:	Well, because it was always fighting and chatting in-between the story.Juan Lugo:	She's an only child. So I came from a family of 11, and they took her and she was the little lanai dog, ""comes sister, come sister.""Lonnie Lugo:	Well, I really appreciate this time with you, no interruptions and just listening to the stories again and again, but most enjoyable because there's no breaks, no interruptions, nothing, and I appreciate hearing them again.Juan Lugo:	Fine, Diana please. For the hamburger.Lonnie Lugo:	You owe me my hamburger, for coming here today.Juan Lugo:	Do I have time for another real quick story, or no?FEMALE_1:	You have two minutes?Juan Lugo:	Then no, I won't.FEMALE_1:	But, can I ask a question?Juan Lugo:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	Sometimes some people like to close, you don't have to do this, but some people like to close by saying what they admire about each other.Juan Lugo:	What I admire about you is nothing, yet everything. Now I'm serious. We have gone through our journey together, a lot of laughter, very few tears, and if there were tears, most of them were because of our happiness. So I feel very blessed to have been put in your path, so that we walk this path together.Lonnie Lugo:	Even though when we met, I couldn't stand him. He was Mr. Aloha.Juan Lugo:	You running out of time, you'll only talk about that.Lonnie Lugo:	But thank you anyway for everything you've done for me, you've always been there and you are there and I hope you'll always be there.Juan Lugo:	Let me see, if I have to buy you a hamburger, no I'm not going to be there. I definitely want to take this opportunity to talk StoryCorps for having us being able to share our memories, because those are the things that will pass on, things that I would have liked to have had, the stories, the songs. So StoryCorps, thank you and Lonnie especially thank you for putting up with me in all of these years.Lonnie Lugo:	Thank you.Juan Lugo:	You go girl.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
MBY008211,"Erin Dickey:	[00:00:00] My name is Erin Dickey, I'm 25. Today's date is August 21st, 2011. We're in the Tri-Cities, Washington, and I'm sitting across from Linda who I met about half an our ago.Linda Alexander:	I'm Linda Alexander. I'm currently 58, and this is August 21st, 2011. We're in the Tri-Cities, and I I'm the storyteller.Erin Dickey:	Linda you mentioned you wanted to talk about a life changing altering experience that you had. Can you tell me about that?Linda Alexander:	Correct. I was in victim of crime when I was 20 weeks pregnant in advanced maternal age. What I can recall, it's very similar to 911 when your life is won way up until the time of the crime, and then you have to live with and experience the changes that the crime creates in your life. All the way from the shock and terror of realizing that if you don't survive this crime this will be your last moments in our present time and that if you don't survive then your family gets noticed that you've been murdered. It causes you to fight with everything within you in order to survive the perpetrator. So do me by nearly breaking my neck, which is an extremely excruciatingly painful experience. Your eyes bug out, you seen patterns. I can't even describe the pain, but it temporarily paralyzes your body. You cannot fight. I had been fighting with him and and actually pleading and begging with him not to commit this crime. I I tried to reason with him. I tried to tell him that if he went away, that I wouldn't report the crime. Per the crime was try to get away from him, I broke part of a chandelier on the back of my head, then I was trying to get away from him. He had a hold of my wrist and huge clenching. I couldn't get away from him and he threw me to the floor, and then he was on top of me on top of a pregnant belly and I'm fighting him and I don't normally bite people but I bit his forearm with everything I had and he got really mean. There were a couple of times during that attack where I had what people describe as an out-of-body experience. I'm looking at the scene because I'm so horrified by it that I just want to get away. I'm trying to determine whether I'm actually going to stay or if I'm actually going to just give up and and expire. This person not only beat me, but he raped me and tried other unmentionable acts. Then as he's leaving, he said, ""I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll be back to murder you and finish you off."" What was really most terrifying was I didn't known this person, I had no idea who he was. The police, of course, said, normally people who are victims of crime know their attacker or had met them before. But I didn't know who this person was, I didn't know why they were attacking me, and I had no way of helping the police in apprehending this person. When he did confess to the crime, it was at a mental health facility, so there was no question as to who committed the crime. However, because he did it in a mental health facility, part of what was brought up was that he was insane at the time of the crime and therefore could not be held accountable for it. This furthered [00:05:00] my trauma because what happened was he left me with a mental illness because I suffered panic attacks, I suffered flashbacks. I had a hard time sleeping from midnight to five, actually ever since the crime, and part of the problem was when I would go to sleep, my brain would go to places and terrify me with nightmares. Sometimes I could wake up out of them and sometimes I couldn't. The other problem was I had a lot of blocking, I would go into a room and forget what I walked to that room for. I just would tremble uncontrollably. What was once a safe world was no longer safe. I went into hypervigilance and people enjoyed startling me, and I said, ""If I collapse, you're going two have to call 9-1-1 because every time you do that, my heart stalls."" For a long time I had a very irregular heartbeat, about every 25 seconds, it would stall and restart and it was part of what has happened because of the severe prolonged stress of enduring this attack was I've had an enlarged heart. I have mitral valve regurgitation, I have severe hypertension. When I get super panic attack, I just basically blackout, I just totally collapse. It's really difficult because although I had people counsel me, they have no idea how your brain changes, how you go from a peaceful state to just everything is no longer safe. I'm in the process of trying to put my life back together while I watch our court system has acquitted the person that caused this attack because he had a mental problem. They said he was insane at the time. Just March of this year, he wrote to a judge saying, ""I wasn't insane at the time"", because he's really tired of being at a mental hospital and he wants his freedom back. I have done research, the Sentencing Review Board has changed his status from Level 3 sex predator and to Level 2 and now they wanted to put it down to Level 1. Well, the public concerns should be that this person should he be released, would be on the street without a record that he is a sexual predator and also he won't have to register as a sex predator which personally I believe he is very likely to re-offend. He said he would be back to murder me, and I'm really concerned that justice hasn't been served, that our tax dollars have been abused. I'm trying to make an appeal to all women who have been similarly injured because although we have community resources like Sexual Assault Resource Center, most women I've talked to there do not seem to have a true grasp of what it's like to survive a life-altering event. The child that I was carrying, didn't miscarry write away, but he only lived 40 days after berth and he died of acute and chronic brain damage. Part of my concern is the court system is supposed to be based on fact. The levels at which sum of the facts were not true in this case. [00:10:00] For instance, they recorded that I was several weeks pregnant, which is far bigger difference in being 20 weeks pregnant halfway through a pregnancy. I truly believe that my child was traumatized because for the remainder of that pregnancy, I couldn't sleep from midnight to five. I was hypervigilant and there were times when I wasn't certain that I would actually be able to carry to term this child because of the trauma. There were times when I was really concerned that he wouldn't just some odd behavior. I must say that I am really appreciative of the fact that I did get to have him for a while. He was a very responsive child. I enjoyed holding him. He seemed very aware of my presence and he would visit with people for about 20 minutes and then he would let them know that he was going to fuss if he wasn't returned to me and I just was really traumatized when he died. I thought it was going to be around for me. It was an old man and the loss of this child just totally sent me into I was already in major depression, but it sent me into severe depression and it caused me a lot of difficulty because people do not understand that once you've been through this kind of trauma, you don't function well at all. Although I had worked for 20 years prior to this attack, they were highly critically, there attitude was, ""Well, it's just a baby, it's no big deal. Just get over it"" and I'm going ""No, this person murdered my life."" The fact that I'm still living and breathing is beside the point. Part of the problem is that the court system provided for him mental healthcare but the citizen who pays the taxes, they have denied the same amount of care and I think that that is a precedent to a violation of United States Constitution, 42 Section 1983, which is deprivation of rights under color of law. They have cared for someone who's very ill, but not the citizen who's paying the taxes on all of this, which is a wrong violation.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask a question?Linda Alexander:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	What was your son's name?Linda Alexander:	His name was Raymond.FEMALE_1:	Raymond.Linda Alexander:	Yeah.Erin Dickey:	I was wondering what was your life like? Can you describe a little bit of what your life was like before this attack, this event?Linda Alexander:	Yeah, this attack has changed my life because one thing is before the attack, I have to admit it. I was a really vain person. I never would leave my house without my hair, my makeup. After the attack I got to put on makeup and within seconds I would cry it off. I cried if I was awake, I would cry just minutes short of an entire day. I would cry all day long. Prior to this, I was a vain person and I was very proud of how I looked and I took good care of myself. After this attack I had a hard time. I said I couldn't put on makeup. I couldn't wear it all day I would just cry. I am now able to wear less clothes. For a long time I had to wear layers and layers of clothes because a way of protecting myself. Last year was the first year I could even put [00:15:00] a swimsuit on and the trauma was so bad and it's not a reasonable thing. But you just wear so many layers of clothes because you, I don't known how to describe it. You've been violated and you're trying to do anything to keep anyone from wanting to injure or hurt you again, at some, it's an unreasonable fear. It isn't something you can really control. After such a violation, people think you just have to have a positive attitude. I've had the most positive attitude I can. However, once your brain gets altered or changed by trauma, there are some things that you really can't fight. It's the same thing I'm aware of how my process and thoughts worked prior to the attack, and I have really tried to get back there, but I have had to learn to adjust and make myself operate now with the traumatized brain. It doesn't show up on scans or anything. I just happened to understand that it operates differently than it used to. I have a difficult time taking tests anymore because sometimes I take a lot longer to take any testing because I have to double-check things quite often. I have to read things very carefully because my interpretation of what I read isn't accurate. Sometimes I have to read it five or 10 times until I understand that what I'm reading, to me a lot of times they're just words for me to get the content out of them and understand the content is very difficult because I'll read it and interpret it in one way and I had to reread it and understand what the intent of the communication is different than what I'm interpreting it. I never had that difficulty before the attack. I know that I see things differently. I have to really look at things a bit differently. It is odd to describe to people that I see things differently than they are, but I do. I do seen things differently and I have two there again, verify what I'm looking at. It's very much like photography. Your mind can edit out things so you don't want to see but photography, unless you put a screen or filter on it, it shows you exactly what's there. Learning to deal with a brain that is traumatized and that thinks differently and operates differently than it did before an attack or trauma is a different learning.Erin Dickey:	I ask how long ago the attack occurred.Linda Alexander:	It happened quite a while ago, but that's part of the problem. I think most people just think, ""Oh, she's still little attacked."" They don't realize that the severity, the trauma, the fact that you have no control over someone, who's substantially larger than you. Although you may fight, and I was looking for objects to fight back with, but I was concerned that, if I got anything to injure this person, they would just use it on me, and I wasn't successfully fighting him well at all. Of course, being 20 weeks pregnant, your body's energy is into protecting the child that you're carrying, and so you'd create a disadvantage. Like I said, he had me imprisoned in my home. Basically had a lock hold on my wrist [00:20:00] and wasn't letting me go. I would have probably left my house, running down the street with no clothes on, if I could have gotten away. It was not an option.Erin Dickey:	Did he break in?Linda Alexander:	Yeah.Erin Dickey:	What was the reaction of your friends and family after they heard about this?Linda Alexander:	They didn't say much. I don't know why. For one, it took me a couple of days to talk to some of my relatives, because every time I was around them, there were children, and I didn't want to talk to them about this attack, when they were around young ears that always seem to hear so much. So it took a while. Plus, as I've stated before, my ability to talk, I was scared, silent. I was so traumatized that actually, I don't know how to describe it. Your ability to function and talk, it gets suppressed. It's hard to describe what terror does to you, when you've been severely terrorized. So my ability to communicate with people, to know who to talk to, it's all the information I knew got suppressed, and it's almost like I look at people and I couldn't remember their names, and I knew them. But when you've been severely terrorized and traumatized, your brain goes into stall mode. That's what the police said. Well, ""She is acting more like a witness than a victim."" and obviously you haven't been trained very well when you encounter person that has been severely traumatized. For one, your ability to verbalize is impaired. But also the other thing that happens is, when you realize that event could have been your final moments, you look at things really differently, because while I'm here today, I can still flowers. I really never looked at flowers quite the same way. It gives you a new understanding, you really look at things more intently. You really take things in and appreciate them. Because it wasn't like a advancing disease. It was a sudden unexpected event, where you realize that could have been it. So you do look at things differently.Erin Dickey:	How long was it before you were able to speak again, and to feel a little bit more able to face things, to not cry, how long did that take you?Linda Alexander:	I cried severely for a year after, and second year. I'd say about five years.Erin Dickey:	Yeah.Linda Alexander:	People would just really be distressed that I would cry so much, but it wasn't an optional thing. It's just a byproduct of maybe even just a brain-shift. Because normally, before this attack, I was pretty lighthearted and funny, and after the attack, I'd stay in a severe state of shock. I still am in shock, but I'm a little more able to communicate about it than I was at that time.Erin Dickey:	Why [00:25:00] do you think this man did what he did?Linda Alexander:	I'm not a psychiatrist or understanding. I think he was perhaps trying to test the system. I think that, he basically wanted to see if he could commit a crime, and at the time he said that, well, I don't really know. Clearly, the person is not well, if he decided to injure another person, and I think that once he confessed he was, and had consequences of going to the mental facility for a long time then. I think he thought he could commit this crime, and be hospitalized for a little while, and then they'd let him back out on the street, and they probably would have had, if it had been a different victim. I had been at every court hearing, and I have submitted statements each and every time, because I think he's ill, but I don't think he's quite as ill as they have listed him. I think he is predatory, and I'm concerned that he'll injure somebody else, if he is ever allowed on the street again. I'm very seriously concerned about that. I think it should be of public concern as well.Erin Dickey:	Has he ever been able to contact you or express remorse, or have you had any contact with him?Linda Alexander:	I've seen him in the courtrooms, and he says, ""I'm sorry for what happened,"" but that's not saying I'm really sorry I injured you, that I've changed your life. It's a whole world of difference. I said he wanted to have this, be in another hospital in 15 months, and they may have had I not been in court, but I was in court, and I'm thinking that this crime should have been three strikes. You're out and he should have been out for a long time, because for one, it has caused me to study the law a lot, because unlike a migrant worker, for whom the prosecuting attorney had appointed an attorney to help him with his losses, they didn't do the same for a citizen. So I've had to do the research and from what I have determined, to actually intend to do a crime is a felony offense, to actually go into somebody's presence and remain in their residence when asked to leave is a burglary, and also to imprison a person in their home is a crime, to beat and attack a pregnant citizen isn't a second degree rape, it's first degree rape, to threaten death threats, if they combined all the elements of this crime, there is no way that this person should ever see the street again. I'm concerned that there's no accountability for how our tax dollars have been used in this case. I am concerned about the complacency of people who hold these elective offices, and also government offices who don't care for a fellow citizen, who not only is violated by a perpetrator, but has to witness them caring for the perpetrator, and all of his needs while denying equitable, or same to the citizen who suffered greatly from this crime. Well, [00:30:00] I just find it very concerning that the founding fathers of our constitution never intended this action when they wrote the laws of the constitution. Well, actually, for the person who is the public servant who took an oath of office to protect and defend the constitution, they have supposedly perjured their oath of office by these actions and I think that there should be consequences. As a tax paying citizen to be denied the same care and services as the person that violated me is just clearly wrong.Erin Dickey:	Yeah, you mentioned that there was a possibility he's going to go free soon. Is he in a hospital now or is he in prison now? What is the situation right now?Linda Alexander:	Not in prison. He got sent to the mental hospital because he had a mental defect.Erin Dickey:	What was the mental defect?Linda Alexander:	I do believe it's schizophrenia, which I'm not positive. I have read the documentation on it. Personally, it's just a really angry person who should have anger management among other things. It concerns me that as a predator, he has more rights, essentially than a citizen. I think any woman who's been violated in similar manner, we should have them be allowed to connect and not just through SAARC, because in a way they're keeping us separated and we need to get people to unite so that we can support one another. There's a certain type of sisterhood when you have women attacked and they have a better understanding of the violation and how it totally changes your life. It changes it from being safe to one where other people who have not experienced the trauma don't understand that you are trying the very best you can. You don't mean any ill to anybody, but you just don't function the same way before. It's like you have to work against your brain which has shut down or refuses to operate in some areas. In areas where you're really familiar with the information, it's just that you cannot access it, yet at the same time your brain tends to almost sabotage you and terrorize you from having been the victim of such a violation.Erin Dickey:	Have you ever been able to speak to a woman in a similar situation?Linda Alexander:	No. That's what I'm appealing to. There's other women who've suffered similarly that we could connect. Part of the problem is, they're trying to protect people's privacy and I think in a way that's good, but in other ways, it would be much more healing to be able to connect [00:35:00] with people who really understand that trauma and what it's like to survive that. Because people around you that are even relatives, they want to understand. I just don't think they can totally, really, even with the best intentions, understand what it's like. The way I can relate to that is, a couple of months before my child died. I read in the newspaper about a child dying of SIDS and I was very empathetic. I was just like, wow. But when it happened to me, the event was so much more traumatic than even I couldn't understand. That's how I can relate to same even if you're empathetic and you want to understand when you actually go through that yourself it's a deeper valley.Erin Dickey:	Can I ask if you could say something to a woman who has just experienced something similar. Any advice, what would you say if you could just talk to someone?Linda Alexander:	Wow. Well, there is hope. There are people out there who do understand. You have to not give up and it will drive you to the edge of self destruction because there are people out there who don't care to understand, but you have to seek all the positives you can. You learn to befriend yourself because so many other people can't even comprehend what it's like. Don't reject yourself like the perpetrator has, learn that. Within you can develop a better understanding of yourself and a better understanding of what your needs are, because other people may mean well, but they may not have what your specific needs are. You need to have a lot of self empathy, a lot of self-understanding, and be in your own court because as with a crime, you're the only person really there, whether you can protect yourself or not. You need to extend self-care and not beat up on yourself because others don't understand and can't be there for you. If at all possible, try and connect with other women who've been through similar traumas because there are people who really do understand what it takes to come back in time, not just survive, but to thrive, and to rebuild.Erin Dickey:	We have about one minute left. Is there anything else that you wanted to say in the conversation?Linda Alexander:	Well, as a citizen who hasn't committed a crime, I do believe we need to not further injure our citizens who having given up any of our rights, who are not second-class citizens because someone deprives them of nearly their life, their dignity, [00:40:00] and hope, actually, so don't give up hope.Erin Dickey:	Thank you so much, Linda. It's been amazing hearing your story.Linda Alexander:	Thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
MBY008426,"Aron Palma Chavez:	[00:00:00] My name is Aron Palma Chavez. I am 23 years old. Today is October 10, 2011, and we are in Denver, Colorado. My relationship with Alexandra Pool is best friend.Alexandra Pool:	That's very sweet of you.Aron Palma Chavez:	We're friends, we've known each other for a while through Greenhouse Scholars, a great organization that has helped me a lot.Alexandra Pool:	My name is Andra Pool, full name Alexandra. I'm 30 years old. Today is October 10, 2011. This is Denver, Colorado. I met Aron through Greenhouse Scholars, where I work. That's facts.Aron Palma Chavez:	That's facts.Alexandra Pool:	So Aron, when I first met you, you were a senior in high school and I had just started working at Greenhouse Scholars, and the organization was pretty new. So we hadn't yet seen the results of our work or what we would really accomplish. We had big goals but hadn't yet achieved any of those goals. You are one of the first people to truly believe in our model and what we were doing. In fact, you helped to recruit new students to apply to the program. You even drove them up to interviews. What was it about what we were doing that you believed in?Aron Palma Chavez:	I think it was the fact that I had a passion for what you guys were doing. I really believed in what Pete and everybody spoke about and I could just see it in your guys' actions, that you guys actually cared about the community. You guys cared about students like me. It wasn't like just any other organization where they just feed a lot of money, just give us money or whatever. It's actually more than just following through with the money I guess. So I think it was just that and also the fact that there's a challenge. I felt like it was a competitive scholarship and I just thought that if I could get this scholarship, it'll be something that would go down in history with me. So I'm a Greenhouse Scholar and I know that Greenhouse Scholars in the future is going to be a great scholarship. You guys are going to Chicago here pretty soon, so it's pretty remarkable, what you guys have done.Interviewer:	What was it about the organization that made you see and make you really passionate about it?Aron Palma Chavez:	I think the fact that I had a passion for public education and education reform and that I wanted to see youth like me get to higher education pretty much ,that's pretty much the reason why I supported Greenhouse Scholars.Alexandra Pool:	At the same time, I know that you were hesitant to apply at first. You had a personal philosophy that made it difficult for you to apply at first.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	What was that?Aron Palma Chavez:	Personal philosophy was about pity. Not wanting to get any I guess.  Just pretty much any pity. I didn't like telling my story. I didn't like telling people that I was a poor kid from the hood. I came from a single parent household that was low-income, minority student, who had free or reduced lunch in this really deprived school. I just didn't like that. I had difficulties understanding that. But I finally realized that it's more than that and I just knew I had to help and by accepting who I was it was the only way I was going to be able to help my community. That's pretty much it, I just didn't like the whole pity thing, but I got over pretty soon.Alexandra Pool:	We certainly have never pitied you. More, we're so proud of what you've done, what you've achieved. It's totally our pleasure to work with you. You actually benefit us in so many ways in terms of enriching our lives.Aron Palma Chavez:	No, I feel that Greenhouse has done a big favor to me and my family. It's like working with Ben, even before Ben, with Greg and with you, with Pete, with everybody, it's just a nice big family, and I think it's going to continue to grow with the scholars and with the symposium. I think this symposium is a big thing. The symposium is pretty much where all the scholars come in every summer and get to know each other and get to know the scholarship and the philosophy of it. I think that's really important. If you guys continue to do that, I think it's going to be great for future generations.Alexandra Pool:	Thanks, Aron.Interviewer:	Do you want to talk a [00:05:00] little bit about how you first learned about the Greenhouse scholarship and how you first heard of the program?Aron Palma Chavez:	Well, the first time I heard about Greenhouse Scholars was through my counselor, Sintia Castillo , who was actually a really great lady. She helped me out a lot and she pretty much handed me this application in the counseling room and she's like, ""You're going to get this, I know you're going to get this,"" and I was like, ""Another pity story."" That's exactly what I told her. I just learned from her and I applied and I investigated a little bit more about the company, about the scholarship and that's when I realized, it's more than just any other scholarship because they're just not giving you money.Alexandra Pool:	One of the things that unites all the scholars perspective that you have in common is that you have overcome, sometimes extreme adversity in your lives, but you use it as a source of strength and pride for the future instead of an excuse or a reason to fail.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	What is the biggest challenge you faced when you were a child?Aron Palma Chavez:	I've had a couple of challenges, but probably the biggest one would have to be coming from a single mother and having to raise my little sister. That's probably the biggest one and going to college, working. Pretty much, there's a lot of things. I just can't be really specific with one thing because I think it's been a combination of a lot of things.Alexandra Pool:	Tell me more about your sister. What did you actually have to do? When you said, ""I helped raise my sister,"" tell me what that actually meant.Aron Palma Chavez:	A lot of it was pretty much what a father would do, playing that fatherly figure for my sister because my stepdad wasn't around at all. So pretty much having to teach her a lot of things. Having to teach her how to read, having to teach her how to talk, having to teach her how to be respectful, manners, a lot of the small things. It's hard because at the same time, I also didn't have my father. So it's just difficult to know what a respectable young lady would be. So it's just hard. There's a lot of challenges in school, violence and stuff like that. I usually don't like to talk about the violence.Alexandra Pool:	Well, maybe I'll just ask you and you can decide whether you want to talk about it or not.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	But you did have some violence in your childhood that I know of.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	So tell me about that.Aron Palma Chavez:	Well, a lot of it was caused by my stepfather and a lot of it was gangs too when I was little. I did a lot of things that I don't like to talk about when I was younger. I didn't do them for the wrong reasons, I had good intentions. I wanted to help my family and I just didn't see any other way. I was a young kid who couldn't get a job, so I didn't really have many options, besides going into the streets and doing whatever I could do. But it's just a lot of things. I could guess I have learned from, a lot. Has made me mature a lot. They made mature a lot when I was younger, made me realize a lot of things about what an adult should be.Alexandra Pool:	You had a coming of age experience maybe when you were 16 that you told us about when you first interviewed for Greenhouse Scholars, a time when you took control of the situation with your stepfather. What happened?Aron Palma Chavez:	That situation was pretty much happiness. He got really physical with me one time. He came in the house and he tried to choke me. At that time I was older, I was stronger and I had just had enough. So I pretty much got up and I started fighting back, and during that time when I was fighting back, when I was kicking him out the house, I started realizing [00:10:00] that I needed to start fighting back for everything else, for my life, for my education. So as soon as I did that, as soon as the cops came, as soon as that day was just over, I went to bed, pretty much a new man and I just thought I needed to change my life. Just overnight, it just hit me that I needed to grow up and I couldn't be doing these things and I couldn't be doing a lot of things pretty much. So I started going to school a lot more.Interviewer:	How old were you then?Aron Palma Chavez:	I was 15, going to 16.Interviewer:	You said it happened almost overnight. That night, how were you different in the morning?Aron Palma Chavez:	Well, the fact that my mom was crying and we didn't know what was going to happen. Because there wasn't a man in the house, I guess was the reason my mom was working full time. He wasn't really working at all, my stepdad. But he did help somewhat, but most of the time he just caused a lot of problems and a lot of issues that we just didn't want to have around. It was just a certain shock, and realization that our lives are changed right now, but we didn't know if it was going to be for the better or for the worst. Because we were just scared of being alone and so just it was a lot of things and I think it was just me realizing that I needed to grow up. I think that's what it was.Alexandra Pool:	We'll talk about more uplifting things, I promise for the rest of the conversation. Because the best part about this whole story is that you have emerged such an amazing leader and you have so much to be proud of.Aron Palma Chavez:	Thank youAlexandra Pool:	It's not in any way a sob story because it's just a huge accomplishment. But I did want to ask, were you able to stay at your house after your stepfather left or did you have to move out of your house at any time or did you move around a lot as a kid even?Aron Palma Chavez:	Well, yeah. We moved around. We stayed at two of my aunt's house until finally my mom got a really good job and she was able to support me and my sister by herself in a government housing. I mean it was a lot of stuff but we got through it or getting through it. So, yeah.Alexandra Pool:	Yeah. When you're looking back at that time period now, I can tell it's still hard for you to talk about in private.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	What do you think about when you think about that time now? Do you feel like you've overcome it or do you still feel scarred from it? I'm sure you feel different on different days. Or do you not think about it?Aron Palma Chavez:	I just don't think about it. I think that's the biggest thing. I just don't think about it because it's over, it's in the past. I've learned from it. I guess I think about it when I have certain people that I know that are going through the same thing. When I go back to North where I graduated from, I have students that come up to me and they're going through some domestic violence issues too. I have to go back because I have to tell them how I got through my problems and how I overcame my problems, but I just don't like to thinking about it besides those times.Alexandra Pool:	Let me help. I know you've done a lot and we'll talk about some other ways that you've helped a bunch of students. Is there a story of a student in particular who you felt, without sharing their name, that you really can see the difference on that one kid?Aron Palma Chavez:	Recently there was this freshman boy, it was last year.Alexandra Pool:	Freshman in high school?Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah, freshman in high school. Brady Grant, who was a friend of mine that works at North. He had told me a story about him and I knew of him and one time I saw that he was just, it was around 6:00 or 7:00 and he was just outside, at school and everybody was gone and I went up to him and I asked him what he was doing [00:15:00] at school so late. He said he was waiting for the bus and I just looked at him and I was like ""The bus stop is way over there"" and I'm like, ""Are you sure you're okay?"" He just told me that ""I just don't want to go home"" and then I talked to him and actually told him, ""I'll give you a ride home if you want to come"" and then he asked me, ""Well, can we just drive around for a while and then we can go home"". Then we drove around and we talked and he told me his whole story about how he had an abusive father, how he didn't like going home at all and sometimes he would sleep in homeless shelters, if we define it better, because he had a really abusive father who's been in and out of jail. All I could do for him was tell him that I would always be there to help him out. I gave him my cellphone number after that conversation and every now and then he texts me if he needs a ride somewhere. And if I'm available, I give him a ride. Little things like that I think help because the student knows that he has someone that he can talk to and express how he is feeling because sometimes you don't even have that person. There's been a couple other ones but I think that's the most recent one.Alexandra Pool:	What do you think made you so successful? You graduated in the top of your class at North High School, you went on to University of Denver and you are seconds from graduating from college, what was it about you?Aron Palma Chavez:	That's funny, you say that because in class today, my finance professor was really boring me so I went on the internet and I looked up statistics on dropout factories and North High School is worst dropout factory in Colorado. Retention rate is 30 percent and that was the highest.Alexandra Pool:	Among Latino males it's even higher.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah, among Latino males it's even higher. That means that 70 percent of students are dropping out. I just looked at that when I was in class today and I was like, 'Well, I'm about to graduate from college like four-and-a-half years ago, I barely made it through high school. Well not barely, but I could have been one of those students that dropped out'. It's just shocking and I thought about is like, wow. I think a lot of it has to do with my maturity levels, the way I've matured as a young man and the things that I have gone through. But I think the biggest thing, would have to be the people that I've worked with; the mentors, the teachers, the fact that I'm not a shy kid, the fact that I can go up to anyone and tell him about the problems that I've had and the fact that I expect that from other students like this young man that I helped out. Because if you really want your voice heard, you can't stay quiet. You can't be that kid in the corner, just hang quiet if you're having issues or if you're having problems, you need to speak out and tell, ""Hey, I have an elephant on my foot"". That's what I tell Ruth, she's ever a little sister. I think a lot of North High School students and a lot of kids that are in these drop-off factories actually need to do is shout out and say, ""I need help"". Because that's one thing that as humans, we don't actually do is ask for help. I think that's one of the things I went out looking for help because I knew there was help, there's resources, there's people. Some of those people that helped me are JD Longwell, Tanko Muhammad, Brady Grant Sintia Castillo, Aaron Studelberg . I have a list of people, Greenhouse Scholars. But that was obviously after high school. It just keeps going and I think that's one of the things if I could ever recommend anything to a high school student, I would tell them just ask for help if they ever feel they need the help.Interviewer:	Early you were talking about how you had a personal philosophy where you didn't like anybody, or want anybody to [00:20:00] pity you in any way. Then you talked about being comfortable.Aron Palma Chavez:	Asking for help.Alexandra Pool:	Asking for help when you needed it, so what was the turning point?Aron Palma Chavez:	I think a lot of it was my mentors that I had, sophomore year of high school. I had my counselor, Ms. Stone, freshman year, come up to me and she saw me as a really quiet shy kid like those kids that I was talking about that were in the back of the classroom. I was that kid, but she just saw something in me and also Mike Mascarinas was another big influence. They just saw something in me and they recommended me for this program called 'Minds Matter', which was a mentoring program, like the similar thing what Greenhouse does for the college students. What 'Minds Matter' did is it pretty much brought all these educated mentors with their college degrees, who had careers and brought them to North High School, one of the worst high-schools, and mentored all these sophomores. I actually qualified for the program. Ms. Stone kept heckling me about it to apply and I finally did apply. I got in and I had troubles like I had troubles at first when I met JD and Tanko who were my mentors sophomore year, because the whole point of the program was trying to get students from these urban schools into summer school college program. I had trouble with writing essays and tell them about my story. I think the first essay that I wrote, I wrote about the time my puppy died. I couldn't talk about the violence that I had at home. I couldn't talk about the times I would go hungry and I would go to bed hungry or stuff like that. I couldn't talk about that. I just didn't feel the need to share that information, but JD and Tanko really helped me with that. I think to answer your question, I think it's just a combination of both an adult and a child and realizing that every child has a potential in them and every child can do something and you have to figure what it is and that's what Ms.Stone and Ms. Mascarinas did for me. They just didn't give up on me. That's pretty much what started it all.Alexandra Pool:	What was your transition into college like?Aron Palma Chavez:	Into college? Hard. My first year I started at Colorado School of Mines for engineering. I wasn't prepared pretty much. Just to keep it simple, I wasn't prepared at all. Studying habits, discipline, a lot of things. It's just coming from North High School to Colorado School of Mines was just very, very hard for me and that's where my passion for public education reform kicked in and I realized that there needs to be something better out there for youth like me. I wasn't ready and then I transferred to DU and I loved college, I fell in love with the environment, the people, the learning and freedom.Alexandra Pool:	How has being a college student changed your identity, your perception of who you are?Aron Palma Chavez:	I don't know. I think the fact that I'm actually in college is a big thing, if you think about it. It's a big thing because nobody in my entire family went to college.Alexandra Pool:	Of your extended family, cousins?Aron Palma Chavez:	Nobody. Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	What percentage of them graduated from high school?Aron Palma Chavez:	Like 25, 30 percent, of them graduated from high school. I have a big family. It's amazing. It's sad. It's amazing and sad but I don't want to see that from my little cousins. I have a lot of little cousins that come up to me for advice. I have a little cousin right now who's just junior and I'm already helping out with her scholarship essays and a lot of things. She wants to go to Boulder. I tell her that I know a couple of people in Boulder [00:25:00] that can hopefully help her out.Alexandra Pool:	You can find me up if need be.Aron Palma Chavez:	It's pretty remarkable.Alexandra Pool:	How does it feel? You've got the weight of so many people on your shoulders. You said all your cousins and siblings are coming up to you for advice. People from your high school are looking to you to be their success story. How does that feel?Aron Palma Chavez:	I really don't feel any pressure. I think whatever I do, people always tell me it's going to be something great, I'm just waiting for it. I think it's just the passion that I have. The passions for whatever, whether it's my education, whether it's the work that I'm doing right now, I'm always passionate. I'm always trying to go a step higher, a step further. I think there's really no pressure. I think I'll be happy just with whatever I do. But I know that one thing that I do want to do is I want to change those dropout rates. That's one thing that I will do is try to help my high school, try to help my community to see more people like me, more students like me get to go to the higher education field and get careers. It bothers me to know that a lot of my fellow peers and fellow community members, fellow North siders aren't going to the places where they should be.Alexandra Pool:	Well, you're not just talking here. You're not just saying that dropout rates are something that you're passionate about. You're not just helping your family and a student here and there. What are you doing? What have you already done?Aron Palma Chavez:	I don't know if I have enough time for all of the stuff that I've done. But I mean, a lot of it is just going back to my high school and being there. Even when I have a full-time work schedule, a full-time school schedule, a full time big brother schedule, I still always find the time to go back to North and help out with the students and just little things.Alexandra Pool:	Have you started a program to do something just like that?Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah. Well, I've started a couple of programs through my fraternity, Royal Retention of Youth and Latino leaders. It's a conference where we bring in about 200 to 250 male freshmen to DU from five or six, we're going to increase it to six schools next year to pretty much get the whole college atmosphere. So far on the third year that we've done it, we've had a lot of good responses, a lot of good feedback, saying that the students are loving it and the fact that they're seeing. I think the big thing is just seeing a person like them in higher education, it just speaks loud. Because like I said before, nobody in my family graduated from high school or got to college. When they see a male, Latino in college, they're like, ""Oh, I can do that?"""" Yeah, you can do that."" That's what we tell them. I think it's just little things like that.Alexandra Pool:	You said you started not only Royal but a couple of other programs, I don't know about some of the others. I know Royal. I know it's been successful.Aron Palma Chavez:	There's Kipp mentorship program, which is the Kipp Collegiate High schools have become a success throughout the nation, where we have a mentoring program where all our brothers go in and every Friday we talk to these men like juniors. We've been working with them since freshman year and we've had a lot of male identity workshop where we help them understand what the male roles are perceived to be and what they should be. It's a lot of things that we feel could help them and benefit them to become better male role models in the community. Then we've also done a lot of workshops with college and careers and stuff like that. It's really great to see how the kids respond to it. They really love the program. It's a lot of the things that I've done have been a lot of mentoring and a lot of working with the community, a lot of social issues. I started a mural back in high school during the redesign of my school. That was a big controversy. It was during the midst of the year that we had the highest dropout rate, which was my year, all seven class. I think as I continue in life, as I continue my career, [00:30:00] all these things that I've done and I will continue to do, will help me get to where my goal is, which is to change this perception that Latino males or Latinos or minorities in general can't succeed or can't get to higher education or can't get to the places where we need to be. But for now, I got to work somewhere, start small, and I'm okay with starting small. I know that eventually I'll get to where I want to get.Alexandra Pool:	What do you think about when you think about college graduation, the day itself?Aron Palma Chavez:	I think about my family and I think about my mom. I think about my community, pretty much. I don't know, that's it, it's going to be a good day. I want to postpone it because I just think it's going to be a crazy, hectic day too. My dad's coming all the way from Mexico, he's getting his visa. So yeah.Alexandra Pool:	What do you mean when you say your community?Aron Palma Chavez:	To keep it simple it's just pretty much my community, I guess the Denver community, I'll just keep it simple. But it's the North High School community, it's the West High School community. It's the communities where I grew up. I grew up all throughout Denver. I know these streets like the back of my hand, so yeah, I will never forget.Alexandra Pool:	Well, I think you've talked about wanting to make a difference and obviously you're so passionate about giving back to the community. But at the same time, you have professional goals that may be different outside of education. So how do you want to balance the two of those in terms of giving back, but also being a professional in the workplace, and how might being a professional make you actually better at doing that job than if you worked in, say, social work, if you've thought about it?Aron Palma Chavez:	No, I haven't actually. I think that's the thing, I probably will never think about it because I think I'll just do it. The balance is just going to be how I feel right, and I've always done how I feel right with my heart tells me to do. If I'm happy with putting maybe 80 percent of my effort with work, which has never been the case. It's always been 80 percent towards my community. I'll be happy. I think if I give back more, I feel more satisfied. So I think professionally if I make a lot of money it's not going to be a factor for me, it's the fact how many lives I can change, or how many people I can affect, so yeah.Alexandra Pool:	And well being successful yourself.Aron Palma Chavez:	Exactly.Alexandra Pool:	Will put you in a position to give back more?Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah, definitely. But yeah, I could see that, you could say that.Alexandra Pool:	What are you most proud of?Aron Palma Chavez:	I'm most proud of I think the fact that I have been able to raise my little sister and look back and say I haven't had any regrets, and I don't know. It's quite amazing, I was the first person to hold her after she was born, now seeing her at 11 years old, and going to start high school here pretty soon. Pretty remarkable. Pretty much that would be it.Alexandra Pool:	What's her name?Aron Palma Chavez:	Ruth, yeah.Alexandra Pool:	If you could thank one person, just take a moment and you've thanked several, what would you say to that one person? I think you said this a bunch already, but just a message to one person.Aron Palma Chavez:	Well right now, one person I would thank a lot would be my girlfriend, Makayla. Because I've gone through some of the toughest times right now in my life and she has been my biggest supporter right now and she has helped me a lot. We've only known each other for six months and a lot of people think that's crazy, I mean, it's not like we're getting married or anything. But I think we've come to understand and learn about each other a lot in these six months [00:35:00] because of the circumstances that I'm in and that she's in. She's halfway around the world right now and we still have strong communication, still supporting each other.Alexandra Pool:	Well and it's actually fascinating to hear you say that because you went through so much as a child, right?Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	You'd think that the obstacles you faced as a child would overwhelm anyone and anyone who got through that the rest of their life would seem easy by comparison. You said you're going through some of the hardest struggles that you've ever faced right now.Aron Palma Chavez:	Right now.Alexandra Pool:	When you're successful and in college and already giving back to your community, how's your past life helped you deal with those challenges you're facing right now?Aron Palma Chavez:	I think these are big boy problems that I'm going through right now. So they've helped me, but not so much because there's certain things that you need certain people, it's hard to explain. But like that father figure, like JD wasn't going to be here. If JD was my mentor and who I consider a big father figure, was not going to be here throughout my whole life, but yeah. So it's just things that you just grow up and you eventually learn and go on.Alexandra Pool:	Is there anything that you want to ask me or anything that we haven't covered that you really want to talk about? Is there anything you would want to tell your kids or grand-kids to know about you?Aron Palma Chavez:	I would probably tell them that whatever they do just follow their heart and their passions. And whatever it is even if the world tells them they're crazy, I hope they're not crazy, but just follow their heart and do what makes you happy, that's pretty much what I'm doing and will continue to do. I know that's what you did, because you're helping out all these wonderful people at Greenhouse and you love working with us. I see it in your face every time you work with us, every time you talk about us we're like your little children.Alexandra Pool:	It's kind of true. I was taking photos earlier, see why.Aron Palma Chavez:	So yeah, that's one thing I would tell my children is just to follow their heart because that's what I've been doing and that's what's gotten me this far so far.Alexandra Pool:	Have people told you were crazy? You said, follow your heart even if people tell you that you're crazy.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah, I've had a couple of people tell me I'm crazy. Especially, a lot of things that I've done, they tell me it's impossible, they tell me it can't be done. So I'll just tell them you're crazy. So yeah, it's about defying the odds and just living life to the fullest.Alexandra Pool:	Well, thank you Aron. You're not only an inspiration for everyone in your community and all the other Greenhouse Scholars, but also for me personally.Aron Palma Chavez:	Thank you, Andra.Alexandra Pool:	So I really appreciate you taking the time and I know that you've told us over and over that sharing your story is hard and I appreciate you.Aron Palma Chavez:	Yeah.Alexandra Pool:	For coming to my questions today.Aron Palma Chavez:	Thank you Andra. Thank you so much and I really appreciate everything that you've done for me and everything you've done for Greenhouse, everything you've done for my community, for the Denver community, for the Colorado community. Thank you.Alexandra Pool:	You're welcome.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
MBY008436,"Nicanor Garcia:	[00:00:00] Nic Garcia. Well, my real name is and Nicanor Garcia, age 17, date October 13th, 2011. Location Sheridan High School. Relationship, good friend.Leon Wathethiors:	My name is Leon Wathethiors Ramires Junior. I'm 18. Today's date is October 13th, 2011. We are at the Sheridan schools, and relationship he's my best friend.Nicanor Garcia:	All right. Who do you think you are? Not coming at you that way but, who do you think you are?Leon Wathethiors:	That's a hard question, honestly. I think I'm someone that's bound to be successful, and not to sound conceited or anything, but I just, I feel like everything in the world doesn't revolve around me, but it happens, it affects me. So I feel like I use all that just to, I'm bound to be successful.Nicanor Garcia:	Negatively or positively?Leon Wathethiors:	Well, both. Both actually. I try not to let anything affect me negatively. The only person that could do that is me. I don't think that should happen.Nicanor Garcia:	So why don't you let anything affect you negatively?Leon Wathethiors:	I feel like there's people out there that's their intentions. I've feel that there's only good intentions. There could only be intentions for good. Because in the end you can take it how you want it, and why wouldn't you want something good?Nicanor Garcia:	How do you not let negative things negatively impact you, like what people think or like what mentality do you have to carry out?Leon Wathethiors:	The IDGAF. I don't give a yeah. I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I feel like I had everybody, even my parents, not in a mean way, but I feel everything is for me.Nicanor Garcia:	You do things for yourself.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	It's cool that they tell you something. It's cool that they tell you, ""Yeah, do this."" But you don't want to tell me because I'm doing things for me. I'm going to be successful for me like right on for pushing me to do good, but I'm going down the right path for me.Leon Wathethiors:	I just felt like and we need to tell people I don't give a crap attitude. They think that ""Okay, he's bad kid."" But that's like, I do good because I want to do good. I do things because I want to do it. I don't know. I don't know how you feel like. How do you feel about that?Nicanor Garcia:	About what?Leon Wathethiors:	About your attitude towards life. What's your attitude towards life?Nicanor Garcia:	I feel I have many attitudes towards life. At times I feel like I'm too different, maybe more than two different people. Like I have my school mentality where it's like, ""Oh yeah, I have to get things done."" Well, pretty much my academic mentality. Then there's the social life mentality. Where you're social, you have friends and this and that. But I don't know.Leon Wathethiors:	But your gangster mentality?Nicanor Garcia:	My gangster mentality? It's something that I don't let get to me that much. But at times it comes out. I don't know. It's just the way I was raised. It's just the people I was around.Leon Wathethiors:	I feel like it's your wall. That's how you protect yourself. That's how you don't let anybody get to you.FEMALE_1:	So what is it? Like describe it.Nicanor Garcia:	My gangster mentality? It's pretty much, forget what everybody else says. It's just me, the people who I love, and the people who I let in. It's just us against the world with our backs against the wall.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	With all the weight on our shoulders and like still standing up.Leon Wathethiors:	From experience I feel like, how I see your gangster mentality is that you don't let no one mess with you, and you don't let no one mess with people you love. Even if it's people that you feel don't have your back, I still feel like you have so many other people's back.Nicanor Garcia:	I think that's dumb. Even when we stopped partying for a minute, remember because we have some problems? I'm by myself. My gangster mentality is in another neighborhood. I'm over here by myself and like [00:05:00] my word is my word. So if I say something, I'm not going to let anybody disrespect it or disrespect me or disrespect who I'm with in any form or tell me that I'm not about my word. I see myself going to all the parties I go to where it's like, I don't even go with my close friends at times, and it's like damn, I'm dumb. I'm pretty much by myself surrounded by people that I don't trust, can't depend on, can't even have a good time around really.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	That's why I stopped going out to house parties and all that scene.FEMALE_1:	You mentioned you're by yourself over here, what do you mean by that?Nicanor Garcia:	What I mean by being by myself?Leon Wathethiors:	Oh, yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	I don't feel like, trust pretty much. So I pretty much only trust my family and my close friends.Leon Wathethiors:	Which is the Wolfgang.Nicanor Garcia:	Which is, yeah the Wolfgang. It's me, my close friends, I could probably just name three close friends and the rest is my family. What was the question again?FEMALE_1:	Well, over here do you mean in this location?Nicanor Garcia:	This location, that's what I mean. Like down further South more, where it's calmer, but I don't know how to explain it.Leon Wathethiors:	Where did you grow up?Nicanor Garcia:	Where I grew up? I grew up a lot of places. My childhood when I was little I didn't know, when I was little and had fun like the good years I lived in Montbello, but I went to school in the North side of Denver by North High School. I went to Brian Webster Elementary. I grew up there like, now just the childhood that's like the fun years. But then I moved down here. But even though I was living down here, I really never hung around with friends over here outside of school. I would always be at my grandma's house, off of Colfax and Federal over towards what would be the west side of Denver. It's like the crossroads. Hanging around over there was what gave me the mentality that I was put in. Hanging around with my cousins, seeing what they were about.FEMALE_1:	What were they about?Nicanor Garcia:	They're the gangster mentality. They're the ones that raised me to that mentality. I would look up to them and in them I would see what I wanted to be when I was older. They were making money, they had all the cars. They had the respect, they had the word. It seemed like they didn't let anything get to them like their attitude. If you were against them or either you were with them or you were against them. I wanted to be with them.Leon Wathethiors:	How about now?Nicanor Garcia:	Now, growing up and seeing everything I've seen, what I've kind of seen so far, I see that it's not the case. They let a lot of stuff get to them. They, I don't know.Leon Wathethiors:	Like they fell under the pressure?Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah.Leon Wathethiors:	To be honest, I see that same pressure on you, and at times I see that you want to collapse but you always fight through it. I don't know what it is but you always fight through it.Nicanor Garcia:	Those are the times where I feel like I'm trapped between two people, between the way I was raised and I don't want to say where I want to be, but where-.Leon Wathethiors:	To get what you want?Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah. Between where I was raised and where I'm at. Pretty much. Because I'm not out there selling drugs. I'm not out there stealing, robbing. I had a couple opportunities. I took some, I didn't take others, but I'm not out there doing now. I'm out there trying to have a good education, trying to better my future for myself and now, some of my cousins that are older that I grew up with and my Uncle, they tell me, ""Learn from us, learn from us. Don't follow in our [00:10:00] footsteps. Learn from us and better your future for yourself."" They've been telling me that since I was 12, 13, first came around with them. But I don't know why. I just sometimes I just don't listen. Sometimes I feel it's better to learn from my own experience than from what other people tell you.Leon Wathethiors:	Then at the times how do you feel like? Well, I should have listened because the experience is always good.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah. That's what I mean, if it's a bad experience, I learn from it. It's better to learn from the bad experience.Leon Wathethiors:	Then how about the good experiences?Nicanor Garcia:	The positive experiences?Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	The positive experience would just be like being around my family. What do you mean by that though?Leon Wathethiors:	Even you will do stuff on the weekends. We're now isn't the best things on weekends. Then the next day you just feel like we shouldn't have done that. I should've listened to my family and then dislike the, but the guess is right. What do you see that your family does get to, whom looked up to?Nicanor Garcia:	I look up to my look up to my mom. I look up to my mom because she gave me the mentality that, ""Okay, people tell you,"" how do I say this? The mentality of don't do things for us. She used to tell me this as a parent. Don't do things for us. Don't go to school.Leon Wathethiors:	Tell the story.Nicanor Garcia:	So I was arguing with my mom about something, about a bad grade on a test or something.Leon Wathethiors:	I thought it was because you wanted to stay at another friend's house.Nicanor Garcia:	Oh, yeah. No, she didn't let me go to the mall.Leon Wathethiors:	Okay.Nicanor Garcia:	She didn't let me go to 16th Street Mall with my uncle Daniel. I was 11 or 12 at a time. This was a time when I started wanting to go out, hang out with friends and all that. It was already 8:00 o'clock at night. We were in the north side and she didn't want to let me go out with my uncle. My uncle Daniel, who's two or three years older than me. Anyway, she ended up telling me, no. So I threatened her somehow. I was like, ""Well, I just wont to go to school, is that what you want? I'm not a bad kid."" Blah blah blah, stuff like that. I won't go to school I'll do bad, this and that. She just looked at me. She's like, ""Are you dumb? Are you stupid?"" It was just the look that she gave me. She's like, ""Don't do things for us, do things for you. Don't threaten me by ruining your future, ruining things for you because that doesn't affect me, that affects you."" Ever since then that just was like a wake-up call.FEMALE_1:	She said all of that in a look?Nicanor Garcia:	No, in the look, she looked at me stupid, like, ""Are you dumb?"" But she explained to me; don't do things for us. Don't do things because we tell you to. Do things to positively impact you because in the end it's you who's making the decisions and not us. It's you who's getting impacted and not really us. So that's what she was telling me.Leon Wathethiors:	I felt like that was a wake up call for me too. Honestly, that story is what shaped me and even now with my parents, and I feel like I'm always trying to stump them. They'll try to give me stuff and I feel like I just try to stump them. Well just recently, I turned 18 and never had a bedtime in my life. Never. My mom never told me, I had bedtime.Nicanor Garcia:	We were what? Twelve years old at your apartment out at 1:00 in the morning.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly. I think it's just because she felt like I was safe. So it was a couple days ago, she asked me or she told me that I had to be in bed by 10:30.Nicanor Garcia:	We wanted to go eat somewhere, right?Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah. To Yogurtland.Nicanor Garcia:	It was late already. It was like, ""Yeah. I just got out of work,"" so it was like 9:30.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah, so she said, ""I want you in bed by 10:30."" So the last week of 17, I just felt like okay, they're buckling down on me just because it's the last week we could get out and then now that I'm 18, I feel like they've been on my case [00:15:00] more than anything. I don't know why that is. I feel like they've already shaped me like they could, so why are they trying to push me away? That's how I feel.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah.Leon Wathethiors:	I just don't understand that.FEMALE_1:	What did you do when she told you that you had to be in bed by 10:30?Leon Wathethiors:	So she said I had to be in bed by 10:30, so I just looked at her and I explained to her I've never had a bedtime in my life and I don't know why she's buckling down on me now. I think it's because the first week I turned 18, I went and bought a pack of Prime Times and my brother caught me and he snitched on me. I'm 18 but he still snitched on me so I didn't understand that and they gave me this huge talk like you were on top and now by smoking, you just let all these people in front of you for your athletics. Your academics are still here but then this is going to leave here. It felt like that one pack made them think that. I felt like they were talking to me like a failure, I didn't like that. Like I just dropped off the map. So now I feel like they're trying to get me back on track, but I never went off the track. If that make sense.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah. What did I tell you that night? I told you something similar to what I explained. I said, ""Who cares what they say?"" Yeah, they're doing it for your own good, who cares what they say? But you know what you're doing.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	It's not like you fell off the map. But then again, if you think about it, do you always know when you're not on the map or not? Do you always know when, not the map, but I'm saying when you're on track?Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	Or when you've fallen off track?Leon Wathethiors:	I do and I noticed that right after playing basketball I tore a ligament in my arm and that whole week I didn't do any work. I used it as an excuse like, ""Oh, you know I can't write.""Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah.Leon Wathethiors:	But I noticed and that's when I caught senioritis. I noticed I didn't notice that I was falling off track and I know that I'm catching up right now and I shouldn't be. I've never had that all the way from first grade to my junior year, I've never had to catch up.FEMALE_1:	Can you explain what you mean by ""track"" and ""falling off track""?Leon Wathethiors:	The track that they set for me, metaphorically, is that I'm college bound, success bound. I'm going to college and they feel like I got to do all these things to stay on that track and I think they feel like any little, as you said, ""bad thing"" is going to throw me off the track and I'm going to have to get replaced on it. So school comes first and then they know my athletics comes second and so everything that I do in my life is for school and athletics, and I feel like once I leave that safe zone, then that's what they feel is falling off the track. So whether that's hanging out with friends too late, whether that's smoking.Nicanor Garcia:	Anything that's a distraction?Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	The other day I was thinking to myself, sometimes I found myself falling off track but the point in it is that you just hop right back on. You don't get too side-tracked. There's a balance. Remember that balance that we were talking about? We were on a good balance for a minute, we did everything we had to do as a responsible student and as a son.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	Basically.Leon Wathethiors:	Even social life.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah, it was a good balance.Leon Wathethiors:	It was a great balance. We had straight A's. We were the same students forever.Nicanor Garcia:	For the first two years of high school, we were both ranked what?Leon Wathethiors:	Eleventh, ninth.Nicanor Garcia:	Eleventh, ninth?Leon Wathethiors:	Then 13.Nicanor Garcia:	We were the same kid with the same grade.Leon Wathethiors:	It was crazy. Then social life. We did party. We partied all the time but our grades still stayed the same.Nicanor Garcia:	Our athletics.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah. We never let anything get in front of our sports, basketball, baseball. I just feel like the more they tell me, and it sounds dumb, but the more they tell me it makes me wonder. Even like that smoking thing, see I'm not perfect.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah. At the beginning of this year, I went to Texas and I was driving on my way back to Denver and [00:20:00] I was with my mom and my dad and my little sister but my dad and my little sister were sleeping. It was early early in the morning and my mom was keeping me up because I had been driving all night. So I just started talking to her and I told her something, I was like, ""Mom, don't think so high of me because I don't want that point where you think so high of me and then you come to that point where it's just all deception. I don't want you to feel like you were you were deceived for so long."" I didn't tell her everything I was doing because she doesn't want to hear that.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	Nobody's parents wants to hear that. Yeah.Leon Wathethiors:	That's how I felt it happen too. So with my cousins, I talked to them all the time, how we used to party and all that but they're battling. I tell them, ""Look, you could have a balance. I party all the time, I've probably partied more than you guys and I was a top-notch student last year."" But I felt that when they were getting lectured they would not break down but they'd tell. So my cousin Halica , she told my auntie, ""You think Leon's such a good kid but he's not."" So I just felt like everybody had this high standard for me but at that moment it dropped and that's what happened with my mom.FEMALE_1:	When did this happen for both of you?Leon Wathethiors:	Well, mine was last week. Two weeks ago or last week.Nicanor Garcia:	When with my parents? When did what happen exactly?Leon Wathethiors:	Because they would thought so high of me and then after smoking, they just dropped everything. I felt like I was human, it wasn't perfect.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah. When it happened to me, I don't know, I always think my parents always knew, had an idea of what I did. But for sure, for sure this summer, they know what I do now. They know that I party and they know that I go out all they could do is tell me, ""Be careful."" Because they can't really tell me anything else. They could, but I'm going to listen and I'm going to respect their opinion but at the same time I'm still going and do what I do.FEMALE_1:	How did they find out this summer?Nicanor Garcia:	I got busted with alcohol in my room and my dad just talked to me about it. The thing is that they see that I do what I do, I party and I do all that. I came home with black eyes and stuff but I still continue to do my work and I still continue to stay on that track that we talk about.Leon Wathethiors:	So the getting busted. What did that do for you?Nicanor Garcia:	What did that do for me?Leon Wathethiors:	Because I know for me, I didn't lose respect for my parents, but I just felt like, if they would have known the whole time.Nicanor Garcia:	Like fear or guilt. You lost fear or guilt?Leon Wathethiors:	It hurt when my mom, my dad were like, these people are now above you. Never once in my life. They always tell me, ""You're above everybody else, you're not like anybody."" Once the words came out of his mouth, he's like, ""All these are now above you."" I don't know, and then, he even told me, ""I didn't lose trust in you."" He's like, ""Do you want me to give you one more chance? "" I was just like, I don't know, it hurts.Nicanor Garcia:	One more chance for what or like, what do you want from me?Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	I think, I went through all this when I was 15. Now it's easing up on me. But now I see the same thing going on.Leon Wathethiors:	With me, and it helped me through a lot though too. Because even stuff I tell you and anybody else, sometimes I forget to live by that.Nicanor Garcia:	Sometimes you forget who you are until something happens and you remind yourself.Leon Wathethiors:	I feel like the whole situation when easier too, because they've been in denial this whole time. Was at the summer, my brother found beer pong balls in the room, and he told my mom, and my mom was just, ""Oh, well, you guys shouldn't be drinking."" [00:25:00] You guys are too young and they always joke around me, but they're never serious when I leave on the weekends ""Hi, no beer pong. But I know they're serious but they don't take it seriously. Then when something little happens, they want to just come down on me. I guess I understand now because every other situation that's led up to that problem, it's just weighing on them and they felt like they got let it on me, and at the time, I'm just like, ""Really bedtime?"" It all built up. They were scared to let me grow up, and now when they see this stuff.Nicanor Garcia:	Now they're really scared?Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	They were scared to see you grow up and now that you're grown-up, they're scared. They don't know what do.FEMALE_1:	You mentioned the word problem, you were talking about the stuff like it's a problem. Do you think it's a problem?Nicanor Garcia:	How?Leon Wathethiors:	I don't think it's a problem, but I know it's not right. I know we shouldn't be doing things we do.Nicanor Garcia:	A problem, something l call it anonymous problem. But I don't think it's that. I think this is more of a social scene. I could do without drinking, I don't need drinking in my life.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah.Nicanor Garcia:	We were even talking about, why did we even drink?FEMALE_1:	Why?Leon Wathethiors:	I don't know?Nicanor Garcia:	We were asking each other the same question.Leon Wathethiors:	I can answer that question. I have fun all the time, just hanging with friends. I don't know, why do we need alcohol?Nicanor Garcia:	I don't know. We don't.Leon Wathethiors:	Is it because of you hanging out with me? Because honestly I don't feel like it's like that either, because even as I was talking to Joey the other day, she's like, ""Why do we play beer pong? No one likes it.Nicanor Garcia:	I don't like playing, but it's whack.Leon Wathethiors:	It's fun at a time.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah.Leon Wathethiors:	It's fun.Nicanor Garcia:	It's like something due.Leon Wathethiors:	So is basketball.Nicanor Garcia:	Yes.Leon Wathethiors:	You know what I'm saying? Like why can't we do other things?.Nicanor Garcia:	What else do we do at 3 o'clock in the morning? You know what I'm saying? What are we going to do? Play basketball, or go to the movies or something?Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah. I think we just use that as a way just to get everybody together.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah, I think it's a social thing.Leon Wathethiors:	Just like, we are trying to sing a music. This will be our new.Nicanor Garcia:	A new thing?Leon Wathethiors:	Like our new outlet.Nicanor Garcia:	It was, music was my outlet for a while. That's when I really got confused, not confused, but that's when my mentalities really started crashing down on me. I didn't know who I was for a minute. So my auntie sings, and she records some songs and then I started writing lyrics and I would record with her, and we still do sometimes. But there was a time like of six month period where every weekend I'd go to my grandma's house and just hang out with my auntie and just record, or work on music, or write, or just even talk. Sometimes we go out and we'd slack, but that was just because we didn't want to be trapped in a room all day. But at that point is when I was like, so I'm gang banger, but really I'm not a gang banger.Leon Wathethiors:	You're titled as that.Nicanor Garcia:	I'm titled a gang banger, but if you really know me, I'm not the stereotype gang banger. I'm a good student and others not, they were like, the pressures of both lives. It was like, which way? I don't know which pressure do I take off? Of course people are going to think, oh, it's a easy decision go with the good way, but at the same time it's like, which I do I want to go?Leon Wathethiors:	It's easy decision, but it's not.Nicanor Garcia:	It's not easy thing to do.Leon Wathethiors:	It's not easy route. It'll be so much easier just following the pressure.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah, there you go.Leon Wathethiors:	So much easier.Nicanor Garcia:	It's an easy decision to make in your head, but it's not an easy decision to live by. Them working it'd be ways you're going to make money the way that I used to.FEMALE_1:	How's that?Nicanor Garcia:	I used to sell drugs here and there, but I didn't get too deep into it because I had seen what it did to the rest of my family.FEMALE_1:	What did it do?Nicanor Garcia:	Well, I used to look up to my uncle Paco a lot, and my uncle Paco is now like [00:30:00] 30. When he was in high school, he was making thousands of dollars a week. I seen that and I was like, ""He is making money. Isn't that what everybody wants to do? Is that why people go to college?Leon Wathethiors:	It's hard. Even we see all our friends. How many drug dealer friends do we have? They're all rolling around always in money. They say, ""That's what we're going to college for, we're going to college for money."" That's them. I hate that. Society runs like that, like, money what's money.FEMALE_1:	Is that why you want to go to college?Nicanor Garcia:	Mainly.Leon Wathethiors:	I don't want to be stuck with something that I don't want to be doing for the rest of my life.Nicanor Garcia:	I see college as an investment in yourself but at the same time it's like an experience, it's knowledge. I don't know.Leon Wathethiors:	I don't like how colleges break it down. Teachers come up to me like, ""You should do engineering.""Nicanor Garcia:	They make a lot of money.Leon Wathethiors:	They make so much money, you should go to college for business and check out this school. There's a quote from Harold and Kumar and he says, ""Just because you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you have to make porn."" It's a funny quote. But I thought about it that just because I'm good at math doesn't mean I want to go into engineering or mathematics. I love music, I love video production. That's what I want to do.Nicanor Garcia:	Right now, I'm stuck between what's better for my future and what I want to do.Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly.Nicanor Garcia:	I see myself going into business as in for what's better.Leon Wathethiors:	For what's better, as a quote ""better.""Nicanor Garcia:	For better or a lot of opportunities are just not, but at the same time, I enjoy music, I enjoy writing, I enjoy a lot of other things but when it comes to business, it's a bore. It's like, I'm doing this for better of my future but when am I going to stop looking in the future and live in the present?Leon Wathethiors:	Exactly. I feel like we're living in the present now and that's what people are looking at us. That's why parents see us like, ""What are you doing?""Nicanor Garcia:	""You've got your whole life ahead of you."" It's cool. I got my future handled but I still got to live in my present, I still got to handle my present.Leon Wathethiors:	I don't think they understand how hard we work at school because there's one time my mom tells me, we're in the car and my brother tells me, ""You need to start washing dishes and doing laundry and all that."" I just sat and take it. Then ""Why? I go to school all day?"" They were like we went to school too, we did all this. We went through 12 years of school too. I just sat there and I didn't say anything. You know what they did? The next day my mom came up to me and she told me, outside for said, we did go to school but no one's doing it like you doing.Nicanor Garcia:	Damn, see, I never looked at it like that because my mom would always tell me this and that. Take out the trash, do your chores but they're not chores.Leon Wathethiors:	It's out of respect.Nicanor Garcia:	Yeah, out of respect. I live in your house so I'm going to pull my own too. My mom doesn't do anything for me anymore, I don't even eat at home anymore, and when I do, I make my own food. I pretty much maintain my room and maintain my stuff and if I see they need help here and there I will help them but, I forgot where I was going with this.FEMALE_1:	You mentioned pressure and it sounds like both of you are under pressure, what do you do to cope with it?Nicanor Garcia:	Have fun, forget.Leon Wathethiors:	Yogurtland.Nicanor Garcia:	What do we do? We talk, we hang out.Leon Wathethiors:	We do this.FEMALE_1:	Do you want to talk about how you met and about your friendship?Nicanor Garcia:	First day at school, well, for me.Leon Wathethiors:	Came to Kaiser.Nicanor Garcia:	After, I went to school in the north side I moved down here towards this way, down [00:35:00] Southern Denver. I went to Kaiser Elementary and my first day of fourth grade there, I was the new kid, I was just standing there and then, a group of kids come up to me.Leon Wathethiors:	The crew.Nicanor Garcia:	They're like, ""Hey, do you cuss?"" I was like, ""Well, yeah. Who doesn't cuss?""Leon Wathethiors:	I know, who doesn't curse in fourth grade?Nicanor Garcia:	Then they're like, ""Prove it. "" I looked at one of our friends that we still talk to today.Leon Wathethiors:	The bully, he was the bully.Nicanor Garcia:	The bully, I was like, ""You're a bitch."" Everybody's like, ""Cool. Yeah."" Then ever since then, we were hanging out.Leon Wathethiors:	Fourth grade, fifth grade.Nicanor Garcia:	Those are the best years of my life.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah. fifth grade, definitely best in my life. I don't remember having any-Nicanor Garcia:	Pressure or stress, any responsibility. You just live day by day, fun by fun.Leon Wathethiors:	There's so much that we used to do like fall asleep in class. We used to ditch in class, we used to get the bean bags and hide them under the chair and make like little tents.Nicanor Garcia:	We used to hide in the class.Leon Wathethiors:	In the back of the class.Nicanor Garcia:	Times went by quick.FEMALE_1:	What about your friendship now, how do you feel about it now?Nicanor Garcia:	Our friends? Leon's like a brother to me honestly.Leon Wathethiors:	Get closer, I'm close with you than I'm with any of my brothers.Nicanor Garcia:	I mentioned before, whatever about being a gang banger or whatever but I don't trust any of them like I trust my friends; my close friends like Leon. My family, some of them were my cousins. It's a close friendship, I guess. It's trust.Leon Wathethiors:	That's one thing that it's hard for me to trust. I have such bad trust issues. I don't want to say I don't trust my mom but it's almost a point where I don't rely on anybody.Nicanor Garcia:	You can't rely on anybody.Leon Wathethiors:	There's very few people I trust and that's you, Joseph, Mario, of course, my mom and my dad. That's just the few people that I can think of right now.Nicanor Garcia:	For me, it would be you, Joseph, Mario, my auntie Angie. I want to say, that's it.Leon Wathethiors:	Trust issues.FEMALE_1:	You mentioned you both feeling you're stuck between burying identity and burying past for your future, if you had to, in vision even in two, three, four years from now, what do you see?Nicanor Garcia:	I see myself out of university two-three years. Four years myself, but as far as giving myself a label. I am who I am, I think about it, and I forget sometimes that my mentality on things. I felt a lot better after I thought, ""I don't have to label myself, I am who I am."" I fall under both categories but don't put me in a category, to begin with.Leon Wathethiors:	Yeah, exactly. Don't put a title on me.Nicanor Garcia:	Talking about it and reminding myself about it, makes me feel a whole lot better.Leon Wathethiors:	As far as for me, I want to say, the perfect feature I know, I would love to be in the NBA, I see myself in the NBA. That's how I want to see myself, I want see myself in the NBA making millions. That's how I want to see myself, even if it doesn't I still see myself happy, either directionally go for the making music or whatever I do, I see myself happy with all my close friends.Nicanor Garcia:	Family and close friends, it's all you have in this world and yourself.Leon Wathethiors:	Yogurtland.FEMALE_1:	Is there anything else you want to ask each other or talk about?Nicanor Garcia:	Where are we going for lunch?Leon Wathethiors:	Yogurtland. I was asked this question a couple weeks ago, and it was, what's your purpose?Nicanor Garcia:	What's my purpose?Leon Wathethiors:	What do you feel like your purpose is?Nicanor Garcia:	My purpose, how are you going to asked me that with one minute left?Leon Wathethiors:	If you can, just sum it up.FEMALE_1:	Take your time.Leon Wathethiors:	Sum it up. We were supposed to sum it up in one phrase what our purpose was and I answered, [00:40:00] I'm destined.Nicanor Garcia:	That's what I was going to say.Leon Wathethiors:	I'm destined for success.Nicanor Garcia:	I'm destined to be who I'm going to be, I'm destined to be me, that's my purpose. Whoever that is, I don't know yet but that's who I'm destined to be. Pretty much, I make that choice, whoever I am.Leon Wathethiors:	That's what I mean, that's the mentality. Do everything for you, don't let anything affect you. In the end you are the one that controls your mentalities. Sometimes it's hard to realize that people get to you.Nicanor Garcia:	Sometimes you get stuck and sometimes you forget and you just have to think about it and remind yourself; who you are, what you're about.Leon Wathethiors:	Where you're going.Nicanor Garcia:	Where you're going.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

When did you really learn to cook?Virginia Martinez:	My mother.Levi Mays:	Okay. She just taught you?Virginia Martinez:	Also my father.

Ever since I was very young, it's my favorite color. I looked at it as a sexy color, so I dressed mostly in black, and I still do. Then follows red, burgundy. I think those are my favorite colors.Levi Mays:	Grandma, you and grandpa Ben got a divorce. What age was my uncle Jophy, would you say?Virginia Martinez:	Jophy was about 16.Levi Mays:	Okay. So my uncle Luis was about 15, right, and my mom around 14?Virginia Martinez:	No, your mom comes second to Jophy.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. She's in between Jophy and Luis.Levi Mays:	You had two boys and two girls?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. In the right half sets; boy, girl, boy, girl.Levi Mays:	Yeah. How was it after the divorce? Did you take all of them?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah.Levi Mays:	That must have been hard raising them?Virginia Martinez:	I think I mistook your question as to when we got divorced and when we got separated. We didn't get divorced until about ten years after we were separated.Levi Mays:	When you got separated you took the four kids? My uncle Jophy was 16 then?Virginia Martinez:	No.Levi Mays:	He was six then?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah, he was really young. He was in the third grade.Levi Mays:	That must have been really hard raising them?Virginia Martinez:	It was.Levi Mays:	You raised them all by yourself?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. For the most part, yeah.FEMALE_2:	Do you want to talk a little bit about that decision to become separated?Virginia Martinez:	The marriage wasn't working. I don't know that I want to go into the gory details.FEMALE_2:	What was that like then, being responsible, like you said, for all these young children afterwards when you were the primary provider for them? What was that like for you?Virginia Martinez:	It was a challenge but I knew I had to tackle it. I had to be the provider as well as the mother and father and disciplinarian and the teacher of everything.Levi Mays:	Grandma, you like to cook but you don't really like to bake, right?Virginia Martinez:	I don't like baking.Levi Mays:	Why is that?Virginia Martinez:	It's one of the things I don't like. I just don't have an interest in.Levi Mays:	I see. You told me one time a story, do you remember that story?Virginia Martinez:	That's how I learned to make cookies?Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	Back in them days, you didn't say no to your parents when they asked you to do something, and I did, because I didn't like sweets. I wasn't a sweet-eater. Then my mother asked me to make some cookies, which we call in Spanish biscochitos. She told me one day to make some, and I said, ""No I don't like them. I don't want to make any."" Them days we used to have to wash dishes in a pan. We had two pans, one for the dish to wash and one to rinse. They were pretty big. For me saying no, she made me make the dough in that big pan of biscochitos, and it took me three days to make them.Levi Mays:	Really?Virginia Martinez:	To finish cooking them. All day long. She said, ""You are going to do it until you finish it for saying no"". I learned how to make those. That stuck.Levi Mays:	Yeah.FEMALE_2:	Did you ever make them after that?Virginia Martinez:	I did. I made them more with time and the kids liked them. [00:15:00] That's what I got for saying no.Levi Mays:	Grandma, what did you used to do? Where did you work when you were raising all my uncles and aunts?Virginia Martinez:	In the beginning, I had to go to Social Service, right?Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	I did not want to be dependent on Social Service, so I took training as CNA.Levi Mays:	What's that?Virginia Martinez:	Certified Nurse's Aide. I did that and got off that welfare and I taught my kids to never depend if you're able to go to work and keep on your own feet, on your own merit to live.Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	They said it was going to be hard. I told them they had to help whatever we could do to make money as stay off the map. Each one had to pitch in to still be able to survive and stay out on our own and not have anybody on your back. I never liked having somebody controlling me.Levi Mays:	Grandma, you guys moved after you and my grandpa separated, right?Virginia Martinez:	Moved?Levi Mays:	You moved to Denver. Because he stayed in Pagosa Springs.Virginia Martinez:	No. We moved over here. Your grandpa worked at Eisenhower tunnel. There was a time when they were doing the Eisenhower tunnel, so he worked there building that Eisenhower tunnel and then we moved over here, he wanted to move over here. That was in '69.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	Katrina was about eight months old or nine months old.Levi Mays:	Okay. When did they start getting in high school? What high school did they start in?Virginia Martinez:	Your Uncle Drophy and Christine, they went to East High. Luis went there for a little while too, I think. Then we moved. We bought a house with your Grandpa Rene. We bought a house over here on Cornell. Your Uncle Drophy was doing the two high schools, East and Lincoln.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	Then Christine, I think she did the same. Luis and Katrina went also to Lincoln High.Levi Mays:	So do you remember anything super special about them? Did they do a lot of extracurricular activities or anything like that? Were they really social or any?Virginia Martinez:	They did a lot of school work. They did a lot, and plus they worked.Levi Mays:	They worked too?Virginia Martinez:	They worked too. Yes, they did a lot of extra schoolwork. They took trips. They had student exchanges from Mexico.Levi Mays:	They were really involved in school?Virginia Martinez:	They were involved in school, yeah.Levi Mays:	So you always pushed them to finish high school, right?Virginia Martinez:	Yes, and I did not allow them to date until they finished high school.Levi Mays:	I didn't know that.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. They were not allowed to date. They were allowed to have friends or go out on a date or something that's on a special occasion. But they had to focus on their school and their job.Levi Mays:	Okay.FEMALE_1:	Where did they work?Virginia Martinez:	They worked at janitorial. I think Christine worked in an office, can't remember it. It was in the same building.Levi Mays:	Was it for my Aunt Sophie?Virginia Martinez:	No. It was at the Denver Club Building.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	I think we all worked there.Levi Mays:	You guys all worked there together?Virginia Martinez:	I worked there. Yeah.Levi Mays:	That's pretty cool.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah.Levi Mays:	[00:20:00] So you pushed them to finish high school but you never really pushed them to go to college, did you?Virginia Martinez:	No, I figured that was their decision. That would have to be their decision to make up. I told them they needed to go get more education, but the one I was in control of was the high school, getting their education. Then from there.FEMALE_1:	Why was that such an important thing to you? That they finish high school?Virginia Martinez:	Because I was allowed to quit school in the seventh grade because at that time, that's when my mother and my father separated. I don't think that they looked at education as the best means to get by in life, that's going to help you. It wasn't as important as it is now.Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	It wasn't demanding.Levi Mays:	So about what time did you marry my Grandpa Rene?Virginia Martinez:	I married your Grandpa Rene in '79.Levi Mays:	Okay. When did Grandpa Simon pass away?Virginia Martinez:	He passed away in 1995.Levi Mays:	So I was born by then.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah.Levi Mays:	I was just barely born. I do remember them. I remember my grandma, I'll say Grandma Sadie.Virginia Martinez:	You remember her?Levi Mays:	She had her little dog, Cricket.Virginia Martinez:	No, that was your Grandma Eva.Levi Mays:	That's right.Virginia Martinez:	That was my mom.Levi Mays:	I remember Grandma Eva, and she had a little dog, Cricket. She lived where you live now, right?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. That was her house.Levi Mays:	So, did she own it?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. She owned it.Levi Mays:	Okay. Did she live there for a while?Virginia Martinez:	She lived there 10 years, maybe a little longer. But I would say 10 years.Levi Mays:	What did you guys have to eat way back when? Because you guys really had to cook back then. You guys really didn't have pre-made stuff, did you?Virginia Martinez:	In my childhood?Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	No, we didn't. There was no hamburgers. Well, there was hamburgers, but only in the restaurants and people didn't go to the restaurants very much. We had wheat. Okay, we had farm, so we had chicken, we had pig, we had cows, we had sheep and lamb, and then when they go hunting, there was deer. So we had big variety, and then in the farm, they planted a lot of vegetables in there. I'm sure you've been to the farm that was ours.Levi Mays:	I don't remember. I remember you guys had land in Utah though for a while.Virginia Martinez:	It's still there. But this is when we were small.Levi Mays:	So, about when did you get your land in Utah?Virginia Martinez:	We got the land in Utah in 1995. November of 1995.Levi Mays:	You had two more kids by then. So that was my Aunt Baby and Uncle Leno, right?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	Leno is older than Rene. Which we call Baby. She used the Baby.Levi Mays:	You had those with Grandpa Rene, I mean?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah.Levi Mays:	He helped you raise them?Virginia Martinez:	He helped me raise.Levi Mays:	Aunt Baby and -- Well, did he help raise with all of them?Virginia Martinez:	He helped. He was there for all of my kids. Yeah.Levi Mays:	Okay.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. He helped.Levi Mays:	So, by the time they were born, Uncle Jophy was about out of high school, right?Virginia Martinez:	Well, I think he had a couple of years to go.Levi Mays:	You had plenty of kids ranging from plenty years?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah, I had, but I was never disappointed. I had three sets, boy, girl, boy, girl, boy, girl.Levi Mays:	You guys had a restaurant in Utah, [00:25:00] right?Virginia Martinez:	Yes.Levi Mays:	How did that work out?Virginia Martinez:	It was doing pretty good. But then your Grandpa Rene's dad got sick with cancer, so he had to come and help. Then me and Jophy were left trying to take care of the restaurant. Then your grandpa got sick. So we had to come. Then your grandpa passed away.Levi Mays:	Yeah, about 2000?Virginia Martinez:	Two thousand.Levi Mays:	He had a heart attack?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah, he had a massive heart attack. But my mom, your grandma, she passed away five months before your grandpa.Levi Mays:	Okay. So you've had a pretty long hard life.Virginia Martinez:	But it's been interesting, and I would not say it was all that hard because it was a struggle at times.Levi Mays:	Just kept pushing through it.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah, and tackled it. Always look ways to tackle it, and get it behind, and keep on going.Levi Mays:	What do you like to do now, grandma?Virginia Martinez:	I'm busy all the time.Levi Mays:	You always say busy. I know you like to play cards and do crosswords, right?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. But that's when my time is. Like in the evening, I do my work. I work outside in the yard, I do anything.Levi Mays:	Yeah. You do a lot of work. You work so hard. You just keep going.Virginia Martinez:	That's what keeps me going. That's what keeps me interesting. I'm interested in doing a lot.Levi Mays:	You've done so much. In the house that's next door that you own, you've totally remodeled that place.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah, and your Uncle Jophy --Levi Mays:	Yeah.Virginia Martinez:	did a lot of work, or the heavier work.Levi Mays:	You do so much, though, grandma, it's crazy. Because every time I see you, you're always cleaning or cooking or doing something. I just always see you working hard.Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. I don't give myself a chance to get bored. If I have to sit for a long time, I get bored. I just get up, and get going.Levi Mays:	Which just seems so crazy because you kind of not like a big person. It's just crazy. Because it seems like you'd be tired and exhausted. But I never see you tired.Virginia Martinez:	I'm more tired when I'm not doing anything. I think that's why I keep going because I feel more tired. But when I'm doing something, I feel I'm accomplishing something.Levi Mays:	Yeah. Okay.Virginia Martinez:	I got it done.FEMALE_1:	What is your favorite thing to do?Virginia Martinez:	My favorite thing as far as work or hobby?FEMALE_1:	Both.Virginia Martinez:	Both? I like to do cleaning, I like to decorate my house, take it apart and put it back together, and as well as the yard. As far as hobby, my best hobby is when I have time, I turn on my speaker and my microphone and I stand there and sing. As far as a hobby is work, I do flower arranging and some other crafts that I do but mostly the flower arranging.Levi Mays:	So you're bilingual, right, grandma? You speak Spanish and English?Virginia Martinez:	Yes, I speak both.Levi Mays:	So you speak in both really fluently?Virginia Martinez:	Yes.Levi Mays:	Another thing I noticed about you is that you're really kind. You open your home to so many people.Virginia Martinez:	Yes. I learned that from my parents and especially my mom and I had the opportunity to experience it. She always said, but always in Spanish. I don't know if I can translate it, it would sound the same. She said, ""Never pay attention who you help, who you're helping.""Levi Mays:	Like never judge?Virginia Martinez:	Who [00:30:00] you are giving a helping hand and you don't need to expect to get it back from that person. She says because you will get the help and you will not even know where it came from or who it was that gave you that help. And I experienced it in many times and found that it was true. Anybody needs help, I say, ""Well, maybe they can't help me back or do it in the same manner, but somebody else will come along and help me maybe in another way.""Levi Mays:	Yeah. What's the proudest moment of your life, grandma?Virginia Martinez:	Huh?Levi Mays:	What's the proudest moment of your life?Virginia Martinez:	The proudest moment of my life was when I only went to the seventh grade and at that time the teaching was much better than it is as the years progressed.Levi Mays:	It is?Virginia Martinez:	At that time, an eighth grade education was like a high school education.Levi Mays:	Really? I didn't know that.Virginia Martinez:	A high school education was like a college education.Levi Mays:	Wow.Virginia Martinez:	But I was not proud of the education that I got. When I accomplished my CNA, I think I had accomplished something in my education.Levi Mays:	So, how come you never went back to school?Virginia Martinez:	I was too busy. I was too busy raising kids.Levi Mays:	I can imagine.Virginia Martinez:	And trying to keep them going, maybe.Levi Mays:	Yes. How are you doing now, grandma?Virginia Martinez:	It's hard. Now it's getting harder because of the recession and things are going up so high that your money doesn't go anywhere.Levi Mays:	Yes.Virginia Martinez:	But before the recession, I was not rich, but enough to pay my bills and stuff.Levi Mays:	You have so much stuff, grandma. How have you accumulated all of it?Virginia Martinez:	It is not that it's so much stuff, it's that I got a small house.Levi Mays:	Did you just pick it up over the years?Virginia Martinez:	Yeah. A lot of them is birthday gifts and Christmas gifts and a lot of those knick-knacks. A lot of them I haven't even opened because the kids, they buy me stuff.Levi Mays:	Yeah. How many people are living with you now?Virginia Martinez:	Jophy, Denise his wife, and Katrina and her two daughters, and Leno, your uncle Leno.Levi Mays:	Do any of them have jobs or do you work for all of them kind of?Virginia Martinez:	Well, it's hard for them to find -- Your uncle Jophy --.Levi Mays:	Uncle Jophy can't work, because --Virginia Martinez:	He is very sick. It's a wonder that he learned to push himself. He does a lot in the condition that he is in.Levi Mays:	He's got a couple of heart attacks, right?FEMALE_1:	He's sick. What is he sick with?Virginia Martinez:	He has RSD. I don't know if you're familiar.Levi Mays:	It's something with your knee, right? So it's inflamed pretty much, all the time.Virginia Martinez:	Yes. It's a progressing disease to where now he's on a part-time wheel chair. It's got to do with his nerves, the electrical part of the -- He has to take medication, pain pills every six hours. That happened pretty close after high school.Levi Mays:	Because he became a mechanic and an engine fell on his knee?Virginia Martinez:	No. He twisted his knee in the job. And then with the surgery, they didn't do good surgery so he developed RSD.Levi Mays:	Wow, I didn't know that.Virginia Martinez:	But he still keeps on going, and he still keeps helping me.Levi Mays:	Yeah. So, [00:35:00] what are all your other kids working on?Virginia Martinez:	What are they working on? I don't know where your mom works but she is in financing at WorldVenture.Levi Mays:	Well, let me ask a better question, grandma, what's your goal?Virginia Martinez:	My goal?Levi Mays:	Yes. What do you keep pushing for?Virginia Martinez:	At this point in life, just to be there, to keep on doing whatever I have to do.Levi Mays:	You're doing everything, though. It's crazy. It seems like.Virginia Martinez:	That's what keeps you going.Levi Mays:	I see.FEMALE_1:	Do you want to tell your grandmother what you admire about her the most?Levi Mays:	There's so many things I admire about you, grandma. You're just so kind, and you're always working. You're the hardest working person I know, and your knowledgeable. You're so wise because everything you tell us, your wisdom is amazing. I want to thank you for that.Virginia Martinez:	I listened to older people while I was young and their advice, and I don't know if you would call them riddles, but like I said, sayings that will get you through life.Levi Mays:	Okay.Levi Mays:	Well, I want to thank you for your time with me grandma.Virginia Martinez:	I appreciate you for having me.Levi Mays:	Thanks for taking time off your day.Virginia Martinez:	I'm glad you did. Yeah, I enjoyed it.Levi Mays:	I'm glad you came.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
mby008510,"Marlena Angle:	[00:00:00] Hi. My name is Marlena Angle. I'm 27. Today is October 27, 2011. We're here in Aurora, Colorado and I am talking with Sylvia and Jose. I was Sylvia's son Jordan and her daughter, Odalys' fourth-grade teacher.Silvia Marquez:	Buenos días, my name is Silvia Marquez tengo 37 años de edad. Estamos aquí en Aurora Colorado. El día de hoy es Octubre 27 de 2011. Y La razón que estoy aquí es porque vamos a tener una conversación acerca de las visitas a casa con la maestra de mis hijos.Jose:	Mi nombre es José Garcia, yo soy parte del tráfico seguros, donde conocí a Silvia. Hoy es el 27 de Octubre y estamos en Aurora Colorado. I think the first question I want to come up with is how did you all come up with this home visit stuff? What was the first initiative to try to bring a teacher home?Marlena Angle:	I believe Sylvia and the PTO got together and as the parents they decided that this is a program that they were interested in trying to bridge the gap between the parents and the teachers at the school, especially since there is a huge language barrier with most of the families and the teachers in our school.Jose:	How has this been working for you so far?Marlena Angle:	Last year was my first year that I did the home visits and I'd previously already known Sylvia. I had Odalys the year before in my class, and so we knew each other from that. But when Jordan was in my class, we had the opportunity to do the home visits, and so I was able to go to their house and get to know their family more on a personal level rather than just at conferences talking about academics.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	This is right. She said, us by working with the Traffic and Safety Committee and working with Mario from the Denver Foundation.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Then Mario came out with a video that said that we could probably bring this to our schools. They've tried this, I think in California? It was in California that he brought this from. He went to a seminar in California and brought this idea to Denver and said that we could probably apply this to our schools. We decided to start with the Peoria as a pilot program.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	We started looking at the video. We started talking with parents and teachers, and we started to try to come up with something as far as home visits.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Then the principal went over to the teachers and asked them, it wasn't really a volunteer service, but it was a way below what they expected to get paid for it. He wanted to know if they were interested in going to the home visits and stuff. It was like some people said yes, some people said no.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	We've also applied ourselves for a grant. We came came up with $3,000 worth of grant fund from the Denver Foundation.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	This was a reward type of thing for the teachers and the translators to go on these home visits, and it was a way of paying them back.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	And thats when... ¿Como así? ¿Cómo se llama la señora?Silvia Marquez:	Miss Angle.Jose:	Yeah, Miss Angle [00:05:00] decided that she was going to volunteer and send her a letter stating the fact that she was going to be having a home visit with her.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She was a little bit nervous in receiving the letter, but she didn't really know how far she wanted to get to know us.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	I'm thinking that she had the same feelings towards me.Marlena Angle:	Yeah. As a teacher especially in a school where there is a huge language barrier, it's nervous in the fact that you have to go, you want to meet the families, but you have to bring a translator so that you can understand each other. You're hoping that everything's getting translated correctly. I had never visited students' homes before, so it was a new experience for me as well.Jose:	(speaking Spanish).Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She said her kid was nervous too. She said he knew she going to come visit, but he kept asking this question, ""why she's coming home?""FEMALE_1:	(speaking Spanish). How was that first home visit to your house?Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She said the first visit went smooth. To start with, we started off nervous, but after we started talking with each other, stuff like that, it started to smoothing up. Towards the end, it was a pretty good visit.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Then she wanted to know how many people are living in the house and then she started talking about her son, what they were expecting from him.  What their son was asking questions about the teacher, why was she here, what did she want to know? They want to know how many people she got in her family. They got to know each other as far as what size of family again.Marlena Angle:	Yeah. It was fun for me to get to know a little bit more about Sylvia and her husband and how they grew up and their educational experiences.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Marlena Angle:	Then in return, what they had hopes and dreams for in regards to Jordan and Odalys, even though Jordan was in my class at that time.Jose:	(speaking Spanish). What do you think is the most you've gotten out of this experience so far?Marlena Angle:	I think that from this experience, it's just been developing a relationship and feeling more comfortable.Jose:	Okay. (speaking Spanish).Marlena Angle:	I felt more comfortable approaching Sylvia about a concern I would notice about Jordan in the class or just to update her about something that was happening, and I think that she felt the same.Jose:	(speaking [00:10:00] Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	It made it easier to translate what problems her kid was having with her teachers, stuff like that. He would come home sad. He would come home not really into his homework or whatever. Then she could ask the teacher directly, ""Okay, what's happening with Jordan, why is he feeling like that?"" That way they had a better communication with her kid, and it was resolved quicker.Marlena Angle:	Yeah. Even now, even though Jordan nor Dallas are no longer in my class, because they're growing up and getting older, you still see them and you have that personal connection. So you can quickly ask how things are and touch base with one another.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She thinks that you're building a better relationship between you and a kid, because during a conference, it's just a 15 minute conference and hardly anything comes out of them in conferences besides, ""Okay, how's he doing grade wise? Does he need help on this? Does he need help on that?"" But you don't really get to the general problem or you don't have enough time to ask the questions that you want to ask. At home, you get a little bit more time, it's more leisure.Marlena Angle:	I agree. Also, after the home visit those future conferences are a lot easier because we've built that relationship. So even though it's only 15 minutes, it's a lot more productive in the sense that-Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Marlena Angle:	The students see that their parents and teacher are communicating more than just that once at conferences. So they are a little bit more proactive in their attempts in school and what not.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She said that her kid has a better relationship with her teacher now, and she sees not only in him but she gives  more time for kids now. She has more time for all of them. Well, before she might not quite understand all of them. Now she has a better understanding of them, I think.FEMALE_1:	Marlene, I have a question for you. How do you think doing these home visits has changed you as a teacher?Marlena Angle:	How do I want to say this? I realized that as a teacher sometimes you get really caught up in just the academics and making sure the students [00:15:00] are learning what they're supposed to learn in. You often times forget that they have a personal life outside of school. So these home visits have really helped me as a teacher remember that students have more going on in their lives than just school. So I am able to adjust my teaching and get to know the students better. In turn, they do learn better.Jose:	(speaking Spanish). I got to know that too, out of all this, the whole time that you've been doing this program, what is the one thing that you think you might have learnt more, out of everything you've learnt? What does the one thing that sticks out?Marlena Angle:	I've always thought that as a teacher and as parents, we want the same for the student. But it's just reaffirmed that we are on the same page. We want the same things for the students. It's when you do the home visits, it reaffirms that. Then you know for sure you are on the same page.Jose:	(speaking Spanish). What do you think is the future of this program? I mean, how far do you think this is going to go?Marlena Angle:	I think it all depends. We're just getting it started for this year. I think a lot of the same teachers who participated last year are participating. I'm not sure if there's more teachers participating. It's very beneficial to do the home visits, but it is a time commitment.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	You see there's other parents that had been interested in these programs, so why only her kid, and not mine?Marlena Angle:	I think from the teacher's perspective is that sometimes it becomes difficult. Like for me, I don't have a family yet. I don't have to go home.Jose:	Make dinner.Marlena Angle:	Make dinner and do homework with my kids and all of that stuff, so it's easier for me.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Marlena Angle:	I think that a lot more teachers are very interested in the program. They're just still trying to figure out how to balance their home life with their school life.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Marlena Angle:	I think this would be the second year and hopefully those other teachers will start to see [00:20:00] that it is a time commitment, but it's only one or two hours a week and the benefits from it they're just incredible in the classroom.Jose:	(speaking Spanish).Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Now she says she's a little bit more outspoken. She wouldn't go directly to a teacher or something like that or complain about what educational process was going on with her kid. Now, she has more confidence to go talk with her teachers. Even in middle school, her oldest daughter is in middle school now and she has the confidence to go directly to the teacher and talk to her and discuss no matter about the language barrier, whatever, that doesn't stop. Now, she can go straight to a teacher and actually question point-blank. While before she might not have that courage to do that.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)I asked her the same question I asked you, what is the most you getting out of this program. She's saying that now she has a more courage to come up to even a principal and ask questions if it pertains to her kid. While before she might not have the courage to ask that question. Now she's a little bit more open with the teachers. She's able to ask more questions and get more out of them by having that communication, the barrier is broken. So now she comes directly to the teacher, talk directly to principals when she has problems with her kid.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Another thing too is tearing up barriers between other parents and teachers too, because she goes out to all the parents and says, don't be scared to ask your teacher anything if it pertains to your kid. So you should be more open with your teacher. Be able to speak with her more direct and get more out of her by having that communication.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Parents they come to her and ask her, what teacher would you recommend for my kid and she always recommends you.  .Marlena Angle:	Thank you. It's so nice. I think I like this because I get to see the parent's perspective. As a teacher, I'm always saying like, how do we get parents to be more advocates for their children and now I can say, well, this home visits program is one of the ways that we can get parents to be more involved in their children's education and advocates for it.Jose:	[00:25:00] (speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Then because of this, what's her name, again?FEMALE_1:	Miss Angle.Jose:	Yeah, Miss Angle decided to put her kid into a special program that really helped him out and he's doing real good at school because of that. She got to the point to where she knew what he needed, but I think it was probably because of the home visits, not so much the encompasses at school. They brought that out and decide, well, this is what program we need to put him in. So far it's helped him out.Marlena Angle:	One of the things that as we've been building this relationship as a teacher, you always wonder like, ""How is that kid doing? How is this kid doing?"" I'm hoping that this has built relationship where even when Jordan is gone and she no longer has kids at the school, they'll still come back and tell me like how they're doing or keep me up to date.Jose:	(speaking Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She said that her daughter, which was in your class before Jordan, says that she still loves you very much. She stills yells at or screams at you when she's you in the streets and she does recognize you. You were one of her favorite teachers.Marlena Angle:	That is a funny story to tell. It was the 4th of July and I was walking across the street to go watch fireworks and they happen to be driving and Dallas is screaming at the window, yelling. So that was fun.Jose:	That makes you feel good though, for somebody to recognize you like that.Marlena Angle:	Yeah.Jose:	So far as you've seen, what do you think needs improvement in this home visit or nothing?Marlena Angle:	I don't know yet. I haven't started doing them for this year. I sent out my letter inviting families, so once we get back after fall break, I'll start setting up more appointmentsJose:	How do you determine what kid gets a home visit?Marlena Angle:	All the kids get a letter home and it's totally up to the families. Even though the Marcus family was nervous, they still wanted to do it because they saw the benefits. You usually have four or five families interested at first and then once the other kids start hearing that the teacher went to this person's house or this person's house, that's when other families are like, ""Maybe I'll have her over."" There's still some families that aren't comfortable with it, and that's their choice.Jose:	How do you deal with problem with kids? If you have a problem with a kid in school, how do you direct that to the home visits?Marlena Angle:	I think with the home visits, one of the things I like best is that we just go in open-minded and the point is to know the family better and to get to know what their hopes and dreams are for their kids. Then, oftentimes, the academics or behavioral issues do come up, but it's a great opportunity for us to spend more than five minutes talking about it and come up with a plan for what we could do.Jose:	(speaking [00:30:00] Spanish)Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	There's jealousy going on too. The other kids when they see that the teacher's paying attention to this kid here, they'll say, ""How come they don't come visit my parents?"" She says, ""Okay, we'll talk to your parents."" Because they didn't sign the paper, they didn't want you to visit. If they would sign that paper, then your teacher would have been visiting you too. That's a lot of questions that she has. Well, that's the question they're asking her kid actually. Other kids are asking her kid the same question.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Another thing she thinks that comes out of this too is that there's a better understanding between the parents and the teachers, and not only that, but that parent can give up his time more and go and volunteer in the schools, and get to know the teachers more and get to know the students a little bit better.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She's one of the original organizers when the principals, the teachers and everybody got together and was trying to form a plan for this.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	They did find out a lot on the first visits that they did. That the teachers found out why the student was acting the way he was acting at school because of the problems he was having at home.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	There's a lot of times too that a kid was maybe living in a hotel, living in mobile homes, and he was ashamed of where he lived. Now that that barrier has been broken, they've come in, they've seen his house, and there's nothing to it. Now they're not so ashamed of where they lived at.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	This is what came out of the evaluation of the child.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	They've made made a couple of observations too, that some kids didn't have anything to eat. Some kids, the dads work all day. They're almost not seen. They're usually at work.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Another thing that they were really worried about is culture. They wanted to show us, give you something of their family, what they eat and to respect their culture, to try to understand what they live from.Marlena Angle:	Yeah. I agree. Most of the home visits I did, it was just an eye-opener into the family and their culture and their expectations and their values and getting to know and understand [00:35:00] it better.Jose:	Did you gain respect from these parents? Do you think you are getting a little bit more respect now that you've gone to these home visits?Marlena Angle:	Definitely.Jose:	You've got to know the parents a lot more? So it's beneficial. The program has been working then.Marlena Angle:	Yeah. I'm looking forward to doing it again this next year and getting to know the current families. As the years go on, it's fun because you end up having siblings. In the case with Jordan or Dallas, it was a sibling, but we hadn't done the home visits before then. Now as you're teaching, you'll have more siblings, and so if you've done a home visit before, you already know the family and so it even makes that easier.Jose:	That's good program now. I think.Marlena Angle:	Yeah.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She's saying, even when her kids are not in the house anymore, you can come visit.Marlena Angle:	Thank you.Jose:	Because is an open house there.Marlena Angle:	Thank you.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	Her son is just ecstatic right now because you said that you're having a celebration when they come in the next year.Marlena Angle:	Like for students or?Silvia Marquez:	No.Marlena Angle:	When I'm getting married?Silvia Marquez:	Yeah.Marlena Angle:	Yes.Jose:	He's excited about that too.Marlena Angle:	It's good. I'm excited too.Jose:	Congratulations.Marlena Angle:	Thank you.Jose:	Just to wrap this up, do you think that this would be a good program for other schools to follow?Marlena Angle:	Yes, I think it is.Jose:	Or they plan it on expandedness. This coming year's over.Marlena Angle:	I'm not sure. I think that if other schools are interested in getting involved it's very important to have both, at least some features and some parents supporting the program in order for it to get started and working. If you just have teachers and no parents, it's not going to work if you have just parents and no teachers. It's definitely a team effort.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She says, it's just out of gratitude for you and the principal, that's the reason this program started and her kid can be more ecstatic about it.Silvia Marquez:	(speaking Spanish)Jose:	She figures that the relationship between a teacher and a student is really important and that brings up his academic level a lot more than what it would if he didn't have that concern.Marlena Angle:	I agree.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
mby008538,"Lucilla Contreras:	[00:00:00] My name is Lucilla Contreras. I am 44. Today is October the 30th, 2011. We're in Denver, Colorado. I'm Donovan Makha's Reggae Bloodlines producer.Donovan Makha:	I'm Donovan Makha, host and creator of a program, a cultural and musical program called Reggae Bloodlines. I've been doing it since it's creation, it's been 33 years, and glad to have Lu as producer-in-chief.Lucilla Contreras:	Thank you, Donovan. So Donovan, can you tell me a little bit about you, who you are, and how did you began Reggae Bloodlines?Donovan Makha:	Well, it has been a lot of years. The beginning was, well, coming from Jamaica at around 1977, Jamaica is a place, it's a place of music. There's a lot of musical happenings, and dance house, and concerts, and street parades, and different aspects of recorded and live music. Nyabingi gatherings, Jonkonnu, which is a part of the heritage of Kumina. Coming here to America, the first thing, I think most people from a different culture look around to familiarize themselves or see what is it that is familiar to them. For me, looking around for to hear the familiar sounds that I grew up with and was a part of me, wasn't really present, wasn't available.The thing to do was to, for instance, radio was not a source that you could tune in and hear Reggae music or hear things of Jamaica or the Caribbean. So my brothers and I who were here also in Colorado, we had a sound system, which was a part of the thing in Jamaica. Most communities have a sound system, where is, what could you call it? In familiar terms, you could call that a traveling discotheque, where you go around and you host parties or you're hired out to play at whatever engagement someone might want. But most of the time we end up creating our own engagements so to bring other people in; people with open minds, people who have traveled, and have been exposed to things Jamaica and or things international, something different than what they know in their community. It was quite successful when we would put on an event or when we were hired. Sometimes, we were hired to furnish the music for a certain function and what we would do is, they, say, expect American music, we would gradually infuse that with some Jamaican music, with Reggae music, and their response was always positive. The more positive it was, the more we would infuse it. Sometimes it just turned out to a street reggae party when it was supposed to be something else.Lucilla Contreras:	What years was that?Donovan Makha:	That was around, well, from 1977, well, through we did it for probably 10 years. But since when I came, I'm like an archivist in radio. I used to record radio programs in Jamaica just for the hang of it. There are certain radio personalities who are well in tune with [00:05:00] the common man. One of these gentleman was tragically killed some years ago, his name was Errol Thompson, goes by ET. The regular person on the street can relate to ET because he was one of the first who didn't come on the radio and speak the Queen's English that we all had to learn. We didn't have to learn, it was taught in school. So he would talk like a street Jamaican, most of the time, Patois is what we talk and the common man could relate to that. There's another gentleman who is still on the air right now in Jamaica, Winston Williams. He was also another source of inspiration. These bridges were to be looked up to and admired. The Jamaican Radio was always lively with a lot of participation, people calling in and different aspects. It wasn't just some guy sitting up there, playing music or exposing his views about things. It was always.Lucilla Contreras:	Interaction.Donovan Makha:	Yes.Lucilla Contreras:	Involvement.Donovan Makha:	Yes. When I came, even American radio wasn't really like that any how. I thought, there has to be, from our experimentation of being out there in the community with our traveling sound system, discotheque, if you will, and getting the response from people, we come to realize that people love this music and people were exposed to it in some kind of way. Not through mainstream media, but probably through their own travels or whatever. I knew there that that was like a test market, that if radio or any other open media source would present a format like a Reggae music format that it could be a productive and a fruitful venture.So it turns out that I started to venture out to see, is there a radio station around anywhere in Colorado that would entertain the idea of setting up a program? I didn't necessarily want to be, I didn't have to be the person hosting the program. But just have it, just to be able to turn on at certain time to hear a program being presented was enough for me. Doing the program itself was optional, that was almost secondary. During the course of a few years of being here, I run into different people of Jamaican descent or heritage, or have come from Jamaica like I did. A gentleman that I run into, his name was Ashley Colbert, and he was going to University of Colorado at the time. Another gentleman was from the Virgin Islands, Carden White. We run into each other at a concert that Jimmy Cliff had done at CU in Boulder.Lucilla Contreras:	The Glenn Miller Ballroom?Donovan Makha:	No, it was at a big theater there?Lucilla Contreras:	Folsom Field? The Irey theater?Donovan Makha:	The what?Lucilla Contreras:	The Irey Theater?Donovan Makha:	The Irey theater? No, it's a huge auditorium.Lucilla Contreras:	Macky.Donovan Makha:	Macky Auditorium, right?Lucilla Contreras:	Yes.Donovan Makha:	Jimmy Cliff was there. We started to talk about music, and home, and Jamaica, and everything. It turns out that these fellows had the same idea that I have been having since I came here of getting a program on radio. Them being in Boulder, and going to CU at that time, both of them, they were in tune with what was going on. I lived in Denver. Didn't get to Boulder much, didn't really have much reason to be there. So we decided, listen, I've been already looking around for a radio station. I urged them to branch out in the Boulder area and see what the possibilities are up there. So they did, and it turns out that KGNU was just coming online, was just starting up as a public radio station, a community radio. I forgot what it was back then. It was noncommercial radio. [00:10:00] The gentleman who was the station manager at the time, his name is Steve Chavis. Chavis we called him, it's probably Chevis. It's not Chavez, it's Chavis. He was very enlightened. Yeah. I think he went to see you also. He might have still been going to see you. I think he was very instrumental in entertaining the idea of doing a reggae music program. Granted the station was just starting up so they probably needed-Lucilla Contreras:	Programming.Donovan Makha:	They needed programming. But I think Steve Travis was enlightened anyhow. I think that is something he would have sought to create, something like that. It was rare to see, I don't like to use the term African American, he was a black man. He was a young black man in America doing and being the station manager for this grass root beginning radio station called KGNU. When it was presented to him, he entertained the idea. Me and the other two gentlemen that I aforementioned, we decided, we'll do this, if we had to pitch it then say, ""Hey, just give us 15 minutes or give us five minutes, just give us something and if the response is not favorable then you can toss it."" I think we really did start out with 15 minutes or half hour, it wasn't more than that.Lucilla Contreras:	Do you remember the month or the year that that was?Donovan Makha:	I think it was around 1978. I don't remember the month, it's 33 years ago. What happened yesterday or am I supposed to know? Anyway, the station was just a few months old, I believe. Anyway we did and so I decided living in Denver and those fellows living in Boulder, I said, here's the arrangement because we had the traveling sound system all ready. We had all the music because when I came to America, I didn't bring clothes and what I brought was suitcases of reggae music and things like that. I said, listen guys, we'll do this program and I will supply the music and I will come and will do, I don't have to be the host. You go ahead and do the hosting and I will supply the material and whatever the program needs and just be behind the scenes. We started out like that. Then periodically I would get in and do and say things and the people would respond favorable to, probably the way I would approach and deliver what we were trying to do. Eventually before long I was doing the program and so it was three of us in the mix rotating. Then within the first two years, those guys graduated and left. I continued to host the program solo since that time within the first two years and it has evolved into some other things. Well, that's a long answer to one question, what was that question by the way?Lucilla Contreras:	How did you begin Reggae Bloodlines?Donovan Makha:	Oh is that, was that the question?Lucilla Contreras:	Yes.Donovan Makha:	Okay, all right.Lucilla Contreras:	Then Reggae Bloodlines was began by you and two other gentlemen. But the other two went on with their lives and you've been the mainstay and continuing for at least 33 years?Donovan Makha:	I have been. Was there from its inception, I created it, I gave it the name Reggae Bloodlines.Lucilla Contreras:	Where did the name of Reggae Bloodlines come from?Donovan Makha:	Well, a friend of mine was involved in a project of putting a book, it was almost like a literary documentary of permanent reggae artists and musicians, people who have shaped the music currently for that time and pastimes, some of whom were all ready deceased. It was almost like an encyclopedia of who is who in the music and the backgrounds. Then they were [00:15:00] contemplating the idea of calling the book Reggae Bloodlines. I thought the program that I envision that would be the perfect name for a radio program that would deal with the music, the musicians, the movers and the makers and shapers, the history of the music, how it evolves, the culture it comes out of, and the projection of it. Not just to be on radio spinning tunes and people being silly, but really to educate and enlightened people about a music that was more than a music.Reggae music was the daily news, it was the weekly news. If you wanted to know what was going on in Jamaica, get a current record of any artist and you could have a good idea of what's happening in Jamaica itself with the people and how is the culture shifting and what are the trends and all of that. I gave it that name and the name was right for that time and even now and that's how the name came about.Lucilla Contreras:	That's beautiful. Can you tell me who's been the biggest influence on you for Reggae Bloodlines and what lessons have you learned from those people or that person?Donovan Makha:	Well, the influences that I have had, it's not really a person, but it's really Jamaican radio itself, the way Jamaican radio was presented and even now still. For instance, there's a guy in Jamaica he died some years ago. Back in the day radio was, you would have an announcer and then you would have an operator behind the glass who would actually play the music, the commercial, the announcer would just be talking with a mike. Operators became more famous, more known or more renowned than the announcers themselves like this guy Michael Campbell, known as Mikey Dread. He was an operator for Errol Thompson and most of the DJs at the radio jock set JBC, Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation at the time. There were others like him Mikey White, Errol Chin, Mikey Chambers, Norman Marsh. These are operators I'm telling you about. Normally, the guy behind the glass is the guy in the background that nobody should hear or know anything about. But these guys the way they Jamaican radio was so involved, their names were out there when they were producing, or behind the glass you would hear their names on little jingles and things they do were like trademark little sounds that they would make.Michael Campbell, he started to host a program from midnight to 4:00 AM in the morning. He didn't speak, he just played music but it was the little things he did in the side of the little jingles and the noise and the sounds that he would bring out and create people just loved it. Then he had exclusive connections with studios that cut records, so most of his music would be music that's pre-released that wasn't available to the general public. People would listen to him to hear what was new and fresh and just to hear him. On the street corners and night, people would stay up from midnight till 4:00 in the morning. All radios would be tuned to the JBC and it would be one big party on the street and he would be supplying the music. It was a beautiful thing. All of that, it's Jamaican radio that really influenced me and these guys who were like the guys I mentioned and the ones I mentioned before. They are very instrumental the way I do radio and I've done radio in America is the way that I love to hear radio in Jamaica. I probably even do it because I've maintained that whereas things have shifted in Jamaica some degree, I have tried to maintain that, that I grew up with. That's my influence, it wasn't really much of [00:20:00] a but Errol Thompson, ET, he was very influential in my thought pattern and process. I still even say things that he would say.Lucilla Contreras:	Like what, for example?Donovan Makha:	This is what he would say, he would say, ""Thank you for listening. You didn't have to do it, but you did.""Lucilla Contreras:	Yes. I heard you say that over the years so much.Donovan Makha:	That is something that moved me, because it's like he's taken it in a personal way. When I do radio, I'd mean so is like somebody could be doing all kinds of things other than listening to me on the radio, is not just one radio there so many choices. Especially now for somebody to tune in is like they didn't have to do it, but they did. Even back then, that moved me. I still say little things that keep those guys memory and vibe alive.Lucilla Contreras:	Can you tell me what's your favorite memory that you have of being on Reggae Bloodlines?Donovan Makha:	Some of my best memories is when my children were little people and not just my children, but any. Over the years what happened is if I see a child in the studio anywhere, just walking around, I would get that child and bring them into the studio and have them on the radio. Just whatever they feel like saying or not saying. Sometimes they'd clam up and some time they were just very expressive. Those are always my favorite times, is when not just my children but any child, I don't have to know who they are, comes in at the radio station and he's willing to participate.Lucilla Contreras:	What about your favorite memory of somebody, either you've had on the show, either an artist, or a group, or a musician?Donovan Makha:	Well, I don't know, you know what? One of the favorite time is, I have a sister, her name is Joyce, and this is not a half-sister or an adopted sister, she's my mother and father's child. But she grew up apart from us in Panama. There was some deal where my mother thought that some cousins were going to keep her and return her, but it turned out it was some adoption and my mother, she wasn't privy to the things that happened, it was some underhanded things, and we sought her for many years and found her around in her twenties. She was a grown woman when we found her, she didn't even realize, or had no clue she had eight other brothers and sisters. She thought she was an only child living with these people who were her parents. So we found her and eventually she didn't speak English and all of that. She came to Colorado to visit some years ago, and she was at the radio station with me at one time when she came. We just were walking around Boulder in University of Colorado and she was on the radio, and it was a nice experience, I rather liked that. It wasn't any musician, or singers, or artists, no. I know there are some nice ones out there, but I'm family there.Lucilla Contreras:	So what artists and musicians have you had on Reggae Bloodlines? Some of them, who are some?Donovan Makha:	I don't know, we've had  Mutabaruka, Joseph Hill, who died a few years ago, Sugar Minott, died a few. These are the some of the legendary guys am mentioning, a lot of them have passed, well, some of them, good amount of them. There is a group called Foundation, there's a gentleman with my name named Donovan, he came out big time, but I haven't heard much of [00:25:00] him lately. But he was one of the guys that I thought would be wailing and doing. I don't know, you know what?I don't know what happened in people's lives, there were so many, and there were a lot of recorded interviews like Peter Tosh, when he would come to Colorado, we'd be able to sit down and talk, and I had a reasoning with him that we recorded that I've lost it, so I came even present it anymore. But Peter Tosh was one of the guys who I really relish having on the program because to me, he was the most solid person and always a revolutionary. He was like, what we see going on right now, and occupied Denver going on. That was Peter Tosh right there, he was occupying the world. That was his stance.Lucilla Contreras:	He gave you encouragement and things. When you interviewed him, what did he have to say to you about what you're doing?Donovan Makha:	Well, the thing about him is like Beres Hammond, who is one of the gigantic reggae acts and artists out there, and Maxi Priest, those guys, we've had them on the program. These guys, the bigger they are, sometimes it's the more humble they are, and there's the nicest like Beres Hammond, there are two guys on the planet right now that are alive and well, Beres Hammond and Pato Banton, those guys, they're just humble. They're just the humblest human being, and if they weren't doing music, they would just be humble human beings. They just happen to be humble and big in the music. So it's always a pleasure having those guys on the radio. But there are a lot of people that we've had on through the years. Anyone who is anyone.Lucilla Contreras:	Judy Mowatt.Donovan Makha:	Judy Mowatt, yeah, we actually brought her to do a show in Boulder and so we had her on, and probably any name you mention is somebody I would have had on the program.Lucilla Contreras:	Do you have any experiences with Bob Marley, either at the radio or any other?Donovan Makha:	Bob Marley, we have experiences. Bob Marley came to Denver once, December 5, 1979, and at DU, Denver University, at the DU arena, and he came and we were there with him because I knew Bob Marley from Jamaica. I live a block away from the national stadium where the national team would train the football team, and my brother was a member of the national team, my brother Lorne. So Bob Marley would come over to the practice every evening because his best friend who played for Jamaica at the time, a gentleman by the name of Allan Cole, they called him Allan Skill Cole. They just called him Skill, this guy was so skilled. He goes by one name, Skill. So that was Bob Marley's compadre, so Bob Marley would come over there now, and Alan Skill Cole was a big-time rasta man, dreadlocks. If you're not a Rasta man, the moniker for you is you're a bald head. A bald head doesn't mean your head is shaved, it just means you're not a dreadlocks.Lucilla Contreras:	No dreads.Donovan Makha:	My brother would be in the practice, I remember I was over there one time and my brother would tackle Alan Skill Cole, because nobody wanted to tackle Allan Skill Cole because he was such a baller. He would just do magical things that make you look stupid. So people were afraid to even tackle him for the ball. So he would just walk by with the ball and people would just look at him with such respect and dread. But my brother, he didn't back down from Skill Cole, he would tackle him, and tackle him hard because then you have to tackle him hard because you can't have him embarrass you. So when you go in, you have to go for it. So Bob Marley would be off on the side now yelling, not in a bad way, just saying things like, I remember one time he said to my brother, ""Hey, bald head, mind how you tackle the dread, because if you hurt the dread, things could get red,"" and other things like that.So he had always said [00:30:00] in jest and in fun, and also when Bob Marley came to Colorado that one time that he did, we talked to him, we were there with him in the backstage and the changing rooms. He wasn't a very talkative person, especially when he was on tour and playing. But I remember one of the guys at the time, Carden, was with me and I said, ""Carden, go ahead and interview Bob. I arranged it."" I said, ""Do an interview with Bob Marley."" Because it's hard for me to interview people that I know. It's hard. So I said, ""You interview Bob Marley."" So we gave him the equipment. I don't remember what the question that he asked Bob Marley, and Bob Marley said, this is exactly what he said, and I think Carden still has the tape. Bob Marley says, ""Seek and you shall find man."" That's what he said, ""Seek and you shall find man."" Carden looked at me, he was stunned. He didn't continue from there on. He didn't know what else to say to Bob because the question he was asking Bob was something so profound and so little came out of Bob Marley that itself was very profound. I don't think Carden knew how to compute and he didn't understand. He thought, okay, the man didn't want to talk to him or something. But he didn't understand that's just how Bob Marley was, that's how he talks, that's how he reason, he doesn't elaborate on things most of the time. So that was my Colorado interaction with Bob.Lucilla Contreras:	Wasn't there something with the body guards?Donovan Makha:	Oh at that show? Oh yeah, that concert. I happen to have a recording of that concert, probably the only one that exists on the planet right now. It was made because it's a tradition when people do stage shows in Jamaica, or even a sound system show where you have a big dancehall party. Sound systems in Jamaica are like bands in America, in fact, they're bigger than bands. So like a sound system, there is a sound system called Stone Love. That is, more people in Jamaica would go see Stone Love DJs do their thing than to go hear Bob Marley play. This is how big sound systems are. People would rather go see a guy spin tunes than to go hear the biggest artist do his thing. I went into the concert at DU with, back in the day we had ghetto blasters or recorders, mobile ghetto blasters.Lucilla Contreras:	Boombox.Donovan Makha:	Boombox. They all had recording out microphones. So I was standing there in the audience with my boombox, and it was a big one too on my shoulder, above the crowd just recording the concert. These, what do you call them, bouncers?Lucilla Contreras:	Yeah, bouncers.Donovan Makha:	For the show, they tackled me because of this and they tried to eject my brothers and I from the concert. It was a big fight because we weren't leaving, we came to see Bob. It was a huge struggle and we were determined not to be put out. These guys were huge, these guys were some giants probably on steroids or something. Anyway, while this commotion was going on, Bob Marley's cook, most of those guys would travel with a nutritionist, they didn't call him that. Bob Marley's cook, a gentleman named Gilly. I knew Gilly from back in Jamaica. So Gilly saw what was going on. So he comes over and he looks at these bouncers and he looks up straight and say, ""Hey, what is this? Why are you people harassing Bob Marley's security? Don't you know these people are Bob Marley's security?"" Referring to myself and my brothers and they backed off real quick. They were like, ""We didn't know. We thought some guy was in here pirating or doing something."" He was like, ""No, Bob Marley's security."" So that's when we went into the back with Gilly and start hanging with Bob Marley and the rest of the crew. But that was a funny thing.Lucilla Contreras:	That's awesome Dono. Well, what are your hopes and dreams for the future of Reggae Bloodlines and yourself?Donovan Makha:	[00:35:00] Well, you know the program over, since the past dozen years or so, or maybe even more than that, it could be the last 15 or more years out of 33 years that I've been doing it, and I keep hearing that it's the longest running. What do they say it is? Longest running something.Lucilla Contreras:	It's the longest running reggae show in the United States, Reggae Bloodlines.Donovan Makha:	Would that make me the longest running reggae DJ?Lucilla Contreras:	Reggae DJ in the United States. Yes, it would.Donovan Makha:	Oh dear God, I'm getting old. I need a retirement plan. Anyway, my aspirations for the show is that, other people have been doing it now so I don't do it every week like I used to back in the day. For the last however many years, there has been a rotation, there's probably four or five different people that does the program now. We do it on the first and the last weekend of the month now. I live 100 miles away from Boulder and have been for the last 25 years. But I hope that the other people who do the program, who understands the philosophy behind it, to include the people, the audience, not be one of those ego tripping radio personality that think that they are bigger than the listeners. Especially listeners that are contributors, that are the members that keep KGNU alive. Because we're a non-commercial radio station, so it's our pledge drives and listenership that supports us. So you have to make the people feel like they own the thing because they do. This has always been the way I approach it. I hope that the other presenters when they're there would take the people's phone calls and if they want to get on the air, put them on the air, and if they want to come into the studio and see what's up, let them come in. Be open about it, don't just act like some kind of a tyranny going on. It shouldn't be that way.Lucilla Contreras:	Beautiful, and hopefully we'll continue hearing you on Reggae Bloodlines for another 33 years or more. Now, what do you think about the new ways that we have to connect with Reggae Bloodlines through social media, Internet and those different things?Donovan Makha:	Well, you know me, it's very slow for me to get up to speed with new media because I still drag 12 inch and 45s and LP's. Even of couple months ago, I was playing cassettes, sometimes reel-to-reel. Whatever medium I have the music on, I will drag it. Fortunately, KGNU is insightful enough to keep some of those old implements around to play this music. We still have a reel-to-reel machine in the studio, and the cassette, and a DAC player and MiniDisc. So we have all of those mediums and all of those players and recorders in the studio. So whatever medium your music is on, you ought to be able to play it other than just CDs and MP3s.Lucilla Contreras:	Do you like the interaction that you can use it online also while you're doing the radio program?Donovan Makha:	The online thing, it brings another level of participation to the program. You know what I do is very lively and really and truly I should have a video camera in the studio because it's almost like it's wasted the way it's done. It's very animated. What goes on and the way it happens because, I don't have a planned program. I don't arrange it, I don't plan it, I don't seek, I don't select music prior to it being played. I know what I'm playing the minute that I play it and I don't know what I'm playing after that until while something is being played, I'm digging, I'm running outside looking in the trunk of the car to see did I bring that or back in the library to see if I can find that. So it's very animated. But the new media, what do you call it? Social media? It's cool, the interaction is nice. The Facebook thing and I don't do Twitter or nothing like that but maybe I should one of these days.Lucilla Contreras:	You have listeners all over the world?Donovan Makha:	Yes, we have some listeners who are [00:40:00] steadfast in listening from everywhere, Sweden, and Germany, and Australia, Africa, Jamaica, everywhere. So the new media is instant and people know we're there so they can tune in. The program is archived for a few weeks so they can download it later on or just listen to it at a later time. It's expensive in that way. I'm still learning, I'm still open to learn about new things and maintaining the old tradition and presenting it through these new mediums is what I hope to do.Lucilla Contreras:	So beautiful.FEMALE_1:	Can I ask just a question? This may be a hard one, but what songs over the years have moved you?Donovan Makha:	Songs?FEMALE_1:	Songs, yeah.Donovan Makha:	Songs. I'll tell you some songs that have moved me. It's so weird because there's some songs that. There's, Peter Tosh has a song called, Fools Die For Want of Wisdom. It's like a biblical thing, but the way the arrangement, the musical arrangement, it's like an organ. It's not something you dance to. It's very solemn selection of music. There's a lot of music that sometimes I play and tears come to my eye. There are some tunes that it's hard for me to play [inaudible 00:41:41] on the radio because, it really touch me in some ways that people would not understand.Lucilla Contreras:	What is your favorite reggae song, or music, or dub, if you care to to pick?Donovan Makha:	Really? Now, well, there's some guys, some acts that you love, like Aswad is a group based in England, and anything they do is always something that. Some people like Bob Marley. Some people say, ""What's your favorite Bob Marley tune?"" Well, you can't pick a favorite Bob Marley tune because they're all favorites. Aswad is like that. Peter Tosh is like that. So the people that you love, there's some people you love because of the way they deliver, what they deliver.  There's some people you love because of their voice. So they can say something very stupid, but the way their voice says it, you just have to love it because of their voice. So sometimes it's a lyric, it's the voice, it's the tone, it's the delivery, maybe it's the arrangement of the music. I have a lot of favorites. I've too many favorites.Lucilla Contreras:	You mentioned it earlier that in Jamaica reggae is a way to communicate what was happening. So this is another maybe a big question, but why is reggae important to you?Donovan Makha:	That's a good question. Why is it important to me? Well, it becomes a natural inborn thing. You grow up in this society where there is music around you. I mean, the thing about Jamaica is, Jamaica has a lot of first for a place that's considered an island. Jamaica was one of the first places that had radio, and back there it wasn't broadcast radio. It was a thing called Radio Fusion, this is like in the '50s or '40s, I don't know how. But way down the line, like there was a radio station in Jamaica, used to be called RJR, and that stands for Radio Jamaica and Radio Fusion. Now Radio Fusion was like radio by cable. So the cable that people knows now, like cable TV and things like that, this was what Radio Fusion was back in the day before broadcast radio. It was like the oldest form of delivering radio, was not over the ear, it was through the wire.Lucilla Contreras:	Wow.Donovan Makha:	So you grow up in the culture of radio. The proximity of where Jamaica is and an English speaking country, a lot of American music and different things flow through there. So it's not just reggae music that Jamaicans know. One thing I love about Jamaicans is that, we know music, we know music from everywhere. It doesn't have to be a language we speak. We know music as we are lovers of music. The reason I love reggae music is, it's been with me, [00:45:00] and as a young person growing up, you go to these dance halls and it was the past-time. Like kids would be playing video games nowadays. Back then you play records or you play music. We didn't have instruments available to us. There was not music in school and stuff like that, because of cost. So the radio became your instrument most of the time, and then records, I mean, Jamaica is probably, I think it's in the Guinness Book of World Records, Jamaica produce the most recordings per day than per capita than anywhere else. So records are put out daily. In that way, it becomes like a newspaper, like a blog.Lucilla Contreras:	So it's like reggae is part of you, is part of who you are. It's not just, say, is a record. It's like a way of life, it's who you are.Donovan Makha:	It's totally, totally and gets in the DNA of who I am, and most Jamaicans that I know, it's that way. It's not just reggae music, it's just music. Jamaicans are music lovers in some ways that it's almost freakish. Yes, that's true.Lucilla Contreras:	Well, Donovan, I just really wanted to thank you, and I wanted to tell you how honored that I am to be with you on Reggae Bloodlines, and that you have made me your producer for Reggae Bloodlines, and how much it means to me. Because reggae music is, as a Native American woman, is such an ingrained part of me and who I am as well, speaks to me because of the struggles of Jamaican people are just like the struggles that Native Americans have gone through here. So I'm just so honored that I'm able to be with you on your 33 year program of Reggae Bloodlines. I don't take it for granted, and I don't take it lightly. I appreciate all the lessons that you've taught me on the radio as far as the board, and the system, and the flow of music, and especially what I really love is, what you say, your interaction with the listeners and keeping that live, because I think that's such a crucial part that makes your Reggae Bloodlines different from all the other DJs that now host Reggae Bloodlines, because of that interaction that you bring to the people and you bring it live and real, and you don't make yourself above the listeners, you're part of the listeners, and I really appreciate and love that.Donovan Makha:	Well, I love that you're in the mix and you've been a huge enhancement to what I do, and to the program itself. The listeners have responded very well to you being there so don't see doing it without you anytime soon. So I hope you keep coming. I'll keep coming.Lucilla Contreras:	Me too.Donovan Makha:	Thanks.Lucilla Contreras:	Thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
mby008556,"Gregorio Al'Carrol:	[00:00:00] Yes. My name is Gregorio Al'Carrol. I'm 48 years old. Today's date is November the fourth, 2011, and we are at the Denver Public Library in Denver, Colorado. I am the son of Martha Al'Carrol who I'm going to interview.Martha Al'Carrol:	My name is Martha Al'Carrol. I'm 88 years old and I'm beginning to feel it. It is November fourth, 2011 in Denver, Colorado and I'm here with my son Gregorio. I'm his mom. My husband is deceased. I have one more other son in Abu Dhabi in the Middle East, his name is Nicholas Al'Carrol.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Right, I brought some photo albums that dad made. He was born in 1910. He died five years ago. I have some of the albums that he put together when he was dating you. But I wanted to talk about your experiences in Auraria growing up as a kid during the 1920s and 1930s. I wanted to talk about where you lived and what you remember about Cherry Creek, which  I understand was one of the borders of Auraria. What do you remember, first of all, is your relationships with your family.Martha Al'Carrol:	I was a middle child. There were mom and dad, and they had seven kids and I was the fifth child. Most of my siblings now have passed away. I have one more sister left, Berlin. I was born in 1924 in Bronzeville, Colorado, which was a little town just outside of Denver was a farming community. My father and my mother moved to Denver from Texas. My father was a printer and he moved to Denver where he got a job with a printing company. He didn't speak much English but he learned very quickly that he had to. As I said, I am the middle child of seven children.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Over the years, you've told me about the depression and the difficult times. You mentioned that in 1933, there was a big flood and at that point your family was renting a home in Auraria. Could you tell about the flooding in Cherry Creek?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. Well, prior to the Cherry Creek Dam that was built, I don't remember when. But certainly between then and now, we can just accept that the fact that we would be having a flood because that was just the nature of the total area. We were pretty well aversed with that. We were pretty well-prepared except in the last flood, which came suddenly and we had spent days preparing sliced apples for drying, which we did dry and it just wiped out all our food supply. We didn't have a lot of our food.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So this was in the basement and everything was flooded.Martha Al'Carrol:	Everything was flooded and it was just mobile mud, just running through. That was before, as I said before the dam was built. It was just something that we had to prepare for on a yearly basis until the dam was built.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You mentioned yet there was snakes and all sorts running out there after that part.Martha Al'Carrol:	There were toads and snakes and all kinds of snakes running out there.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Your mom didn't speak English too well. Your dad didn't speaking English and now you were left without a housing. What happened next after the flood?Martha Al'Carrol:	Well, we started looking for another house and that's where we ended up after renting a couple of places. We ended up at 1029th Street in Denver, and the family lived there ever since. It's a huge house.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Your mom bought the house? In 1933 I understand there was a housing shortage and [00:05:00] there was no quality housing and for a lady to purchase a home at that time, that seemed pretty remarkable.Martha Al'Carrol:	It was remarkable, yes. I don't know, but she was able to work her way through there and say, I need a house for my family. I have a big family. Mr. Cole was a man who owned the house. I remember him distinctly, very distinguished, tall, thin, man and he checked out the family and thought that would be a good idea. He sold the house to my mother and the two store-y with a basement, and we had a whole u-shape building in the brick building in the back that they used for stables and horses and whatever else he had. That was how we finally got a permanent home. We were there since 1933, I think till the present. I mean, well, we don't live there anymore. That's been taken over by historic Denver. It's now the historic 9th Street Park, and I'm glad that one of our homes is part of that historic park.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Getting back to Cherry Creek, what were some other activities? You mentioned sometimes during the summertime they had farmers put out food out there.Martha Al'Carrol:	Along Cherry Creek from Market Street to Colfax Avenue, there were stalls. Every summer, there were permanent stalls where the farmers would come in and bring their produce and they sold it from there. The produce that they couldn't sell or they didn't sell, they would just leave there for the neighborhood. Everybody had plenty of food at a very critical time at my day.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Well, that sounds interesting. Well, first of all you're the middle child. You had to watch your older daughter, Berlin, when she was dating. Is that a chaperone?Martha Al'Carrol:	That was a family tradition, the girls didn't go out on dates without chaperones if my dad allowed it. That's how it was.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Even though you were younger you were still-Martha Al'Carrol:	I had a plus there because I'd have to go along, and fellas didn't like it.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So you'd walk around the Creek.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. They give me $0.05 to go to buy ice creams which I couldn't turn down. That gave a little bit of privacy, but we never told mom and dad.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You also have memories of, you used to run errands. You said as a middle child used to run family errands.Martha Al'Carrol:	I loved to do that because I could do whatever I wanted. I used to go for the groceries, I used to do shopping, I used to take shoes to be repaired because in those days you didn't buy new shoes every time when your old ones were worn out, you'd just had them repaired. They were comfortable because you had used them for so long.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You'd cross the Creek a lot.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You'd cross Lamar bridge and on the way to Lamar, what were some of the people you saw and this is the old part of Denver at that time?Martha Al'Carrol:	The old part of Denver and the Creek before they built, I want to remember the containment was there, but I used to do all the shopping. I used to do a lot of the shopping and I enjoyed that because I spent a lot of time. I take off to little different areas now and then. I wanted to explore on my own.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	The bridge was in Lamar Street that crossed the bridge and you mentioned an old hotel, that you used to cross-by. .Martha Al'Carrol:	There was an old hotel on 12 in Lamar that housed a bunch of very old men, which I found out later were Civil War veterans. A lot of them had wooden legs, amputations, and things. We weren't allowed to talk to, my folks wouldn't let us to talk to strangers, but they used to come around give us pennies and things once in a while.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You mentioned one man who gave you pennies and his name was Steve, is that it?Martha Al'Carrol:	Steve I remember him. He had a wooden leg.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Where did he get the pennies from?Martha Al'Carrol:	I don't know.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Someone did at one time told me that he used to keep his money in his where he hid the money.Martha Al'Carrol:	He had a little opening in his leg and [00:10:00] I think Ray discovered that's where he kept his money. I don't know. I guess he sculpted it out or did something, I don't know.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So you were able to see at your age a witness of a Civil War veteran?Martha Al'Carrol:	I didn't know they were Civil War veterans and also I used to run into a woman that I thought was very unusual. She had black, always wore black and her head was covered. Her very blue eyes, which I hadn't managed to look at. That was Baby Doe Taper, the wife of Taper because of big builder and the big money man here.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	She was wearing worn-out clothes as you had mentioned, and used to run into her. See here at a distance.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yes. By that time she had lived such an elegant life and such a fantastic life and questionable life, but I saw her as an old lady. She was not too social at all. She was evidently had gone through some very traumatic experiences.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Well, there was another story about Cherry Creek as you told over the years that you're walking along with your dad, you saw men with big pans, you asked your dad, ""What were men with those big pans doing?""Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. There were men in the creek and they had these big round pans. I didn't know what they were and they were swishing them around. For a while, I thought they were just playing, that I said, ""Old men playing."" They were very serious. They were mining for gold.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	During the Depression?Martha Al'Carrol:	They'd come up with little nuggets now and then.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So you witnessed some of the old pioneers of the Denver Cherry Creek miners.Martha Al'Carrol:	I did. I didn't appreciate it at the time but it was, yeah. I'm assuming there was no house in Hadley, and these were very old men. You could tell that they were very well-versed in gold panning because they were very professional, the way they did it. I don't know how much money they got out of the creek then but it must have been lucrative to some point.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then you mentioned that the Cherry Creek has good memories of you with your father, you had.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, he was with Kestler Printing. I don't know how he developed because he had to set the type and he didn't speak much English, but I think he learned fast. I used to bring his lunch every day and I'd sit at Cherry Creek, the level part there of Cherry Creek, while he ate his lunch and then I'd go back home.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So a lot of your memories with him are in Cherry Creek?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, they were priceless. I didn't know that at the time, but they were because he told me stories and some I can't remember, which I'm really upset about. But yeah, he told me stories about himself, and how he met my mom, how they came to Denver.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	That was during the Mexican Revolution?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. My dad was from Mexico, my mother was from Texas. He was really torn apart because he had friends on both sides of the conflict, and it was just eating away at them because they didn't know what to do. They decided to come to Denver. I don't know if that's the main reason but that's where they ended up and that's where all this family was born, all seven of us. It was Ralph who was born in Juarez, and then I was born in New Mexico, and the rest were born in Denver.FEMALE_1:	What are your parents names?Martha Al'Carrol:	Ramon and Caroline Gonzales. Later on when my dad developed a heart condition, it was in 1940s I think. Anyway, when we moved to 1029 Street, which was our last home, our restaurant became quite famous for the people here in Denver. The Casa Mayan restaurant. Then a lot of the [00:15:00] troops that used to come like the Spanish troops the [inaudible 00:15:04] , and a lot of the Latin-American artists would stop there to have dinner. My mother was a fantastic cook. It was part of her French heritage she said, but she was very good. She was just fantastic. I wish I could have taken up her talent.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Getting back to the Depression again, after the flood, you mentioned that you've had a lot of people coming at the door asking for food or help and you wanted to share some of the memories you have of this.Martha Al'Carrol:	During the Depression?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Martha Al'Carrol:	That was terrible. Well, to me, they were old men but looking back, they were late teenagers maybe. There was no work. It was very, very traumatic for a lot of people.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	These were non-Hispanics?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. They learned how to eat Hispanic food real quick. Mum was, like I said, she was a terrific cook.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	How often did they come asking for food or help?Martha Al'Carrol:	During the Depression, this could be a daily experience.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	They rode the rails?Martha Al'Carrol:	They rode the rails from one end of the country to the other, I'm assuming.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Because Casa Mayan was the house and 1020 was not too far from the railroad tracks?Martha Al'Carrol:	No. It wasn't a restaurant there, it was just our home.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Do you remember that?Martha Al'Carrol:	We did have a lot of people from young men, who I'd viewed as older men when I was little, from the Depression. The Depression was pretty traumatic. One thing that I do remember about the Depression is that people shared, they helped each other out. I'm not sure that would be true today, I don't know.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	We're also going to talk about, you helped during the war with your father at Lowry Air Force and you worked there.Martha Al'Carrol:	I worked first at the Fitzsimons Hospital, it's a medical army hospital. I worked in occupational therapy there for a while.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	What did that involve?Martha Al'Carrol:	Well, a lot of the soldiers came back injured, or they couldn't use their arms and our job was to teach them how to use their limbs again, and help them, and give them some moral support. But it was an army hospital. Then from there, I went on to Lowry Field, which was an army base where I did the secretarial work.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	There you met a lot of friends, lifelong friends?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. Paul Willet who ran the Gaslight Theater here in Denver for years, he was from New York. He started the Gaslight Theater in the service with the service men.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Do you have any memories of the plays that he put on there?Martha Al'Carrol:	I remember he got into trouble because they decided they want to do a spoof on the women so they all played these parts of women with GI boots.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	The men played the parts of the women?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, and it was just a crazy play. I think the commander finally shut it down.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So that's your experiences during the war and then after the war, you told me you went to help your sister with her baby, and then you moved to New York in 1946.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Tell me what were you doing in New York? You'd said you were working?Martha Al'Carrol:	I don't know. I asked myself that question when I got there, but it was interesting. It was a foreign culture to me because I didn't know anybody and nobody cared if they ran over you or not, but it was interesting. Some of my best friends are still in New York, but it was an eye-opener.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You went to Columbia College?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, or Columbia University for a while.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Tell me about those experiences?Martha Al'Carrol:	Where? At the college?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	At the college, you were Mexican.Martha Al'Carrol:	Mexican-American.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	But you wanted to learn language? Export and import.Martha Al'Carrol:	I wanted to take some [00:20:00] commercial Spanish because I wanted to get into the export business which I eventually did and it was very helpful. Wonderful people. I have wonderful memories of New York.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Now, there weren't too many Mexicans, I assume it, were there? In New York?Martha Al'Carrol:	No. Well, they didn't know how to introduce me. They didn't know a lot of people there, and of course not like today but they didn't know what Mexican-Americans were. They figured some odd people.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You joined the club that you told me, a Spanish Club?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	What was it called? In New York, you joined?Martha Al'Carrol:	Well, my professor at Columbia told me to go there because I told him I wanted to practice. It was a different kind of Spanish. Our Spanish here is very regional. Spanish in New York is very different because you have your Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican people in Dominican Republic. But they spoke differently, and they spoke fast, and they would cut their words in half, and I wasn't used to. I had to learn how to speak Spanish their way. But it was interesting because it opened a whole new world to me.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You joined a cultural club called?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	What was the name of that club?Martha Al'Carrol:	El Centro.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	El Centro? That's where you met Dad?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He was Italian.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. He was there to learn Spanish too but never took. I talked to him in Spanish and he answered me in Italian, but it worked out. It worked out okay.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You used to go out with your friends and have discussions in New York after college.Martha Al'Carrol:	We had great times after class.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	What did you do?Martha Al'Carrol:	We had all-night cafeterias.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	That was new to you?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, and we'd spend a lot of time talking and philosophizing. We knew everything at that age. We had the answers to everything. We were going to set the world straight.FEMALE_1:	Well, what did you philosophize about?Martha Al'Carrol:	Well, culture. Because New York was so different then, I met people from all over. It was a conglomeration, we all had input into what topic we decided to talk about, and we found out that we had all different opinions about different things. So it was challenging, but it was fun.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You had a part-time job. What was some of the other cultural shocks that you had? Did people find you strange or your behavior being brought up in a Mexican-American in Denver?Martha Al'Carrol:	I thought New Yorkers were terribly rude. But putting myself in their place, I found out why everybody rushed around, nobody smiled, it looked to me like nobody smiled. But once I got to know the real New Yorkers, then I really liked it.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	But you were told once by your boss and he was concerned. What did he tell you?Martha Al'Carrol:	He says, ""You're too nice. If you want to belong here, you'd stop being so nice."" But I didn't know what that meant exactly.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	So you went out with dad, that would be in 1947. You knew his background, he was born in 1910, so he's a little older than you. Did he ever tell you about his boxing?Martha Al'Carrol:	No, I found out about it later. He was my great protector. I could go any place with him.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He grew up in a pretty rough place.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, he grew up in the Bronx.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I remember him telling me that he grew up the same neighborhood as Jake LaMotta who was known as the raging bull.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. Well, you saw the picture of all the boxing champions?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Yeah, I have that right here.Martha Al'Carrol:	Okay. Talk about cultural shock, we were so opposite, our experiences were so different.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He was with a lot of these ex fighters, ex champions that he used to hang around with. He boxed as a middle weight.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He used to tell me that he didn't have the proper management back then. You'd fight different weight divisions and the training schedule and the fight schedule is so erratic. But he always mentioned his friend or his idol at the time was the light heavyweight champion of the world, Paul Berlenbach.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, I met Paul.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He used to see him down the street.Martha Al'Carrol:	I met Paul Berlenbach. He had huge [00:25:00] hands and he was such a gentle man. He had a little dog and no one could touch that little dog. It was not my vision of a fight or it didn't look like, but he was ferocious in the ring according to him.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Yeah, he was a heavy weight champion in wrestling.Martha Al'Carrol:	In wrestling, too?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Also in the Olympics, yeah. What was interesting is that was his like idol, and then years later he'd team up with him and start a gym.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, they started the Leather Pushers Gym in lower Manhattan. They had a big gym. They were so different from what I had grown up with.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He told me he was like Damon Runyon. He used to mention that Damon Runyon a lot, that that was like a Damon Runyon experience.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, it was. Well, Damon Runyon was from Denver. It was a shock kind of but after a while I begun to act like a New Yorker myself because I had to survive.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Yeah, that was what he was known for, was protecting people. He did in the ballroom dancing, he used to tell a lot about exhibition ballroom.Martha Al'Carrol:	He was a great ballroom dancer. Yeah, he danced professionally.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then he used to brag a lot about there's only two people that can dance the tango, it was him and Valentino. Now, in his war experiences, I know he didn't talk too much.Martha Al'Carrol:	No.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Toward the end, I was able to spend time with him and I put together this photo album and was able to open up some of the experiences. I think because he was older, he was in his mid 30s when he signed up for the war. He was able to handle a lot of things. He told me he was in the Navy chasing the German submarines in the Atlantic, and then he was assigned to the Pacific with the Japanese, fighting the Japanese.Martha Al'Carrol:	He traveled all over the world.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He mentioned there was a gunners mate. Some of the places they went to was Okinawa and Leyte in the Philippines. He didn't talk too much. He did mention, I think strangely enough, being brought up in New York in that neighborhood, not traveling a lot, there seemed to be some sparkle in his eyes when he talked about traveling around the world. I mean, strangely enough, I think he had some pleasurable experiences with that despite the horrific times. Just for him, it was an adventure.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, he did. Well, he saw a lot of his friends killed.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	One thing he mentioned, he always brought up occasionally, whenever I'd ask him was a time that he remembered before a battle, this young man had black hair, that next day his hair turned all white, and he never forgot that experiences.Martha Al'Carrol:	That's horrific. The war is horrific.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	But what I always admired about him, he always spoke the truth. He was blunt, but he was always truthful. But I remember the story he told me right after the war, that he was with his little daughter in a playground, and there was a Japanese man with his little daughter. The Japanese girl wanted to use the swing and a bunch of bullies, American bullies, prevented them from using the swing, and he chased them out. He became lifelong friends with this Japanese man. I have always admired that part of it, always sticking up. He taught me justice years later because he was 53 when I was born, and we had a whole different world experiences, but it was afterwards, after he died, I recognize that some of that fighting behavior and that standing up for the underdog is having an impact on me late in life, in social issues that we're fighting and so forth.Martha Al'Carrol:	You and Nick, you and your brother. He was not afraid to speak out. Sometimes it was not the nicer thing, but he was very protective. I could go anyplace with him. He took me down to the gym he and Paul had. These were all rough people. It was it was a whole different environment.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I remember when The Godfather came out I was eight years old, in the movie. We went to movies all the time every Sunday but that movie, I remember, just had a big impact [00:30:00] on him because it was right. All the places he visited, the restaurants, the churches, the neighborhoods, where that film was shot, just brought back all the memories in the 40's, and he had the same name as Don Corleone and I remember the big thing was that he looked like the godfather. So when that movie came out, it was such a personal thing.Martha Al'Carrol:	He claimed ownership to that.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	It was his story. ""Hey, Don. You look like the Godfather, Don.""Martha Al'Carrol:	He did.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then on top of that, his best friend played the opposite mob family boss.Martha Al'Carrol:	Who was that?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Philip Tattaglia. The actor was Victor Rendina and he saw his best friend opposite Brando.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, he claimed property to it.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then he started doing his impersonations of The Godfather and even did some of the gong show here in Denver, that meant a lot to him.Martha Al'Carrol:	He was in the public eye, he danced, he was in plays, and he loved theater. He couldn't help himself, that's who he was. He did look like the Godfather. He did.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I remember that movie, the way it's tied in with his life.Martha Al'Carrol:	He was very protective of you kids growing up too. I had to intervene sometimes.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He introduced you to his family, which were from Italy, his parents were from Italy, and he was born here in 1910, so what was it being a Mexican-American?Martha Al'Carrol:	They didn't even know what a Mexican-American was. His mother called me La Española, the Spanish woman.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	The Spanish woman.Martha Al'Carrol:	Which to some degree, that's correct. It's funny because in New York too, they have their certain traditions. You'd think they'd have a worldwide with the United Nations being there, but they're very secluded. He was from the Bronx. If you're from the Bronx and you meet someone from Brooklyn, I think you specify where you're from.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	They're territorial, I think.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, they were.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I used to joke a lot that when you smell gunpowder or gun smoke, you knew you're in my neighborhood.Martha Al'Carrol:	But he wasn't violent. Actually he was a peacemaker, but he didn't like them. He didn't like injustices. There was no question about it. He would just speak up. No matter if we were in a restaurant or wherever we were.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Yeah. That's what I remember.Martha Al'Carrol:	He was just dying for someone to challenge him.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He was very protective of a man who were abusive to women. I remember him stopping people on the street if they were yelling at women and saying, ""I'm Detective Alcaro. What's the problem here?"" He'll just take on that role.Martha Al'Carrol:	He couldn't hold back all the time.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I was laughing too when you mentioned the Bronx. That's what he used to tell people how many languages he spoke. It was English, Italian, and then he'd say Bronx.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. He was a great dad.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then I have some photos, I have his album. He put together this photo album of all the places you dated.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	It took him eight years.Martha Al'Carrol:	Where did you find that?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	We had it buried away. But you met in '47, you got married in '55, so he was pursuing you for eight years. Then I have a photo here, now these are all the snapshots of New York in the 1940s. This is an interesting one. It looks like a Chinese theater or movie house. You have any memories of that?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah, we went to Chinatown and we went to the theater in Chinatown. We didn't understand what we were watching, but a couple behind us were translating throughout the whole thing. They were telling us what it was. But it just sounded like an interesting place to go. They have a sing-song way of talking, this particular Chinese movie. I enjoyed it without understanding it because the experience itself. We were surrounded by Chinese. And they were real nice to be [00:35:00] sure that we understood what we were looking at. We did a lot. We used to do a lot of things like that. Of course, he was a great dancer. He was a professional dancer. You have his album.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	He used to do some of those marathons too.Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. They had marathons.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	During the depression, yeah.Martha Al'Carrol:	They were dropping off like flies. They would just dance along. But he did real well, I think. Of course, he had a different dance partner then.FEMALE_1:	When did you come back to Denver?Martha Al'Carrol:	Let's see.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You stayed in New York for maybe four years?Martha Al'Carrol:	1961? 1960? I can't remember.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	No. You came back to Denver in the mid '50s. You got married in '55, then you stayed in New York, well, '47 to the early '50s.Martha Al'Carrol:	About 5-6, and then we came back here.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Then when your father passed away and then you came back here in 1960?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah. We were living in Long Island, New York and then we came back to Denver. He really liked Denver.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Did you see a change in New York from '47 to the late '50s? Was there a change in set?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yes. New York is a constant change. It's a fascinating city. I love New York, actually. I really enjoyed it. But I had good friends, and your dad used to take me all different places where he spent his childhood. There were little gangs where he lived and they used to take free rides on the streetcar. I don't know how they'd survived. They hang onto the cars that passed by and they take free rides all the way down to wherever they wanted to go. He was a real source of comfort. I wouldn't have gone some of the places. He took me to the lower east side and some of the areas that he was familiar with, especially where the athletes were, the boxers and the people that he knew, Paul Berlin back, who was a ferocious fighter, was such a gentle soul. I couldn't believe he was the same man.FEMALE_1:	Is there a happiest moment that stands out in your mind with Don?Martha Al'Carrol:	I think when we got married, we went to our honeymoon to Connecticut.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	You got married in Connecticut?Martha Al'Carrol:	Yeah.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	That was in '55. What was the connection with Marilyn Monroe's marriage or something? Was it the same church or the same day?Martha Al'Carrol:	The same day, I think.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	Same day or it was the same church, and then you went on your honeymoon. Where did you go on your honeymoon?Martha Al'Carrol:	Just to Long Island.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	I thought you went to Mexico.Martha Al'Carrol:	No, that was later. Yeah, we did go to Mexico. What he couldn't say in Spanish, he would say in Italian because he never picked it up. The Spanish in New York is different depending on what group. If you have Cubans or Puerto Ricans, they speak so fast and their structure of the language is jumbled. You have to learn how to do that. I'm not saying it's big bad or anything. No, it's just a different approach, a different way of speaking.FEMALE_1:	Was there anything else that you wanted to talk about today or any questions that you have for your son here?Martha Al'Carrol:	Well, he's a researcher, so he's done a lot of stuff and he's found out stuff that I'm not even aware of about my own family.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	We come from a family of storytellers. My mother spent time listening to her mother tell stories of her times during the Mexican Revolution as a nurse. [00:40:00] I heard one of her friends was a man called Mr. Berry in Evergreen, he was a cowboy. He was telling me stories as a seven-year-old. I had stories of him as a little kid-Martha Al'Carrol:	You remember that?Gregorio Al'Carrol:	-taking food to Jesse James. I had a connection. I'm one person away from Jesse James and I thought that was a remarkable, a 90-something year old man. He was telling me stories about the gunshot wounds that the Cole brothers were taken out of them when he was there. I remember, my gosh, I'm listening to something that was Martha Al'Carrol:	History.Gregorio Al'Carrol:	That got me inspired to keep asking questions.FEMALE_1:	Well, thank you both for coming.Martha Al'Carrol:	You're welcome. Thank you for hearing us. I think this is an excellent idea and I look forward to being able to maybe access some of this at some point.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
mby008559,"Scott Gilmore:	[00:00:00] Hello. My name is Scott Gilmore. My age is 47. Today's date is November 4, 2011. We are in Denver, Colorado and my relationship to my partner is, she is my best friend, and my life partner, and my wife.Stacy Gilmore:	My name is Stacy Gilmore, and my age is 41. The date is November 4, 2011. We're in Denver, Colorado and my relationship to my partner, Scott Gilmore, is all of the same, except he's my husband.Scott Gilmore:	I know we've always talked about how we met. So, how did we meet? Because I want to know if your perception of how we met is different than mine.Stacy Gilmore:	Well, I think about how we met was, I was finishing up my final year at Metro State College here in Denver, and I was finishing up with my Zoology degree and wanting to go to medical school. I had the opportunity to have a summer volunteer experience that was teaching kids how to fish. I didn't really know how to fish, but I figured, well, let me go and see. So, the first day I got up early, got ready to go, and I could not find the park. I drove around and drove around and at the last moment, when I was just like, forget it, I can't find this place, I'm just going to have to call them when I get back home and say, ""Something happened, I'm not going to be able to volunteer today."" I came up to a street and I was like, ""All right, I'm just going to turn left."" I turned left and I drove a little ways, getting my story together, like what I was going to call in and say, why I couldn't be there. I look over to my left and there's Wash Park and I'm like, ""Oh, man, all right, I'm here, I'm going to be late, but let me go on up, and go.""Stacy Gilmore:	I parked my car and walked up to the front doors. It used to be the old boat house at Wash Park, so it was before they remodeled it. It was this old dilapidated old house, old kind of big building, and there was this guy laying on the railing, it was an old stone staircase. So there was this guy laying on the railing reading a book and had on cut-off shorts. As I walk up, I'm like, ""Hi, I'm looking for the fishing program."" The guy sat up, and his hair was all messed up, he looked a little disheveled or whatever, and I was like, ""Hi, I'm Stacy"" and the guy was like, ""Hi, I'm Scott.""  I was like, ""Oh, okay. Well, I'm here to help out with the fishing program."" Stacy Gilmore:	So, we walked in and we started talking. We worked together all summer long. The last day of the fishing program, you asked me to go out for a beer to wrap up the summer. All summer long, you'd asked me out and I said no, because I was actually engaged to get married to somebody who I had dated since I was 16, and we'd been dating for eight years. So I'd said no, every time you'd asked me. For whatever reason I was like, ""Well, let me just go, and it was just a celebratory beer after a great summer."" We went, and I'll let you tell me how you met me, and we'll pick up the story.Scott Gilmore:	I don't remember being disheveled and having messy hair. I thought I was pretty hot and stunning, golden tan, but yeah I know, I've seen pictures of myself, I was pretty disheveled with my cutoff jeans and stuff. I just remember being up on the concrete porch and being really frustrated because my temporary who was supposed to be working for me never showed up. So I was pretty pissed off and lo and behold. Then other person I was working with, I really didn't like anyway, so here along comes this pretty young lady, coming up and saying she's going to volunteer for [00:05:00] the program, and that was pretty cool. Really, we didn't have our temporary, so I offered her.Scott Gilmore:	I asked her if she'd just like to go ahead and get paid for the summer, some of it. That seemed to work out well and we started teaching kids how to fish, which was pretty cool and we both enjoyed it. I would always ask her out for a beer and she'd say no. She'd say, ""I've got things to do"" and I'd say, ""What are you doing?"" and then she'd say, "" I have a test tomorrow."" I'd ask her, ""Well, how did you do on your last test?"" And she'd be like, ""Well, I got a 98, "" and I'd be like, ""My God, you need to get a C, we need to go have a beer."" That went on all summer and then eventually at the very last fishing clinic of the summer, she said yes, and we've been together ever since. I found out, this is how I found out. So we hung out, and parts of the story, we went to Paramount Cafe, which is on the 16th Street Mall, which is really fun, I used to always like to go there and have wings and hang out.Stacy Gilmore:	When we got there, lo and behold, it was two for one.Scott Gilmore:	I did not know that.Stacy Gilmore:	So when we order a beer, they'd bring us four.Scott Gilmore:	We did get doggy style beer too.Stacy Gilmore:	Anyway, we hung out that night, we walked along Cherry Creek.Scott Gilmore:	Cherry Creek.Stacy Gilmore:	Cherry Creek and just walk around downtown. I had called my fiance, and at that point I was like, ""Oh my gosh,"" I was silently freaking out in my mind, ""What am I doing? I'm having drinks with this other guy, I'm supposed to be getting married."" That was August 9th, 1994 and I was supposed to be getting married September 17th, 1994. So it was like a little bit over a month to my wedding date. I was like, ""What am I doing? What is going on?"" We were just having such a good time talking. We had so much in common, and about halfway through the night, I made the decision in my head that I was not going to get married, and that I was going to have to tell my fiance the next day. But I was just enjoying that night so much that I didn't want it to end. I remember we went back to someplace and I said, ""Well, I have to call my roommate and let them know that I'm not going to be home when I said I was going to be home."" So I called my fiance and said, ""I'm out with friends, I'm really sorry, I need to talk to you tomorrow, but I'm fine, I'm safe."" So that was that, and we went back to your dad's house,Scott Gilmore:	My dad's house.Stacy Gilmore:	In Montbello. About 2 o'clock in the morning, the phone rings.Scott Gilmore:	It's my boss, and he's like, ""Do you know where Stacy is?""  I'm like, ""Oh, I don't know."" I'm like, ""Why, she missing?"" as she's laying next to me, and he's like,Stacy Gilmore:	No, I wasn't laying next to you, I was sitting up on the couch.Scott Gilmore:	You were sitting up. Oh, well, Then we played that off, but then pretty quickly afterwards, I got another phone call and it was your fiance asking me where you were at and I did not know you had a fiance, so it was a surprise. That's how we met. At least that's how we started dating and going out. We pretty much have been together ever since that night.Stacy Gilmore:	There is a little bit of rockiness as far as having Scott helped me, which I would never recommend to anybody, but if you're not sure about who you want to get married to or getting married. He helped me address all of the, ""We regret to inform you that the upcoming nuptials of Stacy and so-and-so will not be happening."" He helped me address all of those and we got through the rockiness that way.Scott Gilmore:	We got to go on a honeymoon.Stacy Gilmore:	Yes, we did, because we had already bought the tickets to Seattle.Scott Gilmore:	Back then, there wasn't any problems with changing [00:10:00] names on tickets. We were able to change the name and visit Seattle.Stacy Gilmore:	We went to Seattle.Scott Gilmore:	Which was an adventure in itself.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah. It was fun. It was really fun, but then that was 17 years ago.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah, 17 years.Stacy Gilmore:	We have been together since then. We started working together and you got your full-time position with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, teaching kids how to fish, and then we started Environmental Learning for Kids together.Scott Gilmore:	When was that?Stacy Gilmore:	That was in 1996. We also had Sterling, our oldest son, in 1996 also. Sterling and Environmental Learning for Kids, our non-profit, are the same age. They're both 15 years old. We've been to Yellowstone National Park, to the Grand Canyon, to Mesa Verde. We've been all over.Scott Gilmore:	Took kids to San Antonio to go wild pig hunting. We've been quite a few places.Stacy Gilmore:	Environmental Learning for Kids, or ELK for short, is a science-based non-profit. Our mission is to cultivate a passion in science, leadership, and service in a diverse community of learners. The way that we do that is we teach children and their families about science and science careers, and the way that we do that is through going into the outdoors. We go hiking, camping, fishing, all sorts of different outdoor activities, but it's all tied back to science careers. The way that Scott and I figured out that we wanted to create this non-profit was that we both went to school for biology, well, for wildlife biology and we're both people of color and we really didn't know that this was even a viable career path. I remember from a really young age, looking through National Geographics and every time the brand new National Geographic would come, I'd just read it cover to cover and just think to myself, ""How do I do what these people are doing? How do I become a wildlife biologist?"" I remember even asking my high school counselor, ""How do I do this?"" They were like, ""Well, I don't know. Just go to school, go to college for something."" So I fell into this path. You had a little bit different path as far as school.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah. In high school, I actually didn't study a lot. It was a brand new high school in the Denver area and so we didn't really study a lot. I don't remember studying. I'd get decent grades, but one of my favorite classes was actually photography. Most photographers, that was my science class, which is not very good, but I think it's because we used chemicals in the class, but I took lots of pictures, and I liked taking pictures of people. But one thing that I started picking up was taking pictures of animals, birds, and bees on flowers, and grasshoppers, and just all different types of little animals, and just started doing things like that and thought they were pretty pictures.Scott Gilmore:	So, I moved through that and kept doing that, and eventually started volunteering as a naturalist, which for my neighborhood, was pretty weird, being a young African American Japanese kid. Not many kids want to take other people on nature hikes and show them birds and stuff. My father was not very, let's put it delicately, he told me, ""Get a job that makes some money and stop doing that volunteer work,"" which now he is actually quite proud of me because I do make a living at this. But he actually had a friend that worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife that sat me down and said, ""Scott, you're volunteering, you're a person of color? Maybe you should go to school for that.""Scott Gilmore:	So at the age of 26, I actually quit a full-time job at [00:15:00] a manufacturing plant that I'd worked at for close to 10 years, making pretty decent money. I applied at CSU, Colorado State University, for a wildlife degree. I got the word that I got accepted, and I went in the next day and I put in my two weeks notice, and I cried all day long behind my welding mask because it was the scariest thing I probably ever have done in my life, that I was quitting a job where I had good pay to actually pursue a dream that I might become a biologist, I might study snowy owls or something. I ended up probably the farthest thing from a research biologist. I work with kids, and take them fishing, and teach them about the environment, and it's been a fun ride, that's for sure. Very interesting, and we impact thousands and thousands of kids every year, and teach them about that they're our future. That's what's really critical, is that if we can't teach our children that they need to take care of this planet, we're in trouble.Stacy Gilmore:	We just went to CSU this summer. It's neat to be able to go back to where you studied at the CSU Mountain Campus at Pingree Park. We took, I think, right had around 25 ELK students this summer, and they got to do the high ropes course and even I climbed up on the platform, climbed up a rock climbing wall, and stood up on the platform, and jumped off onto, what is that called?Scott Gilmore:	I don't know.Stacy Gilmore:	You jump down.Scott Gilmore:	It's like Superman jump or something.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah. It was scary. I'm 41, I think it might be the last time I do that. It was a little scary.Scott Gilmore:	Actually, I had never -- I never did the ropes course while I was up there. The first time I did the ropes course was when we went up there as ELKs, when we went out with ELK kids. It wasn't something that students or maybe I was just drinking too much beer during that time and just didn't wake up when they did it. Well, they'd wake up early and go do stuff, and sometimes I was a little slow reactive in the morning. I never did the ropes course until we took kids up there to do it.Stacy Gilmore:	But it's great because we got to see the ELK students from the middle of Denver who live in the city up on a high ropes course and they get to look out and see, what is it? Long's Peak? The Mummy Range.Scott Gilmore:	It's the Mummy Range in Rocky Mountain National Park.Stacy Gilmore:	So, they get to stand up, and look out at this beautiful vista, and then jump off, and challenge themselves, and learn to trust other people. Then they also got to look in bird boxes and so learned a little bit about ornithology , and about different birds, and their nesting habitat, and everything, really anything about natural resources. About water, about geology, soil, wildlife, anything.Scott Gilmore:	Forestry.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah, forestry, our students learn about. There's just so many different opportunities that they get to learn about. We've actually gotten to take our kids everywhere we go because I remember when Sterling was a little baby and we were just starting out with ELK, I remember me taking him during lunch on an ELK field trip and taking him in the backroom and feeding him, while the ELK kids were out eating lunch, I remember they wouldn't leave me alone. They kept trying to come in and I'd be like, ""I'm nursing, I'm feeding."" They would be like, ""We don't care. We want to talk to you."" I'd be like, ""Scott, get them out of here."" Those are some of the same kids that now, like Andre, and Erin, and some of those original kids, they're turning 30 this year, and we've known them since they were 14 and 15 years old, so just starting high school that way.Scott Gilmore:	It's pretty impressive where a lot of our kids have ended up, all the kids we've worked with have ended up. Teachers, and worked for the Department of Defense, and biologists, and scientists. It's pretty phenomenal [00:20:00] that we've been able to do what we do and show these kids that they can be anything they want, and give them the support that they need. It's exciting to be able to still continue to do it. Even like last night, I got to go to a neighborhood meeting, which I wasn't really excited about doing it, but you asked me to, and I usually do what you ask me to. I took five kids to a neighborhood meeting where they got up in front of 20 older people from the community, and they talked to them about climate change. What I noticed was, I could have got up there and probably talked about climate change and they probably wouldn't have listened to me one iota. But because it was kids in high school and middle school, they actually paid quite good attention. It was pretty interesting.Scott Gilmore:	I actually thought of today because my new job is going to be deputy manager of Denver parks and recreation starting in two weeks. I got a call this morning about coyote issues. A gentleman was saying that he was comparing coyotes to neighborhood dogs, and he said, ""Well, my dog got out and it beat somebody. They euthanized it and we should just trap all the coyotes in the city and euthanize them all."" So I had to explain to him that they were wildlife and that we actually build our houses in their habitat, and that we had to learn how to coexist with them, and that there was things that we could do to try to minimize that. But as much as I talked to him, he just didn't get it. But I was thinking that he brought to me because of the presentation that kids did last night is maybe we can make it like a coyote crew of kids from Elk that actually could go out and spread the message like, ""Dumb people, these are wild animals and you have to treat them like wild animals, but that doesn't mean we get rid of them. We enjoy that they're in our neighborhoods, but there's things that we can do to minimize the conflict."" So I think that might be something I'll be looking at possibly trying to do. It just seemed like the people in the audience just listened a lot more to the kids than they would ever listen to me. They kind of proved it today because a guy when he called me, he actually was like,"" Those kids were amazing last night. They just knew what they were talking about."" Then when I tried to tell him stuff about coyotes, he's like, ""Well, you can tell me anything you want, but perception is that they're wild animals and they're going to kill my kid."" I was like okay.Stacy Gilmore:	You are a wildlife biologists and it does that. But that's good to know. Because the elk students last night, they were supposed to have a PowerPoint to help them with this presentation. I tell you, even adults, if they don't have that prop and don't have that tool to point to or whatever, they will really freak out. From the sounds of it, the elk students just used it to their advantage and they kind of made light of it and made fun of it. If they didn't have a graph that was part of the presentation, they were pointing in the air where it would have been up on the PowerPoint. So they rolled with it, and I think people appreciate that. I mean, I think so many times, especially adults, but then also society, they have such low expectations for our children and for youth that they set the bar so low, and that when a child makes it to there, they're like, ""Yeah, you did it,"" and then there's no place for them to go and so they get frustrated. I think something that we were able to do and that we really challenge our students and make sure that once they hit one milestone, that there's many more milestones beyond that, and that they have to graduate from high school and they have to go on to college.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah. You see so many parents now. I understand, continuating or graduating from middle schools grade, they have great parties, and then they go on to high school and the parents have these huge parties for kids that graduate high school. For me, it's kind of like,""No, get to college, [00:25:00] get your Master's degree, and then think about if you want to get your PhD, and then we might have a party for you."" Our expectations for our children in this country are so low now. It's not just children, it's almost like, I'm leaving my job now, and when I was talking to my boss, I was like, well, you need to replace me and hopefully you guys will continue the program that I've been running for the past 17 years and it could be really successful. Then she looks at me and says, ""Well, we're not going to find another person like you. So I don't think we're going to find somebody that's going to work as hard as you or do as much as you or accomplish as much as you."".I'm looking at her like, so you're setting yourself up right now to say the program's not going to be as good, that you can't find a person that's going to be as committed and dedicated and hold that person to a higher standard and say, this is what you need to shoot for. If not even this, you need to shoot for even better. Because, I mean, I teach kids how to fish. You just have thousands of people coming out of the woodwork to say, I can do a better job than him because that's a cool job and I think I could do it better and get more kids out and be more effective. It'd be great to hear somebody say that. But she was like, ""We're not going to do as good as you and we don't want to follow you because we don't want to fail,"" and so people already have in their mind that, ""I'm going to fail.""Stacy Gilmore:	Well, but you have set the bar pretty high. It's a national program and you teach thousands and thousands of kids. I mean, I think when Mayor Hancock appointed you into this position with Denver parks and rec, I was excited, but I was almost a little relieved because I don't think you could work any harder than you do or I don't think we could work any harder than we do, especially when we go on the southwest trip. That way, I think that it's always an eye-opener for our new staff or new people who start working with us, how much of an endurance test the Southwest trip to Colorado is, to the Southwest side of Colorado. We actually go for eight days, and how many years have we done it? It is this 11th? Or last year was the 10th?Scott Gilmore:	We took a couple years off, but I think we've done it about, probably 10 years, at least, 10 years maybe.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah. Why don't you to talk a little bit about that?Scott Gilmore:	For this portion, I think we've done it for the past seven years, every year. When I first started at the Colorado Division of Wildlife, a gentleman that I worked with, Larry Garcia, he was a wildlife officer. He asked me if I'd like to come down. He moved from Denver to the Cortes area, and he asked me if I'd like to come to Cortes, the Four Corners area of Colorado and teach some kids how to fish. They were Native American kids, they were actually on either the Southern Ute Indian Reservation or the Mountain Ute Reservation. You and I actually went down there, and I think we camped for about three or four years, we went down and we take either some other ELK students or students that worked with us or we took our kids.Stacy Gilmore:	I think we've always taken our kids.Scott Gilmore:	We had a great time because what we do is actually travel from Denver and we'd have a couple urban kids, primarily Black and Hispanic kids. We'd go down to the Indian Reservation, and we camp in the reservation and we'd actually teach Native American kids how to fish.Stacy Gilmore:	Irony.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah, the looks I get from people when I say, and I told them last night at the presentation, I said, ''We take a eight day trip to teach. I take these kids from Denver and we actually go on the Indian Reservation and we teach Native American kids how to fish."" The looks that people gave us when we say that, they're like, ""Native Americans don't know how to fish?"" I have to explain to them that on a lot of the reservations, it's sheer poverty, and it's sad to see how a culture and a people have been treated, and just been disenfranchised from what the American dream is. When we get on the reservation, I think one of the most powerful things that happens is, the children that we take down there from Denver [00:30:00] might not have the best life. They might not have a dad that's engaged or they might have a dad that's not there, mom that's not there sometimes, and because of other reasons, and so they think that their life is just horrible or that things can't get any worse, and we take them on their reservation and they see that it could be a lot worse, and that they have an opportunity to shine and to be successful in life.Well, a lot of those kids on the reservation don't even have that opportunity to escape that cycle of poverty on the reservation, so it's a very powerful trip. I think the kids don't realize, they like going on it because we're going to Southwest Colorado and we're going to go hiking to some Indian Ruins and we're going to stay in the Casino hotel. We're going to stay in a cabin and will camp for a few days, and we're going to have a great time. They see it that way, but as they get older, they'll see that it wasn't just a camping trip, that it could be a life changing moment for them where they realize that, I'm pretty blessed to have what I have.Stacy Gilmore:	Well, we've had a lot of life changing experiences on that trip. We've been doing it for a lot of years and I remember well. We have Sterling, he's our oldest, he's 15, and we have Samantha, and she's 12, and then we have Serenity, and she's seven. I remember taking Serenity, so on the tribal ruins trip, there's tribal ruins and it's from which tribe?Scott Gilmore:	The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe.Stacy Gilmore:	The Ute Mountain Ute Tribal ruins. It's a behind the scenes, there's actually pottery shards still on the trail, you climb down a ladder that's probably 20 feet down into the ruins, and it's a log ladder, that if you miss-stepped, you slipped, whatever, you're falling off the side of this mountain. It's an intense trip. I remember when Serenity was maybe a baby. Well, we would take her down in the backpack. But then she got too big for the backpack, so one year, Dwayne, one of the older kids in ELK, who's a high school student, he's like, ""I can carry her."" We had those shawls, and so we wrapped her around Dwayne. She was secure. I wasn't letting her go if she wasn't secure, but Dwayne carried her down.Scott Gilmore:	I think she was four or maybe that year.Stacy Gilmore:	That was an amazing trip. Just all the teamwork of all the ELK students.Scott Gilmore:	Working together to get her down into the ruins.Stacy Gilmore:	To get her down because they didn't want her not to be able to experience that. In this trip, she climbed down on her own.Scott Gilmore:	The last two years, she has climbed down on her own.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah, she climbed down on her own.Scott Gilmore:	She's been in those ruins every year of her life.Stacy Gilmore:	On trips at the cabin at Williams Creek cabin, kids have seen their first shooting star, they've seen the osprey.Scott Gilmore:	They catch fish.Stacy Gilmore:	The nest, and they've seen them catch fish.Scott Gilmore:	At Rocky Mountain National Park, we saw the space station go overhead. We saw the Perseids meteor showers at summer.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah, we've seen some amazing things.Scott Gilmore:	The bear.Stacy Gilmore:	Which bear?Scott Gilmore:	The bear at Golden Gate.Stacy Gilmore:	That's right.Scott Gilmore:	The bear I scared.Stacy Gilmore:	We were camping up at Golden Gate Canyon State Park, and we've been camping for 17 years with kids. I always thought it was a good sign that we've never had a bear come into our camp. We're very safe where we talk to the kids about not having any deodorant in their tent, no candy, not even water in their tent. They just switched their clothes because we don't want to have a bear encounter, we don't want to engage wildlife like that, and so we've been very safe and very blessed that way. Well, one year we had camped up at Golden Gate Canyon, we were packing up, I've never even really seen a bear in the wild, as much as we've been out. Here it was drizzling, raining a little bit, and a black bear is on the edge of the road and we're in our 215 passenger vans, all loaded up, ready to come back to Denver. I say, [00:35:00] ''Scott, slow down, there's a bear right there.'' Mr. wildlife biologist, eagle-eyed Gilmore, starts honking his horn.Scott Gilmore:	I had to tell the other van there was a bear.Stacy Gilmore:	I'm like, ""What are you doing?"" Of course, he freaks the bear out, and so he runs across the road and gallops right up the hill and it's gone. We're all like, ''What did you do?'' I think Scott felt so bad, but basically, that was my wildlife encounter with a bear. I saw its butt running up the side of the mountain because Scott honked the horn.Scott Gilmore:	I was worried about the kid's safety.Stacy Gilmore:	In the van.Scott Gilmore:	I was excited.Stacy Gilmore:	You were.Scott Gilmore:	I had never seen a bear either, so I got excited and I wanted to let the kids know it was there. I didn't know how else to do it. Cell phones weren't that prevalent then.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah, we could have called really quick. Then when we went to Yellowstone, that was the longest trip ever. We drive.Scott Gilmore:	We were going to Yellowstone for eight days to do some community service projects, some service learning project.Stacy Gilmore:	We reached in, we put the hemp rope back into an early 1900 conservation corps cabin that was built. That was an amazing trip, and the ELK kids blew the park staff away. They did so much work, and were so fast.Scott Gilmore:	I always just remember that we took a half a cord of wood, we filled up a van, basically every little knocking crania of that van with firewood. We had these beautiful fires every night in Yellowstone, underneath the stars and enjoyed, and when we got there, there was a fire burn because the Yellowstone had been burning up, so we could have one fire.Stacy Gilmore:	We didn't. I think were in bed.Scott Gilmore:	Nine o'clock every night.Stacy Gilmore:	If not earlier.Scott Gilmore:	We actually went and bought us the heater propane stove, so the kids could roast marshmallows on the stove.Stacy Gilmore:	We could at least sit around something warm at night.Scott Gilmore:	We've had some great adventures.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah, we went a lot of places.Scott Gilmore:	There's a lot more to look forward to.Stacy Gilmore:	Well, this year is almost over, but we'll still probably go snow showing.Scott Gilmore:	I'm not going.Stacy Gilmore:	Up at Rocky Mountain National Park.Scott Gilmore:	I don't like the snow, so I'm not going, you guys can go.Stacy Gilmore:	It's so beautiful.Scott Gilmore:	It's okay. Take some pictures.Stacy Gilmore:	You get a promotion, then you don't go with these.Scott Gilmore:	I'm old. I'm 47, I don't need to do that. I will need to sleep on the ground anymore. I have to sleep on a cot and most likely I need to sleep in a bed. I'll tell you I'm not going snowshoes because too cold. I really don't even want to go ice fishing because we don't catch a lot of fish. So you guys can do all the winter stuff. I'll be here in my office downtown thinking of you guys.Stacy Gilmore:	Well, that's okay. Well, you can just raise some money for us to do more trips because you know all the Elk kids want to go to the Galapagos Islands. They have a whole wish list of where they would like to go. Someday, I just know it in every fiber of my being we're going to be on the cover of National Geographic, and that they're going to be writing an article about all of the Elk students who have gone on to study science and become awesome biology teachers, and professors, and researchers, and this whole piece. Because really when you look at the national averages, especially for women and people of color, it's in the single digits as far as women and people of color going into science related fields in college. There's no reason for that other than they're not exposed to it early on in life and they don't have role models that look like them to say, ""You can do this."".Scott Gilmore:	Talk like them, understand some of the issues they have to deal with.Stacy Gilmore:	Especially being a first-generation college student. I remember me being fresh into college and not knowing how things worked and really my parents not understanding how it necessarily worked either, and how scary that was and how grateful Elk students are to be able to call us now. Thank goodness for cell phones and say, ""I hate it here. They don't like me. They don't understand me. I want to come home.""Scott Gilmore:	I don't have enough money for my books.Stacy Gilmore:	Yes, that's one we've heard a lot.Scott Gilmore:	Many a time.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah. Hopefully, Sterling, and Samantha, and Serenity [00:40:00] will carry on doing our work with Elk.Scott Gilmore:	They don't have a choice.Stacy Gilmore:	They don't have a choice.Scott Gilmore:	They don't have a choice but to go to college.Stacy Gilmore:	But I hope they continue on doing things with Elk.Scott Gilmore:	I don't care what they study. They'll fish. They'll take their kids fishing and hiking.Stacy Gilmore:	Especially when we have an Elk Education Center.Scott Gilmore:	Expose them to the outdoors.Stacy Gilmore:	That's the biggest thing now that we're celebrating 15 years, is that we want to buy 5.5 acres right in the front side of the Montbello community, and have 4.5 acres as a conservation easement so it'll never ever be developed. It'll always be a short grass prairie. It'll be wildlife habitat. We can have some hawk nesting boxes platforms, so there will be wildlife, and then have an education center on the final acre to really provide wraparound services. The Elk students aren't necessarily coming by our house in Montbello, which they do. Every third Friday we have about 30 people in our house for a leadership core meeting. The Elk students take over the Gilmore house in Montbello, but it would be great for them to have an education center that they can take over and have for themselves?Scott Gilmore:	Call their own.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah. They want a library in a go figure. I think they imagine the Harry Potter library, how they go into where they stay and they just hang out with the big fire and everything. That's what the kids want. They want something like that. I'm like, ""You guys I don't know if we're going to be able to do that but well, we'll try."".Scott Gilmore:	We'll get one of those propenist fires. Just turn it off and on.Stacy Gilmore:	There you go.Scott Gilmore:	There would be no wood.Stacy Gilmore:	They can roast marshmallows on that, maybe?Scott Gilmore:	Yeah. They can.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	Can I just ask? So you guys met and married and you started this organization. What has it been like working together and having been marriage together?Scott Gilmore:	I wouldn't recommend it for most people, because I bet it actually would drive most people to divorce. But it actually saved our marriage. I drank quite heavily and I'm an alcoholic and I believe I have not had a drink for close, it actually was today. Today's the fourth? It has actually been seven years and 11 months today that I haven't had a drink. I think if Stacy and I didn't have the passion for what we do with the kids and introducing them to the outdoors and all of that, our whole life would have been about going out and drinking together and partying and when that was gone, our marriage would've probably fallen apart because we wouldn't had nothing to grasp and hold onto. But we've had Elk and we've had the youth that we are trying to educate and teach about the environment. I think that really has provided us a very strong foundation to our marriage and to our family. Our daughter is seven years old and about a month ago she went out fishing and she caught 10 fish by herself with the spinning rod. Most adults don't even know how to use a spinning rod. Just things like that our whole family does together and we have such a good time. I think just Elk and just our passion for the outdoors and natural resources and youth has really given us something to hold onto.Stacy Gilmore:	We really have a good time together. That is what blows people away. On these trips we are together 24-7. We're not apart ever, but my mom and dad were that way. Your dad was in the military, but they were together quite a bit.Scott Gilmore:	Forty years.Stacy Gilmore:	I think that we just know when we need a little bit of time apart from each other. We don't argue, if we start to get frustrated with each other, we just go our separate ways for a little bit and go and we give each other looks every now and again, like ""What are you doing now? How're we doing this?"" But we are a really phenomenal, strong team together, and we have so much fun.Scott Gilmore:	[00:45:00] I think that's why people like to encourage one of us to get involved in any project that they have is because they know they get two for one. It's the Gilmore team.Stacy Gilmore:	Like the beers. Like when we met, it was a two for one. Who knows? Now we're the two for one.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah, that's the deal.Stacy Gilmore:	But they don't only get Scott and Stacy. They get Sterling, Samantha, and Serenity. We all come together as a package, and I think that's awesome.Scott Gilmore:	Pretty amazing. We're a good family.Stacy Gilmore:	That's great.Scott Gilmore:	We're an amazing family.Stacy Gilmore:	Yeah.Scott Gilmore:	They all take after me.Stacy Gilmore:	Whatever. We do really have a good time together. The biggest thing that Elk kids, when you ask them what Elk means to them, is it science, is it fishing, is it the outdoors? What is it? The only word they ever say is, it means family. It's like their second family, or for a lot of our students is their first family, really. We have a bunch of kids that over the holidays always come back. Like our door one year did not stop ringing over the holidays.Scott Gilmore:	I think that's a very important thing that we give the kids. Yeah, we teach them about the environment, but we show them our traditional, intact family. It's a couple that is together that love each other, that they can then are there for each other. It's not like the TV shows or nowadays where people get married and they're divorced in 72 days.Stacy Gilmore:	Or even with partnerships, even if it's a same-sex family, but it's still a family. They are together and that you have ups and downs and you maybe argue and what not.Scott Gilmore:	There's a commitment.Stacy Gilmore:	But there's a commitment there. So we have a good time, and I can't wait to see what the next 15 years.Scott Gilmore:	About 50. I'm only 47. Thought you want to live 110 or so.Stacy Gilmore:	I'm going to live to 100 at least.Scott Gilmore:	I got to get as most of I can out of my retirement pay. So I got to live to like 120. I'm going to get every penny can get out of it.Stacy Gilmore:	That's great.Scott Gilmore:	Yeah. It's been fun. I really enjoy being with you and just sharing my life with you. So I just want to say thank you.Stacy Gilmore:	Oh, thank you. It's been a great ride.Scott Gilmore:	We can go shopping. I got all those coupons in the car.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
mby008642,"Gilbert Martinez:	[00:00:00] Hello. My name is Gilbert Martinez, and I'm 32 years old and today's date is November 26, 2011. I'm in LA, Los Angeles, and I'm talking to my daughter, Crystal Martinez.Crystal Martinez:	My name is Crystal Martinez, and I am nine years old, and today is November 26. We are in Los Angeles, and it's really nice here.Gilbert Martinez:	So my name is Gilbert Martinez, and I'm 32 years old. This is my beautiful daughter, Crystal Giselle Martinez. She just turned nine years old, and we recently had a very fun birthday weekend for her.Crystal Martinez:	Yes, we did. Because on Friday, we went to Chuck E. Cheese. We invited our whole family right there. The best part was that we went in the ticket blaster and I got a Chuck E. birthday medal. On Saturday, we went to Medieval Times. It was so fun because some of our family from Arizona came just to see it.Gilbert Martinez:	They came from out of town, right?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	From afar.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah. The best part was right there, that they gave me a certificate. The king said my name on the microphone, and they threw me a rose.Gilbert Martinez:	Remember on that day, the king mentioned your birthday to everybody?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	You were happy, right?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah, it shocked me.Gilbert Martinez:	Go ahead.Crystal Martinez:	On Sunday, that was the last day of my birthday. On Sunday, we invited some of our family just to play pool, just to eat, and hit two piñatas. It was really fun because we just invited our whole family together.Gilbert Martinez:	So everybody was together and having a good time. So what do you think? You had fun the whole weekend?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah, it was really fun. Have you ever had a party like mine's?Gilbert Martinez:	No. I never had a party like yours because my parents didn't have enough money to afford a lot of stuff, but I was grateful for maybe the little birthday cake or the little birthday gift that they gave us. So no, it wasn't that big like yours, but I do it because I hope you can appreciate what we give you, me and your mother, so you can grow up to be a very nice person. So that's why we do it.Crystal Martinez:	I feel very special because my birthday falls on a holiday, and I feel like everyone is celebrating my birthday because no one goes to school that day.Gilbert Martinez:	You feel lucky that everybody doesn't go to school that day for you?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah, it's really nice.Gilbert Martinez:	All right, cool.Crystal Martinez:	Thank you Dad for everything. I love you.Gilbert Martinez:	Well, I'm here to tell you I love you too, and I hope you appreciate everything me and your mother does for you since you've been born. I hope that you appreciate everything that we do for you.FEMALE_1:	Hi, Cryst. What was your favorite moment during your whole birthday weekend?Crystal Martinez:	My favorite moment was in Medieval Times because we haven't been seeing our friends and family from Arizona that much.Gilbert Martinez:	Well, actually they come from far.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	So she was very happy that day.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	So tell me about your family. Tell me about the people that came to celebrate your birthday. Who was in the cast of characters?Crystal Martinez:	A lot of people like my grandma, my grandpa. A lot of them. I can't even think of how many they are. There was a lot of people, but mostly, it was other people that are close to us.Gilbert Martinez:	The one that showed up from Arizona was a good friend of my wife, her name is Alma, and her two kids.Crystal Martinez:	Jada.Gilbert Martinez:	Her kid's name is Jada and the boy is Alex.Crystal Martinez:	Alex, yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	Trust me, they had fun too with you.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	Because they left very happy. Put [00:05:00] it that way. They didn't want to go.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	They wanted to stay probably.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	We all had fun.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	Did you know your parents were going to throw you a three-day party to celebrate your birthday?Crystal Martinez:	No. I only thought it was one because they only told me about Chuck E. Cheese. They didn't tell me about Medieval Times and that party at home.Gilbert Martinez:	Actually, Crystal, it wasn't supposed to go that way because Friday, we were going to plan a big party for you, but the weather said that it was going to rain. So last minute thing, we just ended up going to Chuck E. Cheese, and it didn't rain so we did something on Saturday, and we did something on Sunday for you. So it worked out even better.FEMALE_1:	Okay.Gilbert Martinez:	So I think it turned out very great for all of us.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	I also have other questions. Sorry about that. Tell me about your your parents. How would you describe them?Crystal Martinez:	I think my dad is really kind because he always gave me whatever I want since I was a little kid. We always went to the beach when I was small. We always went to Chuck E. Cheese, Disneyland,  [inaudible 00:06:32] , and this is the best moment of my life.FEMALE_1:	Tell me about your mom.Crystal Martinez:	My mom, she always helps me with everything, all the problems I have. She's really kind and nice. She always helps me in every problem.FEMALE_1:	I'm curious, has your dad ever told you how he was as a kid? As a child?Crystal Martinez:	No, not that much, but just a little. The only thing he told me was that they didn't have that much money to afford that much things.Gilbert Martinez:	My life, I explained it to her before, that my parents didn't have much of the money, and the things and the discipline was a lot harder and different. So I always tell her that I'm totally different. I try my best to give her what I didn't have in my life. I tell her all the time to appreciate what she has everyday because other people don't even have not even close to what she has. That's what I tell her a million of times.FEMALE_1:	So Gilbert, did you ever get into trouble as a kid?Gilbert Martinez:	Yes. I was troubled.Crystal Martinez:	Troublemakers.Gilbert Martinez:	Yes. I was one of those troublemakers in the back of a class and always messing around, goofing around. But it was all because maybe I was looking for attention, or maybe because I needed something, and maybe I just went the wrong way. I really didn't have school like I should've had. So that's why I'm very strict with my daughter because I hope she doesn't fall in that same situation that I went through in my life. So I try my best for her to stay in school and try. I'm always behind her. Lucky I have a wife that's very educated.Crystal Martinez:	Smart.Gilbert Martinez:	Yes. In that situation because I'm not that very bright with books because of my background and my stubbornness that I did when I was a child, basically. So luckily, I have a wife that can help her out in that work wise and school. She's very smart, my wife is. So we're lucky in that way.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	So we both do our parts.FEMALE_1:	I wonder, is there a childhood memory, favorites, happy childhood memory, maybe around nine years old, like Crystal's age that you can think about?Crystal Martinez:	Like the best birthday you ever had.FEMALE_1:	Or you maybe hanging out with friends. How was that for you at nine?Crystal Martinez:	Best time.Gilbert Martinez:	Well, my favorite moments in my life was when I was small, I remember always playing with my brothers and sisters. Yes, my mother and my father were there, but they had to work. Basically, they were always working, and we always had my older sister to take care of us. So I grew up with my older sister most of the time. [00:10:00] Basically, the little stuff that we had, we had to appreciate it. Little toys and stuff. We didn't have much toys, so I was grateful for everything. But that's why I give you a lot because I didn't get it, and maybe too much because I take advantage sometimes, but it's okay because I never got it, so it doesn't bother me at all.FEMALE_1:	Do you have any burning questions for your dad that you've never asked of him?Crystal Martinez:	As you were a kid, when was your exciting moment in your house?Gilbert Martinez:	Exciting moment?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah, in your house.Gilbert Martinez:	Well, when I was a child probably, I -Crystal Martinez:	You can't think of one now.Gilbert Martinez:	It's hard because I always used to be with my friends a lot. Kids just play all the time in the backyard and stuff like that, so it was a little difficult. My moments were just playing with my cousins.Crystal Martinez:	[inaudible 00:11:19].Gilbert Martinez:	Yes. Those were my special days and special moment is always playing. We didn't have much, but we always got together and played in probably will little marbles and that's what was our thing. I think those were my special days, special moments, stuff like that, just playing with them.FEMALE_1:	How would you describe your daughter? If you can think of three adjectives.Gilbert Martinez:	Very, very, very spoiled. Very lucky. Very outspoken. I can go on and on because she's very bright. She wants to be always the number one. She's talented and all that, but she's very outspoken.FEMALE_1:	What does that mean? Can you tell me one time why did you say she's outspoken? What did she do?Gilbert Martinez:	She does this many times. Basically, if we're talking and I'm trying to teach her ballet dance and stuff like that. I try to tell her do this and she would correct me. I'm trying to tell her you do this and she goes, but I already did it. She wants the attention of all. She doesn't like me telling her what to do because she's very spoiled in that way. But I don't mind because I think I'm like that.FEMALE_1:	How was she as a baby?Gilbert Martinez:	How was she like a baby? I think she was very bright and very calm. I don't know what happened to that, but she was very calm and she always listen to me when she was a baby. She was small when born. She's always been, like I said, quiet when she was small, always laughing, always giggling and everybody actually spoiled her, all her aunts and grandmas. Everybody that I know family-wise spoiled her. Because she was my heart. She was my everything. Basically, everybody knew it and she was spoiled.FEMALE_1:	What are your dreams for her?Gilbert Martinez:	My dreams for my daughter is hopefully she can go to college and finish college for she will not have to depend on any man and she can be independent on her own and be a very strong woman and finish and get a good job and don't have to go through what a lot of people go through. I think I would want her to have an easier life than me and other people that were struggling basically. I would want her to stay in school and finish and basically be a good person.FEMALE_1:	So you're nine?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.FEMALE_1:	What do you think you want to do when you grow up?Crystal Martinez:	Me, I think I want to be a veterinarian because I always play with dogs. I always play with animals. I take care of them always. Because we have two dogs, when they're six, we always just take care of them by ourselves.FEMALE_1:	[00:15:00] For your daughter, what advice from your own personal life experience would you have for her, maybe as a kid, but maybe even when she's a teenager going on with her full life?Gilbert Martinez:	My advice to her is, don't take everything to the heart too serious. I think you should enjoy life and laugh about a lot of things instead of being mad and stuff like that. Because the more you get mad, you just get in trouble, make everything worse than it is. I really think you should just enjoy life a day at a time, and I think you'll be fine if you just laugh about everything. That's what I think.FEMALE_1:	Ten years from now, you might be listening to this recording. Can you tell me a day, a typical day for both of you? What do you do from morning to night? Yeah. You can start, Crystal.Crystal Martinez:	All we do is just stay home. Actually not stay home, like always go out to different places all day long.Gilbert Martinez:	But like what? Say like on a Saturday night or a Saturday or Sunday morning. What do we usually do on the summer? We always go to the beach.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah. We usually go to the beach or we go somewhere a little far, like Sea World.Gilbert Martinez:	She wants to know, what do we do that day on the beach? Ride bikes.Crystal Martinez:	Yeah. We sometimes ride bikes. We sometimes play games or we just walk on the water and on sand.Gilbert Martinez:	Basically, on a Sunday, we ride a bike and we actually go to this one splat where it's lonely but it's nice. Santa Monica, you go a couple of miles and we ride the bike and we stay there. We feed the birds, remember?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	We look at the kids play and it's a lonely area, but we both relax right there and we both play and talk. That's what we will do on a summer probably Sunday morning.Crystal Martinez:	Summer day.Gilbert Martinez:	Yeah. We love going out, me and her with my wife. We love going out, period.FEMALE_1:	Do you have time with your mom and then time with your dad or is it time with both of them?Crystal Martinez:	We usually have time altogether. Not that much separate.Gilbert Martinez:	I love being with my family. I enjoy being with my wife and daughter. Actually, whoever wants to tag along is perfect by me. The more, the better. The more people, the better for it could be more crazier, and fun. I love being with the family.FEMALE_1:	A fun moment besides her birthday party, is there one that stands out in your mind recently or maybe when you were smaller? Just one memory that stands out.Crystal Martinez:	The only thing that was really special was when I was small because I always got many gifts, many stuffs when I was small.Gilbert Martinez:	Like what day? Christmas Day, or birthday, or what do you think?Crystal Martinez:	The most thing was on Christmas Eve. That was the most thing I ever got on Christmas when I was small.Gilbert Martinez:	What did you get that you remember?Crystal Martinez:	I remember I got a Mickey Mouse chair. I got a Mickey Mouse TV, a big Mickey Mouse TV. I remember I used to get a lot of coloring books, a lot of chairs.Gilbert Martinez:	Lots of presents?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	I always spoiled her like I said. Something I didn't have, I gave her extra.FEMALE_1:	Describe the holidays, like Christmas Eve and just the holidays. What do you do?Crystal Martinez:	Because [00:20:00] we live in our house and our grandma's next door, when Christmas, we just go next door and we get all the presents and we just bring them over there and our family just count them. We just say all their name and we just give them gifts and open them.Gilbert Martinez:	On Christmas Day, Christmas night, we would usually just all get together. First, we have a bigger tree, like everybody. We do our other ornaments before that, and we have them. We'll have fan home as a family, put the tree, and what else?Crystal Martinez:	Mostly we get those socks and we just put stuff for-Gilbert Martinez:	Each other, right?Crystal Martinez:	Yeah.Gilbert Martinez:	We have our bagels socks.Crystal Martinez:	Giant ones.Gilbert Martinez:	We stuff on with gifts that we want or we can play around with jokes and stuff, but then we all give it to everybody.FEMALE_1:	Thank you so much for coming. Is there anything else you'd like to say to one another?Gilbert Martinez:	I do. I want to say that ever since you were born, that I really care about you. I really love you, and I hope that you appreciate what I do for you for you can grow up to be a good person and I love you very much. Okay?Crystal Martinez:	Okay.Gilbert Martinez:	Cool.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
mby008666,"Louis Anthony Perez:	[00:00:00] Louis Anthony Perez, age 31. Today's date is December 2nd, 2011, Los Angeles, California. Relationship to Father Greg is mentor, father. It just there's just so many titles that I can give.Greg Boyle:	I'm Greg Boyle. I'm 56 years old. It's December 2nd, 2011. We're here in Los Angeles, California and I'm with Louis Perez who is son, friend, employee, mentor, brother.Louis Anthony Perez:	Well, let's start off with the first question. I've known you, met you 20 years ago at the age of 13. We worked with each other, now at Homeboy industries. Let's give a little understanding of how that all started.Greg Boyle:	How Homeboy started?Louis Anthony Perez:	How Homeboy started.Greg Boyle:	Homeboy started in 1988 when I was a pastor of Dolores Mission Parish, the poorest parish in the city of Los Angeles, nestled in the middle of two public housing projects, Pico Gardens and Aliso Village, and at the time was the largest grouping of public housing west of the Mississippi. We had eight gangs there, when I started. I buried my first young person killed because of this sadness in 1988, and I buried my 179th about three weeks ago. Not all from that community, but now Homeboy Industries, where you and I both work, is the largest gang intervention rehab and re-entry program in the country. I get asked to do that sometimes. Anyway, we did a lot of things. We started a school back in '88 and then that brought gang members to the church. Then they said, if only we had jobs. Myself and the women in the parish, we marched around the projects trying to find felony friendly employers, and that wasn't so forthcoming. In 1992, we started our first business, Homeboy bakery. A month later, we started Homeboy tortillas in the Grand Central Market here in LA. Then we're off and running and now we have a huge place where 15,000 folks from all over LA County walk through our doors every year wanting to get tattoos removed and mental health services. We run seven businesses and you name anything that might be helpful for a gang member to redirect his or her life, and we tried to offer it. Now you run Homeboy bakery. But I met you when you were a little kid and because I go to all these probation camps and you were locked up. Wanted to talk about that part.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. I met you when I was 13 years old. They were asking for people who wanted to go to Catholic services and I had my face on the window because I was trying to get out of my room, came out, went to church, always read the Bible, I guess in a sense, my family been there, but quite never. The King James Version was a little bit always not capable of understanding all that. Got to church and you were talking about using the Parables book, converting them into homies' names. Instead of Matthew, Luke, and John, it was now Chino, Blakey, and Husky. I understood that, and I understood that the teachings that were going on and at the end of the service, you gave me your card and told me to come in, look you up when I got out that I deserved better and I still have that card's still to mint condition right now in one of my Bibles at home. Many people call you different names. Through my life, I've met a lot of people that have met you through the system. I call you G, other people call you Father Greg or other names. How did G come about? How did G start?Greg Boyle:	Probably was G dog first, I guess, that was in the projects with the gangs and the projects. I remember somebody a homey from this one neighborhood a gang, gave me this cap that said, G dog. In those days in the late 80s. Remember that?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah.Greg Boyle:	Dog, a dog, that thing. That was a suffix that was more common than it is now. I remember that one of the homies gave me a cap that said G dog on it. A woman who clean the rectory threw it away because she thought that gang members were calling me a dog. This was a big insult. [00:05:00] I found out about that later on, but obviously we've had a lot of carino, a lot of affection to it, but now they'll people just G for Greg.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. I call a lot of people, big dog and stuff.Greg Boyle:	Yeah.Louis Anthony Perez:	You've touched a lot of parts, you touched the big part of my heart and in my life just by constantly as growing up and going back to my story, just growing up and first time meeting you, when you gave me the card, growing up in East LA on the other side of Boulevard. The projects were in really an area for me to go to, so I think I hesitated from going there because of that. I didn't think it was a time or I didn't believe that I deserved to change my life at that moment. I continue to do the things that I did going in and out of juvenile hall, which it was interesting that every time I got there, it was like I would be there the time that you would be at certain location usually juvenile hall or Sylmar and the cards kept coming every time you see me. Finally I came to Homeboys-Greg Boyle:	In the probation camps.Louis Anthony Perez:	In the probation camps, you did my first communion in camp. Then I went to the 1848 office. One time I got there, you weren't there. You were out of town. But I showed up.Greg Boyle:	That was our first office that was back in long time ago.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. I ended up getting arrested after that. My mom took me. I showed up. I was uncomfortable because it was in my area. Then I got arrested and I 15 years old.Greg Boyle:	Did you have a gun with you that day?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. I showed up packed because I was thinking-Greg Boyle:	Packed means having a gun.Louis Anthony Perez:	Carrying a gun and stuff. I ended up getting arrested at the age of 15. I was looking at 25-year life just coming out of camp. Just because of the trust that was built up with you constantly, every time you see me, you never judging me, never looking at the bad things that I was doing. You gave me your phone number. I still remember it. Hopefully has changed, but it's 780-0303.Greg Boyle:	Thank you for telling the whole world. Actually, it doesn't exist anymore. I just changed my cell.Louis Anthony Perez:	I called then. I didn't call a lawyer, I didn't call my mom because of the things that were going on at home and you showed up and you just told me that things were going to be okay, that I just had to go through this and it was going to be all right and I believed you. I grew up in a normal dysfunctional home. The earliest childhood memories that I have is my father beating my mother from the bedroom to the living room. Me and my sisters slept on the pull down couch watching her as she was being beaten while me and my sister cried. That was home life for me and being incarcerated sometimes is better than home. He came into my life and I just had to go through what I went through. Lots of times people question, why? They look at a gang member and you never did that with me, and don't do that with anybody but lots of times people outside of Homeboys look at a gang member and they look at them and they just think that they less than or they don't deserve an opportunity or they choose to make the choices they make. What would you tell a person that doesn't understand what sometimes people like us go through?Greg Boyle:	Well, the hope is that you want to get people to a place of compassion where they can stand in awe at what you've had to carry, rather than stand in judgment of how you've carried it. Although your beginnings were in New York but you came here to LA, but you grew up in the gang capital of the world and so did I, growing up in LA, but I never would have joined a gang. I just didn't come from the same trauma, and pain, and rejection, and abuse. Just didn't, in just sort terms of the lottery. So I never would have joined a gang but that fact doesn't make me morally superior to you. Quite the opposite. The day won't ever come when I have more courage or I'm closer to God than you are. That's the absolute truth. So you want people to as soon as they can get in the neighborhood in the vicinity of somebody like you, gang member who has a past, then the hope is that awe will fill them. Awe and judgment can't coexist, one of them is going to have to knock the other one out of the ring and the hope is that awe will be the victor. Talk about drugs.Louis Anthony Perez:	My father was [00:10:00] an alcoholic, my mother was too. Just thinking of you being there for me, I remember every birthday or every Christmas I would received a letter from you. No matter where I was at I would receive a letter from you, and I looked forward to those letters. Looking back on my life, no matter how dysfunctional home was and looking at my mother and my father and the things that they did, I swore to myself that I would never be that. I thought that looking at their example would be a learning lesson to not follow that path. Unfortunately, at the same time I was seeking to get away from the reality I was living, and I was willing to experiment with drugs. I remember growing up the first things were coming out, I would steal alcohol, my mom was on an alcoholic bender and she'd be passed out on the couch. Because I didn't want her to drink anymore I would take the beer from the refrigerator and pack it up in my backpack with the ice, and I would jump out my window and I will go and hang out with the guys on the corner, and would drink it. We would smoke. They would come out with weed and they would roll it up and they would pass it to me, and because I was always trying to find something to take me away from the reality I was living, I was always willing to grab it. I smoked weed, they laced it with other things like PCP or crack cocaine. I was willing to do it, not willing to say no because I didn't want them not to like me, because I wanted to be a part of something. Little by little it got the best of me in a sense with methamphetamine.I remember I got out of juvenile hall and camp one time, and it was the summer and methamphetamine had just speed, they called it crank at the time. I just came out and I started to mess with it because I felt it allowed me to stay up, and be on the streets longer, and not be at home, and I didn't have to sleep at home and hear the things that were going on at my house. For the whole summer, I had just got out and I looked pretty healthy. I had the chest and area, and the biceps were growing and everything. I started to use the drug, and as it somewhere progress, one day I got a phone call, I ran downstairs to pick up the phone and my mother looked at me, and she began to cry and she was sober. My mother was like a Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde, when she was sober she was the most beautifulest, kind, loving person. But when she was under the influence, I was her scapegoat and I think everything that she suffered from my father she took out on me, because I reminded her of him. So I came down running down, answered the phone, she looked at me and she began to cry, and I looked at her and I said, ""Why are you crying?"" she's like, ""You look like skeletal."" I ran back up the stairs I looked at myself in the mirror and, no matter how much my ribs were showing and my bones and my knees were showing, the image that I had projected in my mind that I was okay.When I ended up being arrested, I started messing around with heroin, and while I was fighting my case and I was looking at the life sentence, heroin was a big thing in prison and being incarcerated and I started to mess with that. Seeing other people addicted, I always thought that I was different. When I got released at the age of 20, I went right back out to the streets and I continued to use heroin, and in one of those occasions I had got to that place where I couldn't stop. No more control. After that when I was in my bender and stuff and lost on heroin, I started shooting it intravenously and I ended up hanging out with one of my friends, Fat Boy, and there's another point in my life that was just when I reconnected with you I guess you could say in a sense. My friend Fat Boy I was living vicariously through his life. He was on graduate college, he was going to school, he was doing all the things that I felt that I couldn't do, and one day we're hanging out on the street corner, in the street and he said, ""I can't get a job because of the way I look I'm going to go to Homeboy Industries. I said, ""Go ahead, Father Greg did my first communion just don't forget where you come from."" Later on that day, I went home, he went home and he called me because we used to hang around the same street corner before. We used to walk together. He called me and I wasn't there to answer, he decided to walk by himself and he was gunned down, he was shot three times in the back of the head. I just couldn't [00:15:00] deal with it and I decided to try to kill myself slowly with drugs, worse and worse I ended up on Skid Row in downtown LA. As I was ending up in downtown LA in Skid Row, I thought about the last conversation we had which was with you. That's when I showed up at your office for a new chance, a new opportunity. I don't know if you recall, I came in asking you if you had remember me from camp, and I cried to you, lost.Greg Boyle:	Did I hire you?Louis Anthony Perez:	You hired me and you told me that come back Monday, that I had a job, and I started working out in the well, and I started doing good and we were in the process of starting my own-Greg Boyle:	The wells where you answer the phones and work on the computer.Louis Anthony Perez:	I remember I was working there and I started moving up to assistant job developer, and then Sarah was helping me to try to get a program that I was going to get guys, the young kids to take them out on a boat, remember?Greg Boyle:	That's right.Louis Anthony Perez:	Immediately I felt that I didn't deserve this and I sabotage and I went back to using drugs and went back to prison. I got lost on the streets. Father Greg why do you think that that happens? We've always talked about this, what is the thing that happen in an individual to transform?Greg Boyle:	What happened, the sabotaging?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah, the sabotaging.Greg Boyle:	I don't know. Well, first of all, you hadn't done recovery yet.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah.Greg Boyle:	So we didn't know what to do. Then it was a vexing thing. I remember the time at the Mexican restaurant, I don't know if we can tell this story.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah, tell it.Greg Boyle:	You came in and it was a last ditch effort, where you came and I said, ""Gosh, rehab."" We were eating Mexican food, I can't remember where, but you were living on Skid Row, and I said, ""I just need to take care of this ticket."" I pulled out my checkbook, it was $72 or something like that, and so I wrote it to the City of Los Angeles, said, ""I'm going to take care of this tomorrow, then I'm going to go into rehab."" But again, this is the movidas of a drug addict, right?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yes.Greg Boyle:	I find out later, and I think, ""Oh good, he went to rehab."" But then I find out from your girlfriend, Judy, who is now your wife and mother of your son and another one on the way, she said, ""He never went to rehab."" I said, ""You're kidding me. He took that check and cash, how could he check cash and it said City of Los Angeles?"" When you came in to see me, finally, like everybody, you ended up coming back and I said, ""How did you cash that check?"" He goes ""It was hard to get anybody to cash."" I go, ""Well, yeah, hello? Because it wasn't made out to you."" ""Then I finally, I found a guy who would cash it."" I go, ""How did he cash it?"" ""I just changed it a little. I fixed it."" I go, ""What did you fix it to?"" ""City of Louis Perez."" I swear, this guy. On what universe does somebody cash a check that says, ""City of Louis Perez?"" But then shortly after that, then you went to rehab?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah.Greg Boyle:	How long did you do?Louis Anthony Perez:	I did 15 months in the rehab. I did six months in the rehab, intensive rehabilitation, learning about the 12-step process. Then I did the rest of the time in a sober living, where I learned how to go and live life, and come back to sober environment without resorting back to going where it was comfortable to me. I remember because I was working and you laid me off for a time because I couldn't stay right. I remember I used to come in and I would bug you, and I would be like, ""Gee, I just need a job. I just need you to give me a job. "" You would be like, ""No, my son, you need help."" I couldn't understand what help was at that that moment until I actually started going through the process at the rehabilitation center in South Central Los Angeles. I stood there and I started going back to school and I started working the 12 steps, got myself a sponsor. I have over five years now, clean and sober, and I continue to work with other people, sponsor other people, and I continue to try to do the process and the things that the recovery focuses on. It changes your life, it's a big thing. After that, I went back to school to LACC, where I went full time student and I ended up getting straight A's, except the B in Spanish, I don't know what happened there. Then I came back to Homeboys and I showed up. I remember [00:20:00] the day that I showed up, you were walking out, you were going on a trip. I pulled up with Judy and drove right into the front. Got off my car, I shook Moreno's hand, and you were walking out. You hugged me and you shook my hand and you looked at me, and I was like, ""Gee, I just wanted to see about getting a job, "" and you looked at me and then you told me, ""You're ready."" I started to work and I've been there now ever since.Greg Boyle:	Now, you're a member of my council, which is basically the group of people who run the place. About 10 people, I guess. Half of them are homies who've moved up through the ranks, and now you run the bakery.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. Now, there's other people on the council. I couldn't see it back then, but I appreciate the sturdiness. You kept holding a mirror in front of me and returning the problem to myself, in a sense, where you allowed me to see that drugs were a problem. Growing up in East Los Angeles, you see people getting high or people using drugs and you think it's not a problem. But when it affects your freedom and affects the things that you do, then it's a problem.Greg Boyle:	You were returned to yourself, to the truth of who you are, which is, you're exactly what God had in mind when God made you. I think you've come to know that truth. Nobody inhabits that truth more than you, it seems to me. My favorite Louis Perez's story, this happened, remember when we went to Washington DC? You, me, and Big Joe. We spoke in front of a select subcommittee of Congress on gang violence. Then that night, we got to go to the Holocaust Museum because I'd been there many times and it's a powerful thing. So we had three hours, and I said, ""We'll meet in the lobby at 3:00."" When we came to meet at 3:00, you two were just blown away by this experience, and we're debriefing. Then we see this table, and there's a man in his '80s sitting behind it. There's a chair in front of the table to invite you to come and sit, because there's a sign on the table that says, ""Holocaust survivor."" I remember the three of us were going, ""Gosh. What would we say to this guy?""  One of the characteristics for me that's so unique in you is that you're fearless, absolutely fearless. Joe and I were going, ""Gosh, what would we say to him?"" You go, ""Well I'm going to go sit down and talk to him."" So you do, and I know the story line because you told us afterwards.So you walked up and you just right out there said, ""So what camp were you in?"" His name was Jacob, and he said Auschwitz. It turned out he was just a young boy, maybe 13 or something, and both his parents were killed there and his sisters were murdered right in front of him. His niece and nephew were executed right before his eyes. He was a worker, so they spared him. Then he told his story, and then you listen to him, and then you pulled your card out of your pocket and handed it to him. You introduced yourself, and said, ""I work at Homeboy Industries, which is the largest gang intervention program in the country. I hope you'll come and visit.""He looks at the card and then you said to him, ""Well, however old you were, you were 27, you said, ""Well, I'm 27 years old and 10 of those years I spent locked up,"" and he got dismissive. He said, ""American prisons. You have your own room, you have a bed, you have a pillow. We slept on wood planks,"" he says, ""If you said one word in line, they'd pull you out and they beat you up, just for speaking."" Then you said, ""Yeah, I've been beat down many times at county jail. Once I spoke, they pulled me out of line, they beat me so badly that it looked like the elephant man when they were done with me, and they threw me naked in a cell and I slept on a metal sheet."" So you're telling me this and then I stop you at that point. I said, ""Okay Louis, let me see if I got this right. You were comparing your experience to a Holocaust survivor?""  You were very clear eyed, I remember how clear eyed you were, you said, ""No, nope, I wasn't comparing."" There is no comparison between what I suffered and what he suffered, what I've been through and what he had to experience in Auschwitz. Then you stop to think for a second, and I remember your eyes filled up with tears and so did mine, [00:25:00] and you said, ""No, I wasn't competing with him, I was connecting with him."" I'll never forget that as long as I live, because for me it's a story about your greatness, and that in the end, it's about connection. It's about taking the truth of who you are and the pain of what you've been through, and then connecting it to other people's pain. That the measure of our compassion is not in our service, but in our kinship with each other. That's one of my favorite Luis Bella stories.Greg Boyle:	The big picture of the reason of where I'm at today and not imprisoned for the rest of my life for lust, slamming heroin in my veins is because of you. Because you helped me see what I couldn't see. It's hard, you've been doing this for over 25 years already, and we're barely scratching the surface with myself on time, doing them myself. How do you continue to keep yourself to keep doing what you've done for me, for so many people that continue to keep coming through our doors? Like today before we left, the line was looking like they're passing out free turkeys or something. There were so many people and I find it difficult sometimes for myself, even though I've been there, I always have to revisit where I am at. But how do you continue to do what you've done for me, for so many people?Louis Anthony Perez:	It's a privilege of my life. I wouldn't trade my life for anybody's. Although I have to admit today, it was crazy when we were leaving. But it is pretty heartening to watch you, I see how you are with all these young knuckleheads who come through, who maybe they've got one foot in, one foot out. They want to have a life, but they don't know really how to conjure up an image of what it ought to look like. You're the image, you're what recovery looks like. You're somebody who loves his kids more than he hates his enemies. This is what it looks like, and in the end, I can point them in the right direction, but only they can walk through the door marked life. I can help them get a life. I just can't give them the desire to want to have one. But when people have a hard time visualizing it, they look at you. So the day will come when I'll go to my reward or however they say that, and I feel confident that you'll carry the place on because you get it in your soul and it's part of the air you breathe. So these kids come in and they don't even know if they want it, but something compelled them to walk through the door, and you know exactly how to grab them by the ears when they're gang banging still. Or also how to say, look, I did the same thing, and you embody this idea of if you don't transform your pain, you're just going to continually transmit it. So that's heartening to show up at work and see you working, see you at work, see you in conversation with these kids, and it's full circle. I remember you when you were a little knucklehead kid, and you weren't go to listen to anybody. But I knew who you were. I saw who you are, I saw the goodness, and the goodness was undeniable, then you end up being too busy loving folks to ever be disappointed in them. With a no matter whatness, you just come back, keep coming back. Then the day will come when we can look at each other in the eye and say, yeah, you're ready, and now you're saying this to kids, don't you think?Greg Boyle:	Yeah. Now I agree. The whole thing about Homeboy, it's been built to this place where we have [00:30:00] so many people that are transforming their lives. It's all about holding stories. Tattoos on The Heart, it's been the number one seller on Los Angeles times, and it's all about holding stories. So my question is, do you have another book that's coming out that you're working on, and stuff for the people? I think when people tell me that they've read the book, they always tell me about how powerful, impactful those stories are, and I think that those stories are what brings kinship to us. Instead of sitting back and judging, and we listen, we have an opportunity to see what God has really created, and how we need to love each other to be a better society and a better place. What do you think, it's two questions, if you can write another book, what would be the title for others to have the opportunity to see what you've seen in your life?Louis Anthony Perez:	I don't know if I have another book in me. I have been asked to write another one, I guess. It's just more stories. Again, you want people to put a human face on an enormously complex social dilemma, and how do we have reverence for that complexity? So more stories about you and about a lot of the homeless who will walk through there. Maybe I have another one in me, but that'll be yet to be seen. So what do you hope for yourself and for Homeboy?Greg Boyle:	Right now we're growing in the bakery and we're doing good. There was a question one time, when we first went on talks and they were like, what do you want do? I was like, I'm going to take Jesus' job. You know what I'm saying, I remember we went with Tyler, and he asked that question out in San Jose, Bellarmine.Louis Anthony Perez:	That's what I want to do. I want to be able to do for others what you've done for me. Give people a life, an opportunity to see that there's so much more than the things that they see outside their windows when they come out in their neighborhoods. Hopefully I hit the lottery or become a millionaire somewhere down the line to continue to fund and build more. I just have a big vision of where we're going to go, and what we're going to do, and how many more people we can impact. I'm just grateful. My first communion, you married me and my wife, you baptized my son, and my daughter that's coming too, you're going to baptize her too. You've been my father, my friend, and you've been the person when I felt the most alone and unsure, you've been the person that's helped me redirect everything in my life, and I thank God for that. I questioned God for many years when friends would pass away, or things would happen at home, I would think like, ""Man, where's God at?"" God's in people all around us, and you've helped me see that God's real. When I see Sahul, or I see little Danny, I see God in that. That helps me be the better person inside, and I just want to help them. That shows me God. It's just trying to find God in everything around us. My vision is just how can we continue to grow and teach the way that we are ready to allow the people to see that.Interviewer:	Sahul and Danny, those are your kids?Louis Anthony Perez:	No.Greg Boyle:	No. They're just two knuckleheads, young workers who are very handful.Louis Anthony Perez:	Two kids that are still in the process of transformation. My son's name's Diami, and my wife's name's Judy, and my daughter, she still unknown in name.Greg Boyle:	When is she due?Louis Anthony Perez:	In March.Greg Boyle:	But you know it's a girl.Louis Anthony Perez:	It's a girl. I was scared of a girl, I was like, ""Oh, another boy,"" and I'm grateful [00:35:00] that it's going to be a girl. Just want to be the best father I can be, I just want to be their hero. I want them to come for me to guidance, I don't want to be looking at them through a glass window in jail. I want to just be as much present in their life, and be the person that they can come to for anything. What do you want from Homeboys future?Greg Boyle:	I don't know. I'm not big on grow, grow, grow, grow, grow. I like who we are. If it can be a model for other cities, I like that too. I don't want us to become the McDonald's of gang intervention programs, franchisable but more, if people want to learn from this thing. But I think Homeboy is concrete help for lots of folks like yourself, and Danny, and Sahul who are hard-headed and thousands others who've come through our doors. But it also announces a message, it's a prophetic place, really. What if we were to invest in people rather than just seek to incarcerate our way out of this problem? Cesar Chavez once was asked by a reporter, ""Wow, these farm workers, they sure love you."" He said, ""The feeling is mutual."" The feeling is mutual between you and me, and the mutuality of it is the one of the greatest gifts of my life. It's not about service provider or service recipient, it's about mutual. It's mutual, and I'm grateful for that. I love you very much, and I'm grateful that you're in my life. I'm glad you're running the bakery and not me.Interviewer:	For the record, if you were to walk into Homeboys industries or around that area, what do you see?Louis Anthony Perez:	A community. You see people embracing each other, guys from different neighborhoods, different races, different backgrounds connected. It's interesting just the energy and the vibe that you get when you walk in there, it's like a tribe in a sense. It's like its own little village when you walk in there. Many people with many scars and wounds that are helping each other to heal from them.Interviewer:	How many people work in the bakery?Louis Anthony Perez:	We have right now 49 bakery employees. We service 24 Farmers Markets. We're getting into high-end hotels like the Renaissance in Hollywood, and Marriott, and we're continuing to look for more people that want to bring their business to us. We have the best artisan handmade bread out there.Interviewer:	There's also Homeboys Torteria?Greg Boyle:	No. There's Homegirl Cafe and Homeboy Diner in the City Hall. As Luis mentioned, we're in all those Farmer's Markets as well. Homeboy Silkscreen where we screen print and do embroidery, solar panel installation training program, Homegirl Cafe, Homeboy, Homegirl Merchandise where we sell our logo stuff. We have all these businesses.Interviewer:	For the record, you mentioned your friend, fat boy. What happened with him? Why was he gunned down?Louis Anthony Perez:	Growing up in East Los Angeles, we were from where from a gang that had a lot of rivals fighting for a territory of block that we have no ownership of. But as he was walking, a person that we would consider an enemy, drove by and seen them walking. They were looking for somebody, and they ended up finding him. The guy got off, he ran up behind him, and shot him three times in the back of the head. It's a part of gang lifestyle.Greg Boyle:	Gang banging.Louis Anthony Perez:	Gang banging.Interviewer:	Was this something you were already used to seeing [00:40:00] in the streets?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah.Greg Boyle:	Yeah. You had buried other friends?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. Of course.Greg Boyle:	I've been to funerals for some of your own boys.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. Now there's countless others stories. That one one impacts me a lot because it was the last conversation before I showed up at Homeboys. But yeah, it's a normal way of living.Greg Boyle:	He was on his way to Homeboy.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. He was talking about going there. Growing up, it's the lifestyle that's on the streets. It's very ruthless and very violent when you're out there.Interviewer:	You mentioned you fell into the deeper hole or depression right after that?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yes.Interviewer:	Then you remember the conversation about Homeboys, how long between fat boy being shot down and you going back?Louis Anthony Perez:	Maybe about six months or so, it was a couple of months. The first thing that comes to mind of a person that's involved in gangs is retaliation. But no matter how much he retaliate, you never bring a person back. Then it becomes into anger turned inward, it's depression. You're hurt, and you get angry, and then you go out there, and you try to take it out on others. At the end of the day, all that anger gets turned inwards, and it becomes depression. You just try to find something to get away from it, and that's why I started using a lot of the drugs and got caught up in that.Interviewer:	One last question, you mentioned the knuckleheads, Sahul and Danny, how old are they right now?Louis Anthony Perez:	Danny is 16 years old, and Sahul just turned 18.Greg Boyle:	He's 19.Louis Anthony Perez:	19.Interviewer:	Do they work for Homeboys?Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah.Greg Boyle:	Yeah. One's part time, one's full time.Interviewer:	At the bakery?Louis Anthony Perez:	No. At at the main office right there.Greg Boyle:	No.Louis Anthony Perez:	The bakery and the main office, and the Homegirl Cafe and the Merchandise is all under one building.Greg Boyle:	All the same campus.Louis Anthony Perez:	Yeah. We crossed paths all the time and stuff like that.Interviewer:	Thank you for coming.Louis Anthony Perez:	Thank you.Greg Boyle:	Thank you very much.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
mby008684,"David Siew:	[00:00:00] Hi, I'm David Siew. I am 20 years old. Today is December 4th, 2011. We're here in Los Angeles, California. I am a student at Pomona College and a friend of Christian who worked at Pomona College.Christian Torres:	My name is Christian Torres. I am 25 years old. This is December the 4th, 2011, and we are in Los Angeles, California. I used to work for Pomona College and I'm a friend of David.David Siew:	Christian, when you say you used to work at Pomona College, I even stumbled over saying that you worked at Pomona College. Why don't you work at Pomona College anymore?Christian Torres:	Because they just fired me this week. Actually, they fired 17 or more people. We were 17 total, because they made this audit on all employees' paperwork. They said they found some deficiencies on some workers, and 17 of the workers got fired including me.David Siew:	So one of the reasons that we're here is because we want people to know a story about what happened at Pomona College in the last couple of weeks with them unjustly firing 17 dining hall workers, but we'll come back to that story in a couple of minutes. For now, I think it might be a better idea to introduce each other. So Christian, I was wondering when you came to the US and what brought you to the US?Christian Torres:	My parents brought me to the US.David Siew:	After you were living in the US, you began to work at Pomona College, what year was that?Christian Torres:	I started working at Pomona College in 2005.David Siew:	What position did you start in at Pomona?Christian Torres:	I started as a dishwasher.David Siew:	At the point when you were fired, what were you doing at Pomona?Christian Torres:	I was a cook.David Siew:	Okay. What was your path from being a dish worker to becoming a cook?Christian Torres:	I just wanted to increase my work, or to get a better position, or grow up as a worker.David Siew:	What other growth have you seen in yourself in the time that you've spent at Pomona College?Christian Torres:	I think in my leadership, it could be that. To try to tell my co-workers or to show my co-workers not to be afraid to talk to the managers if something is wrong with them, or with the work, or if they don't feel like they're treating them well. So they can talk about it. So that's something I felt that it changed to me.Interviewer:	But where does that leadership come from?Christian Torres:	When I got involved with the Workers for Justice, that's when the workers decided to stand up and fight for the process to form a union. That's when Workers for Justice was created and I get involved with that. It's 90 days since then, I feel like something changed me, the leadership.Interviewer:	What made you want to join Workers for Justice?Christian Torres:	I really don't understand the question.David Siew:	What things was the college doing or managers doing within the workplace that made workers feel like they're being unjustly treated?Christian Torres:	The work, it was hard, but as a worker I was afraid to tell anybody how my work was, and so were my coworkers. So many workers got injured, their wages were very low, and we didn't have work during summer. So we only worked for nine months for Pomona. During summer, we had to find another place to work because we had to pay rent, [00:05:00] or they have to feed their families. Everybody was afraid to fight because of that. When the workers went out of public on March 2010, the one Worker for Justice Organization was born, so to fight for a fair process to form a union. Because of the reasons, I decided to join them too. Because I see that my co-worker are fighting for justice because the workplace wasn't so fair as we thought. So many workers who also have been there for more than 30 years were earning $11, and some of the workers for 10 years or 15 years even, they got injured at work and they just got fired. That's why I decided to join them to fight for a fair process to form a union because we thought that the union, it's going to protect us against all these injustices.David Siew:	So in terms of your leadership with the Workers for Justice Organization, I've often seen you speaking at various events, and I've always been impressed with your speaking. I understand that when you came to Pomona College you didn't speak any English, is that right?Christian Torres:	Yeah. When I came to Pomona College, I took some ESL lessons in an adult school.David Siew:	What is ESL?David Siew:	English as a second language. How I'm I going to say it, I didn't work so hard on my English at that time. Then I came to Pomona College, I worked there and I started talking to some students and one of them told me that he was making an ESL program in the college tutored in by the students and I joined them. So I took these ESL lessons for, I think four years in a row. Since then, I feel very confident talking in English now, I can make any speech in English. I was so afraid even to talk in front of people in Spanish and now I can talk to a bunch of people even in English. It had been a burden because of the hard work of my tutors, especially the students who spent so many time with me. Also, instead of the ESL 2, I was taking this GED program to get my GED diploma, and tutoring by the students too. I was about to finish it when I got fired.David Siew:	Along with your personal growth in terms of your speaking and the confidence that learning to speak English has given you, has this confidence translated into other areas in your life?Christian Torres:	Yeah.David Siew:	What would those be?Christian Torres:	Before, I used to ask for help, translate to me. Even if I understand what they were saying, I had to get a translator. Now, they ask me to translate to English or to Spanish. All my co-workers came to me and they brought me recipes that they don't understand in English, and they came to me and they said, ''What does it say?'' Or ''I want to talk to the manager.'' or ''Could you tell this to this guy?'' They asked me even to translate that, and I feel very good about it.David Siew:	Do you think that this confidence has translated into you cooking better food at the school?Christian Torres:	Yeah. My cooking or my work as a cook. Since I came to the US and up to the next year, I start working in kitchens and I work I think for six different restaurants. When I came to Pomona, I started washer but I knew I have some cooking knowledge already. When I get to the cook position, some of the experience I have [00:10:00] I put it on my work and I think so many students have seen it. Even managers, they saw that I worked differently than the others because of my restaurant experience and they like it. The managers before the new administration but, and they like it. They used to give me all the confidence to make whatever I want for my menus and even the students like it. They were so impressed when they saw me making stir-fries or pastas. I saw very good comments on the comment board about me and that makes me feel very good.David Siew:	Do you feel this connection you have to the students through cooking food, do you feel that's translated into a strong feeling of connection with the Pomona College community for you?Christian Torres:	Yeah, absolutely.David Siew:	Would you say that this connection with the Pomona College community is something that a lot of workers at the cafeteria feel?Christian Torres:	Say yeah, because I'm only been there for seven years. I went there for 7 years, but imagine what I did in seven years. Imagine what another person who been there for 30 years did with students. When these events, when the alumni came and we do these events to them, discovering events, some of the workers go to these events. Some alumni who came, who were even 20 years ago, they recognize these guys and they just came to them and say, ""Hi. I remember you,"" and all those stuff. That makes me feel very good too because if they've been there for 30 years and even these guys came, they pass a very long time, a pretty long period of time and just to remember these guys.David Siew:	Well, for me as a student, one of the things that makes me feel strong connection to dining hall workers is that these are the people that provide me with food and that clean up the dining hall and do all things for me. So they become like a very central part of the family that I've created for myself at the college because without parents or grandparents there to be there comforting you, to make food, even the people who swipe me into the dining hall, you have to create these relationships that you expect to have with people. You have relationships with professors and with friends, but those aren't the people that are providing you with the sustenance that keeps you going.Christian Torres:	That's really where the students are for us. Those every people, like those people who seen every day. We see every day. You as a students, when you go to the dining halls, you'll see the same people every day. When you swipe your card, you see the same girl or when you go to the kitchen, you see the same cook. Same as a worker. When we made this food and we put it out on the table and then you came and the next day you came. So we see you every day.David Siew:	More than just every day, we see you three times every day.Christian Torres:	Exactly. For four years, the period you as a student be there.David Siew:	I think I can't necessarily speak for every Pomona College student, but as a member of the student community at Pomona College, I think that all of us as students have very strong connection with dining hall workers. So in the last couple of weeks, it's been incredibly hard for us as students to imagine that those people that we see every day, that swipe us into the dining hall, that cook the food for us, that we see cleaning up spills, that we see at the end of meals cleaning up tables, that we see doing all things for us, who become like our brothers, like our sisters, like our mothers, our fathers, our grandparents, when I think about that those people aren't going to be in the dining halls when I go back to breakfast on Monday, I feel incredibly insulted by the college. I feel somewhat disgusted by the actions of the college and I feel extremely sad. It makes me feel I want to do everything I can to help the people who have been fired to get food and have some resources for the holidays. [00:15:00] It makes me feel I want to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again at the college. What happened three weeks ago on Monday?Christian Torres:	Monday, the 7th of November, the 7th where we got this letters from the administration given by the General Manager saying that they made decision and we had to meet with the Human Resources by the date at November 11th, because they found some differences on our documents. That what everything they said and we had to meet them immediately. We went there and first of all, because we were fighting to get a fair process to unionize the workers, especially dining hall workers get organized very quick or they were organized. So when we got this letters, all of them start moving. ""What are we going to do?"" and start talking to each other, ""let's do this and everything get a plan."" Because we were working for justice, the workers, and supported by UNITE HERE. We try to find a way to fight against them because we thought that it wasn't fair. They don't have to do this because, I don't know. We went to this meetings with the HR and they said over there that we have until December the 1st, to provide our documents and if we don't provide those documents, we might get fire. On last Monday, we got another letter saying that if we don't provide our documents by Thursday at 05:00 PM, we should not report to work on Friday. Instead, we had to get to the HR department and get our last paycheck. We talked to the HR, we told them that they had already have our documents and they did not accept the same document we had. They didn't accept it and we got fire. Seventy people got fired.David Siew:	What was the thing that spawn this investigation? What originally started the investigation?Christian Torres:	They said that there was a complaint to the Board of the Trustees saying that the Pomona's College policy to hire workers wasn't appropriate, and they made it for it.David Siew:	I think one interesting thing about at least what the administration has conveyed to the students in the faculties and to the workers is that, there was a complaint made to the Board during the spring of 2011 in which someone said that the college was promoting practices of hiring undocumented workers. What the Board did was they hired an investigation firm. I think that one thing that's important to note about the investigation firm that they hired, is that on their website, they have a history of situations in which they entered in order to stop unionization processes, and they show that they've been very successful in that. I think it's also important to note that five of the most influential members on the Board work on Wall Street. Paul F. Ron, who's the chairman of the Board, works for Goldman Sachs, and he's been the one who's been giving information to the students about what's been happening. I think another interesting thing that's important to note is that the college has been incredibly unclear with workers, students, [00:20:00] even with the administration itself it seems about who wrote the complaint. No one will say who wrote the complaint, other that they say it was an employee. There's a suspicion that it was possibly a disgruntled employee. Another interesting thing is that, although the complaint was filed in spring, the college didn't begin to make anyone aware of the complaint until November 7th, and they only gave the workers three weeks to correct their I-9 forms. It is true that people were going to human resources and asking for the forms during the week after November the 7th, and the college was withholding the forms, which is actually illegal because workers are supposed to be given I-9 forms when they're asked for. Is that is that true?Christian Torres:	Yes. We asked for those I-9 forms, and they took more than a week for them to give us. They gave us at that time because we were pushing them every day. We were at the HR every day, and they said that they really was so busy, and they're going to provide us but they didn't give us any date. So because we were pushing them, they give us after a week.David Siew:	The letters that were sent out to 84 members of the Pomona College community were sent to faculty, students, and staff. What did the letter say, Christian?Christian Torres:	It says that a complain was made to the Board of Trustees saying about the Pomona's policy hiring, and they had to made this sorted, and they found some deficiencies in some workers' paperwork, and we have to make this appointment by November 11th.David Siew:	Did the letter give any specifics as to what was wrong with your papers?Christian Torres:	No. To know what's going on with the paper, we have to make this appointment.David Siew:	Interestingly enough, one of the professors in a forum that was open for students to come to said that when he went to the Human Resources department and provided his passport for them so that they could correct his forms, he asked them what had been wrong with his papers, and the Human Resources department couldn't tell him what was wrong with his papers. Because only the investigation firm knows what was wrong with the papers. I guess as soon as the college or at least the administration was made aware of this complaint, it was up to them to decide both how to handle the investigation, how to handle the way that it treated the workers, and when to set a deadline. What the college did was it to set the deadline of December 1st, David Ox to be the President of Pomona College in that faculty meeting said that the reason that they set the deadline of December 1st was in order to make the process as speedy as possible. He framed it as though the college was protecting the workers from an ICE raid by making such a short deadline, saying that, if this issue became public, and many people heard about it, then there was the high possibility that workers would not only be fired but would actually be deported. Without knowing the immigration of status of any workers, he made this comment, and I think it's interesting that the college tried so hard to frame this event as though they were protecting workers, although they ended up firing people who had devoted so much time to them over the last couple of decades in certain cases. Could you possibly speak to a couple of stories of your co-workers who were fired, especially the ones who have been a Pomona College for a long time?Christian Torres:	Yeah. There's a cook who've been there for 22 years, and she was very upset. She felt that the way the Pomona College treat us was very humiliated. Because of her 22 years hard working for Pomona, and that never happened before. She was very concerned, that why now? Why after so many years of my life given to the [00:25:00] Pomona College, why now? So many workers too, even worker who worked there for 20 years, and that is the only place where he work, Pomona College. He have never worked in another place, and for him, I think, is going to be very hard psychologically to pass this moment. Because it's very hard even for me of who I've been there for only seven years, I don't feel very comfortable right now because I don't know what to do. I know I had to find another job, but also I wanted to fight to protect my co-workers that never had this thing, it never happened before in Pomona.David Siew:	It seems like it's possible that the reason that the college was trying to frame this event as though they are protecting workers is because they wanted everyone to keep the event quiet, because they're worried about their reputation. Pomona College is right now ranked as the fourth best private college in the country. They have the largest endowment of any private college in the country, and they also have the rating as having the happiest students in the country. Currently Pomona College has an extremely good reputation on many fronts, but with an events such as this one, especially when they have a diversity policy that says that they promote all kinds of diversity, especially in relation to immigration status, it seems that the college was really trying to protect their reputation. One of the reasons that I came to Pomona College, and didn't go to somewhere such as Swarthmore, or Williams, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, was because Pomona College offers scholarships to so many students. Eighty percent of students at Pomona College are on scholarship, and the average scholarship is about $33,000, so that allows for a huge range of diversity in terms of economics, culture, race, immigration status, country of origin, religion, all sorts of people are there. As a Pomona College community, we hold a very high standard for diversity, and it's very important to us that everyone is respected, and everyone is accepted. I always felt that people were accepted. But after the last couple of weeks, I've felt like that's not necessarily true, and do you think that a lot of workers have felt like they're no longer accepted because of this?Christian Torres:	Yeah. They feel very bad about it. They feel discriminated, a lot of them feel that. Also, they feel the college is responding against the workers because the union drive. Because the worker decided to stand up and fight for the rights, and they felt like that what happens last week is because of that. They feel like that way, and so many workers get afraid. Some of them also, they still wanted to fight to get a better workplace.David Siew:	Could you tell the story of a couple of the workers who have been fired in the last couple of years who have been union leaders?Christian Torres:	Yeah. There were two workers. One of them, her name is Rosaura. She used to work for the dining halls as a cook, and also as a cashier, and she was one of the strongest leaders we have. She was in the negotiation committee for Worker for Justice, and she got injured at work. During she got injured, she got this pregnancy. She got pregnant. She had to get up for work more than a year and because of that then they fire her. She was about the strongest leader we have. Then there was another, also he was Rosaura's brother, Francisco, who also was a very strong leader [00:30:00] and also part of the negotiation committee. He got injured at work too, and because he presented this letter from the doctor three days late, and even though the certain doctor's secretary tell the Pomona College that it was her fault that Francisco got this letter late, even with that they fire him too. Now, we talk about it, they fire 17 more workers.David Siew:	Is it true that in the last couple of weeks they've been bringing people into the cafeteria and interviewing them while you guys are working?Christian Torres:	Yeah. I think that's are very rude move from the college especially from the management because that made the worker feel like they already know what they're going to do with us or they wanted to get rid of us and they're just preparing these guys to replace us.David Siew:	After seeing multiple union leaders get fired, is it true that at one when you were hoping for a promotion, a manager told you that you wouldn't get one until you took off the Workers for Justice button that I see where I now?Christian Torres:	I'm still wearing. Yeah, that happened. This manager came to me and because I applied for a promotion and I didn't get it, and this manager came to me and she told me that if I already have applied for this position and I told her yes. She said, ""Do know why they didn't give you or they're not going to give you this position?"" I said, ""I might know."" Yeah because of that, because I was wearing my button of Workers for Justice. She told me that you just take it off and you're going to get the position and now you're danger put it back.David Siew:	Because of what she said to you, you filed a complaint with NLRB.Christian Torres:	Yeah.David Siew:	Now the school is being prosecuted by the NLRB, and because they disagreed to settle. Knowing that the school wouldn't give you a promotion without you taking your Workers for Justice button off and knowing that multiple union leaders had been fired, what drives you to continue to stay in the fight?Christian Torres:	Because of what already happened to my coworkers and to me because the administration, so the managers, they are given the power from the administration. Even if I go to the President or I involve to HR or to wherever up there, they're not going to listen to the workers. They didn't listen to me. They didn't listen to my coworkers. One day when this new manager came and she approached me and she pulled me to his office and she started talking about the union, she said that her father used to work for unions and the union isn't what everybody say. With the union, you're not going to get a better raise or with the union you're not going to get a better healthcare or you can get fired even with the union and things like that. We delegated a person not to be me and five more coworkers. We told her that what the General Manager did, it wasn't what they agreed not to do. They made their investigation and that the result was I called for this meeting and the issue of the meeting was my discretion. I was like, are you serious? I mean, yeah. The Vice-President [inaudible 00:34:44] told me that that. Yeah, that's what the manager told us and you're going to have a little bit of writing and she said yeah. I know you're going to go late to your managers. You're not going to listen to your workers know and she did it.David Siew:	Yeah. It seems like [00:35:00] what the college continually does is they silence the workers. Now they've begun to try and silence the students and silence the faculty. The faculty proposed a resolution almost immediately after the letters were sent out because so many faculty members who had been at Pomona College for a long time were so insulted by what happened. For me, that was extremely important in knowing that there was a large amount of support from different factions of the community for pushing the college to not do what they did. For me, one of the things that catapulted me into the movement was I went to Maria, the woman who swipes me in to the cafeteria every morning, and I asked her if her job was in danger and she was so terrified about what was happening that she began to cry. She cried in my arms and in her last shift before workers were fired, she came out of the dining hall and said that her head hurt and then she had to go home and she was there crying and I was there crying with her.Knowing that the college is trying to silence students, some students have set up tents outside of the administration building at the college. There was a boycott at the college over the last three days where students were asked not to enter the dining halls. For the most part, students were in support of the workers and didn't enter the dining halls. Currently, of the two dining halls on Pomona College; the dining hall in South Campus where freshman and sophomores live is closed because there aren't enough people to run the dining hall after the 17 workers were fired. On Friday, myself and 14 people including; alumni, students, and some people from other unionization movements, decided that in order to show the college that they couldn't silence us, we would be arrested. We entered the dining hall on Friday morning and Christian approached Glenn, the General Manager, and told him that he was here to work. Glenn told him that he was no longer a member of the Pomona College community, that he no longer worked for Pomona College. We left the dining hall, most of us in tears, and walked down in front of the administration building. We sat in a circle on the street, blocking traffic and were arrested for unlawful assembly.What we're hoping is that the message will get out to the world, to the Los Angeles community, to the Claremont community about what's happened at Pomona College, about the injustice that's going on there, about the way that the college is treating workers like Christian, whose grown so much in terms of his personal growth, in terms of playing music, in terms of speaking English, in terms of having confidence in all realms of life. We want people to know that our community is not broken. Christian is still part of our community. We're still going to support him and we're still going to support his co-workers who have been fired. We're going do even more to support the workers who are still at Pomona College to show the college and to show the board whose on Wall Street right now that they can't break us apart because our bonds as people who see each other every day are far stronger than any legal issues that the college claims that there are. On a final note, the college never reported to the students what law legally obligates them to do what they do. Karen Chu sent someone to the college to tell them that they were in no way legally obligated to do what they did. The Scripps President, Scripps is one of the colleges within the five school consortium at Claremont, told the Pomona College that years ago when the same sort of thing happened at Scripps, as soon as it came to her desk, she immediately put the I-9 forms into deep storage and workers were not fired there. The college really didn't have to do what it did. It was totally an internal decision, and now Christian has no job.Christian Torres:	Yeah I know listening to that, I'd like everybody to know that workers have rights, and one of the rights is to fight for a better workplace and those right's have to be respected. That's why the Pomona College dining hall workers [00:40:00] are fighting for to get a better workplace, their voices to be heard, to have protection, and they have to respect that too, and they're not doing it.David Siew:	As this community, as students, as workers, as alumni, we will come together and we'll continue to ask the college to respect us. We'll continue to ask the college to respect us as individuals and as a community. We won't stop until the college decides that it does respect its community.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
mby008714,"CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	[00:00:00] Good morning. Hi. My name is Claudia Sandoval. I'm 23 years old and today's date is December 11th, 2011. We are here in Los Angeles, California and my relationship to Mari Riddle is that we're work colleagues, and I'm also placed at Centro Latino for Literacy as an AmeriCorps member.MARI RIDDLE:	My name is Mari Riddle. I'm 55 years old. Today's date is December 11th, 2011 and our location is Los Angeles, California. My relationship to Claudia Sandoval is that I work with her at Centro Latino for Literacy where I'm the president and CEO.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Great. Mari, just to start off and introduce yourself a little bit more, where did you grow up?MARI RIDDLE:	I was born in Eagle Pass, Texas, and that's a border town with Mexico. The sister city is Piedras Negras, Coahuila. That's where I grew up for the first 17 years of my life. All my family, all my siblings were born there. We lived in the same house, which I think is rare sometimes these days, but that's where I grew up. It was a small border town and it was the county seat of Maverick County.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Cool. Can you name one or two items that you think were unique to where you grow up?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, I can name a couple of more than one or two, but I think what was really exciting about being raised on a border is that our downtown is connected by a bridge that was maybe an eighth of a mile, if that, and so there was a lot of fluidity back and forth. We really lived in a bicultural, bilingual. Most of the people that lived in Eagle Pass spoke Spanish as their first language, and about, I would say, a good 95 percent of the people that lived in Eagle Pass were Mexicanos, either being born in Mexico or first-generation, second-generation born in Eagle Pass. MARI RIDDLE:	But the unique thing was that you could tell who the Anglos were that were not born in Eagle Pass. Because most of the people that were not Mexicanos and were Anglo actually spoke Spanish, understood Spanish and they saw it as a very important element if they were doctors, lawyers, if they owned retail businesses, all of these things. So this whole idea of bicultural economies and binational economies, it was something we grew up with and it's not like that anymore, unfortunately. But it was a true bicultural, binationalism, which I really enjoyed. The one thing that's really interesting is that one of our hometown musicians named Gary Hobbs, he's Anglo, as Anglo as they come, but he's one of the big Tejano singers. They call him El Borrado, and he's got a great following, and he's from Eagle Pass.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Wow, that's very interesting.MARI RIDDLE:	It's really unique place to be from.FEMALE_1:	When were you aware of that bicultural environment that you were living in? As a child, when did you realize?MARI RIDDLE:	My mother would pick us, would take all of us, I'm one of five. So we went to my grandmother's and we spent all our summers at my grandmother's in Northern Mexico. So I was very aware that how -- My cousins lived on the other side and this was about four to five hours in the interior. My mother's from a small town in Mexico called Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila. We would spend two and half months there every summer. I saw how different it was because of the way my cousins were going to school. When they went to school in public school in Mexico, they took a lot more courses than we did. They were taking Latin, they were taking philosophy, they were taking all of these courses that we never had in Texas. MARI RIDDLE:	So, I started realizing that there was some real difference, but at the same time, there was a unique relationship. The other part of when I started learning a little bit more about the differences too, was that my mother would send us to shop on the Mexican side. We [00:05:00] would have grocery lists; we would have the Texas side of our grocery list and we'd have the Mexican side of our grocery list. So most of our vegetables and our brown sugar and all of these things were in the mercado, all in pesos, so I knew how to do the currency exchange. We'd just come across the border and then say what we had, and then we'd continue our shopping on the Eagle Pass side. I think as a young kid growing up when I started comparing notes with my cousins, and then against just doing the regular shopping for my mom, I realized there was a difference, but at the same time it worked.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	What did your parents do?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, my dad was a principal in an elementary school. Prior to that, he was a high school teacher, he's taught American history and government. But interestingly enough, he didn't go to get his masters in education until he started falling in love with my mother, or just before that, I think, when he realized, maybe I need to go to school. But for a long time he worked in the hotel industry. He worked in what is now the Sheraton Gunter in San Antonio, Texas. But he was the concierge or the hotel manager or things like that. He worked in New Orleans and worked in different places in Texas. But then he decided to settle down and go to school and get a masters, and decided education would be what he wanted to do. He taught high school, government and history, and then from there went and got his education administration degree and became an elementary school teacher, excuse me, principal and a junior high principal. But one of the things he also did was that he taught adult basic ed, GED, in the evenings. He also was a bookkeeper for the local retail store, one of the big stores in Eagle Pass. Even though he had a degree and all that stuff, Texas is a right to work state, so a lot of the salaries were quite low, even for teachers and administrators, so he always had to moonlight other jobs in order to make ends meet, and that's what he did. But he loved teaching and he really enjoyed teaching adults. He just thought that, here they are working all long days and they'd go to school and go for it, so he really admired that.MARI RIDDLE:	My mom got as far as comercio in Mexico, which is she finished her sixth grade and then she was sent to a boarding school because in this little town, you could only go as far as sixth grade. She was sent to a religious school, internada, she was boarding school con las monjas, with the nuns. She and her sister ended up going together and they got through just a little short of high school; in Mexico it's preparatoria. Then she was a secretary and then she met my dad and she came over when she got married. She became a housewife, but she decided to get her GED as well. So she went to school and she learned English, and my dad actually taught her, and she got her high school GED. But my mom was those kind of people that she didn't mind if English was a barrier. She really got to it and she learned it, and she became a substitute teacher. She substitute taught in high school, in junior high, and she insisted on speaking English no matter how difficult it was for her. But she would do everything in English and she was a model. I was always embarrassed when she was a substitute teacher in my classroom, because I was so embarrassed, but I have to give her a lot of credit because she really did it. She did a lot of odd stuff, she was the tamale maker for Eagle Pass. She had made great tamales, so she did everything she needed to do to also help out.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Yes. Definitely.FEMALE_1:	For the record, what are your parents names.MARI RIDDLE:	Of course, my mother's name is Elvira; Ferriño is her last name Riddle. Elvira Ferriño Riddle, and my father's name [00:10:00] was Octavio Rodolfo Riddle, and they're both Mexican. My mother's background is Italian, Spanish, and Mexican, and my father's background is Irish, which is where the Riddle comes from, Irish and Mexican.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	What kind of influences do you think they had or have on you now?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, I think they really stressed education as a way to get ahead. I think they were pretty much middle-class and my father realized that he couldn't give us a lot. But if he could get us to go to school and really pay attention and he really said, ""Don't ever settle for a bachelors. You have to get your masters,"" which is very unique, I think. My mother was like,  ""Aye! Para que? What for? Really, why do you have to study so much?"" It's like maybe, ""I'd love for you to get married and have family and have kids so you have a masters and you're a housewife.""MARI RIDDLE:	So, there was a little tension back and forth there, but I think all of us followed that. Many of us got our masters of my siblings. So, it was really a critical point of really striving to go far and look at the pathway of success as an educator or working in education. The other person that was really instrumental in my life was actually my father's sister. I'm her namesake. Her name is Maria Isabel, which is my name, Maria Isabel, but I go by Mari. She was a teacher and she was a musician, so she taught us piano. But she was really somebody that defied a lot of odds. She got her master's in the late '30s and her and my dad because of the last name Riddle, it's really interesting, but they were raised in a border town in Mexico. Because their last name was Riddle, they were able to go to public school. They were raised at a time when Mexicans were not allowed to go to school and a lot of different things, but their last name allowed them to access public education. But they were Mexicanos.MARI RIDDLE:	It's a really interesting thing of like, census and last name and what does that mean? But they were given a lot of opportunities. My aunt was the first woman, the first Mexicana, that introduced Spanish into the Eagle Pass school system. She really focused on trying to bring it into the school system. She was the first teacher. She also introduced French into the high school. She realized that it needed to be taught. So she went, and she learned French, and she came back and she introduced it. There's a lot that they provided to that town as far as educational legacies.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Wow.MARI RIDDLE:	I guess it's in my genes. None of us really ever went to school for education, but I think we know how important it is. Now I'm here at Centro Latino, focusing on literacy. It's a nice full circle, I think.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Definitely. Sounds amazing. What is one experience you remember that you can tell us about?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, again, I go back to I guess two things, high school and this again, to my dad's tenacity. But my father realized that he really wanted us to travel. So he learned about Rotary International, and he became a Rotarian and he took it upon himself to host international student conferences in Eagle Pass. This was in my high school time. So what we would do, it was a three-day conference, and we would bring students from Mexico at least about a good, if you think about, 250 to 300 miles south of high school students south of the border, and then high school students north of the border, about the same. We bring all of these students together, including the exchange students that happened to be in Texas or in Mexico through Rotary. We call this the International Student Conference. My dad would help organize it.MARI RIDDLE:	In these international student conferences, we would develop the questions or the issues, and we would be debating issues that were global and also issues that had to do with both sides of the border. During that time, the [00:15:00] students that were bilingual, our role was not only to participate, but we were the simultaneous translators. During high school, I learned and started understanding the importance of language and communication and translation. We would have, I would say, about 200 to 250 students. At the time, the students that were visiting from other countries would come, so there were students from South Africa, students from Brazil, students from a number of different places. It was really a very interesting international student conference. It took place over three years of my high school. It really opened my eyes to the importance of communication and respect. One of the things we would always hold up was the saying Benito Juarez, who was a Mexican president, the first indigenous Mexicano president, I think in the Americas before Evo Morales but it was 1860s. He said, ""Al derecho ajeno es la paz."" Respect to others, or to the foreign, is peace. We would start out with that.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Wow, that's amazing. So from the sounds of it, and since you grew up with education really playing a role in your life, I must ask, did you like school then?MARI RIDDLE:	I really liked school. The part of school I didn't like was the part of school that's like, ""I don't fit in and this and that. I am not popular and all that."" Those were the angsts that happened a lot. But the other important thing for me in high school especially was I came across a teacher that just changed my life. He was a teacher from California actually, and he was a drama teacher. He came with the whole concept of Teatro de la Esperanza, Teatro Campesino. At that time, it was very radical. Chicano Theater, coming to the border town in Eagle Pass. Well, my father was very conservative and I come from a pretty conservative family, even though education was key. As far as socially and politically, it was very conservative. So it was really interesting to see the dynamic between my father finally respecting Jesse Velez, which is what the drama teacher's name was, and what he did for the students. My dad sort aside, ""Okay, he's actually not all radical."" I'm thinking, ""But look at what he's doing with his students.""CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Exactly.MARI RIDDLE:	Mr. Velez really helped shape the drama department. Through his coaching and everything, we became a pretty good drama team at the high school and competed in regional and district competitions. We mounted 13 plays in one year, including a musical. This was all because the teacher believed in us. Again, it's like, ""We can do it. We can build the props. We can do this. We can do that."" We said, "" Okay, sure. Let's do it."" So I spent hours and hours and hours at the high school, learning lines, being in drama, doing this. Then when we were juniors, our last school project was we had to direct a play and we had to put it on. So I directed Dial M for Murder. My audience was the junior high students. It's hard to keep junior high students. Engrossed. But it was wonderful because it was a high school production for the junior high, and I was just introduced to a whole new world. Jesse Velez was the person who told me, ""You don't have to stay in Texas, you can leave the state."" He spoke to my dad and I ended up leaving the state to go out to the East Coast to study. It was really a wonderful opening of the doors.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	That's amazing. Sounds great. So Mari, what do you do?MARI RIDDLE:	I am the most proud and happy President and CEO of a wonderful organization called Centro Latino for Literacy. Centro Latino is a non-profit that was established 20 years ago by an emigrant, Marcos Cajina, who participated in his native Nicaragua's literacy campaigns. When he came to Los Angeles, he recognized the issue of illiteracy among Latino immigrants and thought, ""Well, why don't we [00:20:00] start something here."" So from tutoring one-on-one, to church basements, to classrooms, to working with AmeriCorps and VISTA volunteers, 20 years later, Centro Latino occupies a full city block in West Lake Pico-Union, and very highly dense Latino neighborhood. A lot of the people migrating into Pico-Union and West Lake area came from Central America during the 1980s.MARI RIDDLE:	So what we do there is we teach people who were never able to go to school how to read and write. Both Marcos and then Melanie, my predecessor, Melanie Stevens, they developed a classroom program called Leamos. Leamos is a web-based curriculum. They took what they designed in the classroom and tested and put it online, so that, as we speak right now, anybody that is Spanish-speaking that was never able to go to school maybe past the second grade, they can contact us and we can link them up to their own account. They can learn how to read and write on the computer through Leamos, with the help of a tutor or a friend. That could be a family member, that could be someone that they work with. We had a person who's niece and landlord got together to help him learn how to read and write through Leamos. So, I've been heading up this organization since March of 2010, and our goal is to make all the learning that we do in the classroom, to put it on the web so that people can learn how to read, write, add, subtract, multiply, divide, and get over their fear of technology, all by the Internet.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Definitely. I can vouch to that as well since I tutor some of the students. How did you get involved with Centro Latino for Literacy?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, they were very well known in Los Angeles as an organization that was unique and working through popular education, too which is, of course, the whole methodology or the pedagogy of Paulo Freire from Brazil, who wrote ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed."" The whole technique about popular education is, really, you see an individual as what they bring to the table. It's not what they're lacking, but what they have. So in a sense, the idea is to meet them at their level and not talk down to them, not be dogmatic, but really meet everybody at their own level and then based on where they're at accessing education, so that you make education relevant to their lives. That's the methodology that we work with in Centro Latino. Centro Latino was one of a number of organizations in Los Angeles that was working on literacy. So, I knew Marcos, I knew Melanie because I also did a lot of work and a lot of volunteer work in the Central American community. So, it was not -- You know, it was natural for us to run into each other, and so I knew and had followed Centro Latino. When Melanie, who was the previous Executive Director, decided to step down and they opened up the position, I saw that it was available, and I threw my head in the ring, and they decided I was the one.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	That's great.MARI RIDDLE:	So, that's how I knew about Centro Latino. I knew of their work.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Wonderful. You already stated that they work with the Pico-Union. So, what has been your proudest moment at Centro Latino for Literacy?MARI RIDDLE:	I think a couple, maybe two or three things. One is, there's moments when students validate what you do, and that happens on a regular basis. I think those are proud moments for all of us because it's as if a light turns on. It's as if people who have been kept isolated because, through no fault of their own, recognize that it's not their fault. What we need to do is shed and get away from the stigma of illiteracy, both individually, but as a society that blames [00:25:00] the person for being non-literate. So moments, to me, are like the ""aha"" moment for me. I come from the field of community economic development, and for me to realize how prevalent the issue is; in LA County alone, there's close to 216,000 Latino Spanish-speaking adults who are non-literate in either English or Spanish, or there's over two million in the United States. But we're part of the 30 million in the United States that are non-literate in English, enough to be able to write, to fill out a job application or read the newspaper; they're functionally illiterate.MARI RIDDLE:	So, we have a great obligation, not only to Latinos, but to our society in general, to actually open the door and make literacy accessible to people. So those are the small, little triumphs, but then what I did in early this year was that I brought the issue of illiteracy or non-literacy to an open forum. It was at the Federal Reserve. There was a record attendance, and the subject was adult literacy, the practical solutions. I teamed up with Cathay Reta, who heads up ProLiteracy California. So we did a really wonderful 45-minute presentation about the issue of illiteracy and how it's affecting the economics, health, incarceration rates, everything across the board. So many people in the audience, which included a lot of bankers, but a lot of non-profits and some funders, were like, ""I had no idea."" From that, she and I co-wrote an article that was just published in the fall Journal of Community Investments, which is called ""Adult Transformation Through Literacy."" That is distributed to a regional market, which includes Alaska, Hawaii, and a lot of the Western states. MARI RIDDLE:	So those are the ""aha"" moments. Those are the most proud because I think, oftentimes, as a society, we don't think about this. We either delegate it or relegate it to the libraries or the education world, which is wonderful, but we need to infuse it into our everyday life because it hits every single aspect of society, including civic engagement at every level. I'm not talking about voting, although, that's important, I'm talking about a person's ability to take part in their neighborhood council or be vocal in their PTA. That level of civic engagement is missing when people are not literate.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Okay. How different do you think adult literacy is now from when you were growing up, or what has changed or stayed the same?MARI RIDDLE:	I think, unfortunately, what has changed is that there's less funding behind adult literacy. When I was growing up, I wasn't as aware of the issue. Although I will say, when I think about it, I realize there are a lot of people surrounding my family, not necessarily immediate family members, but people that were clearly around our family that were non-literate and that just made way, made do. Again, I grew up in a border town and I spent a lot of my summers in Mexico. It was a rural and agricultural community, so a lot of people that worked in the fields and people that worked in a lot of these different places didn't have the education. There were a lot of a [inaudible 00:29:11] . So many people had only gotten to a certain grade level. But I also think that what changed from the literacy network days and the interest in it is that much of the funding for adult education is really decimated. It doesn't get the importance that it needs, and I think a lot of different resources are trying to go after a very shrinking pie, but we really need to be very forthright in saying that if parents aren't educated, if parents don't know how to read and write, how do you have children [00:30:00] really fully engaged in school?CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Exactly. What is the importance of being literate as an adult? Like you said, it's important they play a role in the children's life, but how else does it play a role in everyday life?MARI RIDDLE:	Well, just think about it, your everyday life, what you did this morning, what we're going to do today, how much involves print? How much involves the written word? How much involves writing? Now, clearly, we have computers now and we have all these different things, but can you really go through your day without reading or writing or even doing math computation? If you go to the bank. So literacy affects everyday life. That's why our vision in Centro Latino is that every non-literate Spanish-speaking adult in the US have an opportunity to be literate, functionally literate, achieve functional literacy.MARI RIDDLE:	So, I keep telling people that if you want an engaged society, you have to have literate individuals. People will say, ""Information is knowledge."" You know, in order to have a democracy, you need information. You need to have access to information. Well, I go the step removed and say, ""In order to be engaged in a society, you need to be literate."" It really, really focuses on the literate individual.MARI RIDDLE:	So, my hats off and mi respetos to so many of our adult learners, Spanish-speaking as well as English-speaking, because they navigate this world being functionally illiterate. They navigate this world having maybe some semblance of literacy. There are a lot more out there than we think. The ability to, again, through the Freire method which is like, look at where they're coming from and what they bring to the table, and then the ability to be literate. It's mind-blowing because they are already accommodating. They're already able to navigate this society. It can only make them that much more participatory.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Yes, definitely. How do you think we can play a role in positively changing people's perception of adult literacy?MARI RIDDLE:	Ways like StoryCorps. Again, it's really about people's stories. It's a two-level approach. You can do the research approach and you can do all of these statistics and you can say, ""The number one cost of health care is illiteracy."" There's so much wasted resources in health care based on people's inability to read their prescriptions, to understand when their next appointment is. For me, my background is an urban planner. I have a masters in urban planning and with a focus on economic development. I keep saying, if we were to have everybody be literate and know how to read, write, add, subtract, and compute, we would save a lot of money, because the intersection of incarceration rates and illiteracy are very, very high. The intersection of health costs and illiteracy are extremely high.MARI RIDDLE:	So, let's go back to the basics and figure out what we can do to take care of this. So, I just think the other importance is many decision-makers and many people, the movers and shakers sometimes don't get the issue because they've never seen it in their lifetime. But the more that we tell stories, the more that we're unafraid of coming forward and saying, ""This was my dad, this was my mother, this was me,"" people will recognize and say, ""Oh my goodness."" It is more prevalent and it's nothing to be ashamed of. We can all go forward and be able to become more literate. Literacy opens the door to the amazing literature that's out there to all of these different things. It's just the -- [00:35:00] Abre la puerta . That's what people say. People in our program say, ""I was blind, but now I see."" It's not to discount people that are truly physically bind, but to a person that is non-literate, it's, they're in a cloud. They've been isolated. They're in this cage. They're in this thing that they've been able to function in. You start opening that door, you start taking off the blinders, and it's transformative.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Great. Yeah, I definitely agree. How grateful are you for being able to pursue your education and now be able to reciprocate what your parents and teachers did for you?MARI RIDDLE:	I'm very grateful. It was what opened the doors. It was what got me scholarships. It's what took me to places that I would have never been.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Great. Is there anything else you would like to add that maybe I didn't address or you didn't address? Any final words?MARI RIDDLE:	I think I'm a learner in this too. I'm just really understanding the level and the issue of non-literacy in our community, in our society. I would invite people to look at adult literacy. We're all focused on children's literacy, which is wonderful. But let's focus with the parents and adults, and check out your local library, check out your local adult education program. Anybody hearing this, see how you can volunteer and change a person's life by being a tutor.CLAUDIA SANDOVAL:	Well, thank you so much, Mari, for answering my question.MARI RIDDLE:	You're welcome. This was great.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Daniel, talking about the arts and community activism, give us some of the things that you've started off. I know you're a performer, you're an artist, you're community organizing. Maybe just tell us your background, your story.DANIEL LLANES:	Well, I was born in San Antonio, Texas. I'm a native Texan, and I grew up there and in East LA. Growing up, I was raised by my grandparents, and my mom was one of eight kids. My grandmother, half of her family was in California and half in Texas. Since I was raised by my grandparents, they moved around, so I moved around with them. I partially grew up in San Antonio and partially in LA.DANIEL LLANES:	When I was going through school, my biggest interests were really history and art, and I became an artist. One of the motivating factors of becoming an artist was when I was in sociology class and they were explaining the different professions that people do, the artist was the only one that was not in a class, like working-class, middle-class, wealthy, et cetera. The artist moved in all of society, and that really attracted me. I didn't really have any idea why except that in school, art class was my thing that I look forward to and everything else was boring. Then when I went to college, I did the standard stuff in the first semester, and then I dropped out before I finished the year. Then the following year, I went back to school and just studied art classes. DANIEL LLANES:	My biggest interest was, of course, music, but I studied all the various arts, but dance really became captivating to me. Primarily, because I had a lot of energy and it was the one thing that would exhaust me. A lot of things I could do and I'd get tired, but you wouldn't get that satisfied. Anyway, it was very physical and very disciplined, and so I've been dancing for 35 years. I still dance, not as much as I did in my 20s to 40s or 45, but the last few years, I still do dance. But anyway, as an artist, I met my wife. We got married and we had my beautiful daughter, Carmen. She has two daughters, my stepdaughter, Memos, and Juniper, are Carmen's older sisters.DANIEL LLANES:	I moved to Austin. I followed a girl to Austin in like '70, '71. Then was in and out of Austin until I got a job here. I actually was in New York City studying dance. Then someone from Texas called me, Dee McCandless, who -- I knew her boyfriend. She had gotten the first National Endowment Grant given to a dancer in Texas.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Wow.DANIEL LLANES:	She asked me if I would be part of her production. They got me a job with Laguna Gloria Art Museum. Because I told myself, ""Well, I can't go down there,"" because it was like three months or something like that. But that caused me to come back to Austin, and having a regular job or having a job on a regular basis allowed me to stay in Austin. When I was younger, I worked in restaurants, stuff like that while I studied art and dance. I used to live in Austin and go to San Marcos to school there. Then I met my first dance company when I was still in San Antonio. They were based in Denton at North Texas State, which is the University of Texas Fine Arts School. I went there and [00:05:00] I auditioned for the company. I didn't make it, but they took me on as an apprentice, and that connected me to New York, and then eventually, I went there, but I was pulled back to Texas.DANIEL LLANES:	New York was exciting, but I didn't like living there. I was a Texas boy. I love sky and grass and all that stuff. Hijo. Also, Texas is friendly, New York was not very friendly. Nearly Denton, but Austin is. Then I lived and worked here. Then like I say, I was one of the first wave of people who established as dancers in Austin in the late '70s through the late '80s. Dance was big. As a matter of fact, during the late '70s and early '80s, Austin was number 3 in dance in the world after New York and Paris. There was a lot of activity. That's why I was here. That's why I could be here because there was action and funding.DANIEL LLANES:	The first time that I went for public money as an artist, that was the first time I hit upon real obvious racism. As an adult, I started to understand about racism, but that was my really first bang. I want to say that when I was in the second grade as a Latino, I was born in San Antonio to a working class Mexican-American family. When I was in the second grade, well, I didn't know English until I went to school to the first grade. In the second grade, I observed that children who spokes English with Spanish accent were treated terribly. But if you didn't have an accent, people treated you differently. At seven years old, without even knowing, just reacting, I decided that I was going to learn English and Spanish perfectly. Throughout my life that I have seen that as a constant. I mean, I saw it in high school, I see even today how differently people treat people.FEMALE_1:	I'm sorry.DANIEL LLANES:	Go ahead.FEMALE_1:	Lets talk about, you mentioned that as an adult, you first experienced firsthand discrimination racism when you went for public money?DANIEL LLANES:	For money.FEMALE_1:	What does that mean?DANIEL LLANES:	Well, that means that I was in a studio. I helped start the dance umbrella in Austin in 1978, I believe, in '77. It was started to help individual dance artists in Austin with funding because Austin was one of the few cities in those times that funded dance. It was because the dance community had gotten so strong. I worked in one of the most successful studios at that time, was Studio D on 6th Street. Before 6th Street, just to give you an idea, Scotty's BBQ and the Green Spot were there.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yeah. I remember those spots. Really good.DANIEL LLANES:	That's where it was basically blues at Scotty's, black blues at Scotty's, like the Victory Grill. Then Conjunto at the Green Spot. Then we had this dance studio, modern dance, it's also in Texas. There was another one down the street. But getting back to your question about racism, I was in the studio that was like a hotbed of the arts and in dance, and I'll tell you that we were number 3 in the world at that time. As an artist, I also taught and there were nine artists in that studio. I was the only one from Texas and the only one from Austin. Once arts funding in Texas started, here came all the New Yorkers; Yacov Sharir came from Israel and set up his dance company. Michael Sokoloff came from San Francisco and set up a dance company. DANIEL LLANES:	There were a core of us here in Austin who had helped create this scene that now is getting funded. While I was one in nine artists and shortly after arts funding started in Austin and they started funding dance, my classes were supporting this studio. Very few of the artists were bringing in money, but those other artists were able to do stuff and I never knew how. Then finally, I asked somebody and they just off the top and said, ""Well, I mean, we just applied for the grant and got it."" ""How do you do that?"" Nobody would ever tell me how to do it. Then when I met Charlotte, my wife, who's white, and well-off, [00:10:00] and connected, she knew about arts funding, and so we applied together as artists.DANIEL LLANES:	Even when I got funded as an artist, city staff would tell me, ""Well, you can't pay yourself. You can pay everybody else, but you can't pay yourself."" I said, ""Well, why is that?"" I said, ""I know Heloise Gold and Deborah Hay, and they've gotten $5,000 to $8,000 and they don't pay anybody, they pay themselves, and they do their own thing."" I said, ""Me as a producer, I pay the light man, I pay the janitor, I pay all the artists, why can I not pay me?"" I challenged it. The staff person actually lied to me. He said, ""Well, it's policy."" I said, ""Show it to me."" He took me around for six weeks and never showed it to me. Finally, he had to concede there was no policy. That to me was like, ""Wait a minute, I'm sitting in the studio, I'm the only non-white person, I'm supporting everybody, everybody else is getting funded and nobody wants to let me into the funding cycle."" Once I get in the funding cycle, then city staff tries to dumb me down, push me down. Of course, I resisted.SUSANA ALMANZA:	I do remember one time you organizing when all the Latino artists were not getting their share or percentage.DANIEL LLANES:	That actually was a byproduct, Susana. That was like a cultural bias thing, but it's primarily like racism, I think is secondary to classism. It was like arts funding at that point got to a point where they had the five major organizations: the ballet, the symphony, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The Theatre of Zachary Scott, Laguna Gloria, who's now the Austin Museum of Art, they changed their name after this, because we shamed them. They tried to create a private partnership with the city to create a city museum, but it was all crooked politics, real crooked politics.DANIEL LLANES:	What happened was that someone came to me, an artist that I know, and there had been a group of artists had gotten together, 50 artists as a matter of fact. Some of them were part of those organizations, but as individual artists, we challenged the notion of giving one entity control over city public money. Laguna Gloria wanted to become like the Arts Commission and they wanted to dole out money. We sued the city. That busted up the monopoly that these five organizations had, because they knew how to work the system and so just like the Latino community and just like the African-American community, the artist community, just as artists, we learned how it works. You know what? We sued the city over this contract with Laguna Gloria that was going to give them control over all the public arts money in the city, and it's illegal but they're going to do it. Anyway, until we went turned on the light. DANIEL LLANES:	Then it all folded. Laguna Gloria got a big payoff so that they wouldn't countersue. The director of Laguna Gloria was dismissed and they rewarded him by putting him on the Texas Commission of the Arts, that's Laurence Miller. This is what I learned as a human being in Texas, in my profession as an artist, when it came time to money, and contracts, and who gets paid, and who doesn't. That was my first real hit on experience with racism. Then when I would look back when I was a kid, when I was in high school and in junior high school, I looked back and saw, like I remember in high school, I always used to get in trouble for how I dressed and how I had long hair and stuff. It was the late '60s, '68, '69. I would get in trouble and the coaches would say, ""Why don't you just quit school? Just quit. You don't like it here, just quit."" They were encouraging people to drop out. That's how lame -- And so when that was happening, it made me feel awful, but I was just a naive kid. But when I look back, I go, ""Man, a lot was going on there."" So, then that leads me to say how protected I was by my family and by our community. I remember being five years old at a Fiesta. You know how they had Fiesta in San Antonio?SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yes.DANIEL LLANES:	[00:15:00] Five years old with my grandmother at the carnival and she was going to buy me a cowboy hat. We walked up there and she said, ""Which one do you want, mijo? Cual quieres?"" I pointed to one, and of course, I touched it, and the guy grabbed me, and pulled me up.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Oh, my goodness.DANIEL LLANES:	Yeah, and my grandmother just went, she had an umbrella, she just started beating him. Immediately, like four, five men hombres came and grabbed this guy, and he was a gringo and he said, ""This kid was trying to steal my -- "" They just pushed him back. It was like only now am I thinking because I said how protected I was. Same thing in high school. You talk about racism. When I was in junior high school, there were these big white guys that every day they would trip me in the hall. See, like I told you, I had lived in California. When I was a teenager in California in junior high school and then I moved back to Texas. I had long hair, I would wear beatle boots, that kind of stuff, didn't know anything about that here. These guys would harass me every day, they'd trip me and stuff. Then one day, I just had it. When this one got tripped me, I turned around and I just grabbed him by the throat. Of course, I was like this, he was a foot taller that me. So he pushed me and I heard (imitates hissing) like that. It was my head hitting the wall.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Oh, wow.DANIEL LLANES:	In that instant, like five or six Chicanos just jumped in, and beat the living shit out of him, and then stood around him and told everybody in the crowd, ""Don't you ever touch another one of my brothers again. "" I didn't know these guys from Adam. I didn't know them at all, but they were Mexicanos. I didn't hang around Mexicanos because I was always the new kid. I never even talked to them, I never even saw them again. They came to my rescue and then they disappeared. Of course, here comes a principle and we get in trouble and, ""Who started?"" All that kind of stuff.FEMALE_1:	I'm curious to know that who in your life had been that mentor? Or maybe that teacher that you looked up into? Or somehow you [crosstalk 00:17:25].DANIEL LLANES:	I will right away tell you that my grandparents were tremendous force in my life. They were people of such integrity and refinement. They were both cross a river when there were 13, 14 years old to escape the Mexican Revolution in 1910. So by the time I came along, they were pretty well established in San Antonio. My grandfather had worked at a fish factory, not factory, but they receive fish from the coast everyday.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yeah, the port.DANIEL LLANES:	Then he retired and then he did like yard work just 'cause he wanted something to do. He had his yard so nice that his neighbors started asking him, ""Will you do my yard, Don Ramon?"" So pretty soon we had-SUSANA ALMANZA:	A little business.DANIEL LLANES:	-a little business without even trying to come and get it, and everything. His boss actually let him work another 10 years. He worked till he was 75 for this guy, they loved him. My grandmother was just so loving and really good to me. She talked to me all the time, we're like friends. I started doing art when I was about eight or nine years old. They encouraged me, like the first time that I ever did something, they went, ""De donde sacas estas cosas?"" Like, ""Where did you get that?"" They were impressed. They always encouraged me and they always admired what I did. Like I said, they were very, very well-liked by people and were well-respected. Now, I know why because they were such good people and very reliable.FEMALE_1:	Did you as a kid always know you were going to be an artist? Was that always?DANIEL LLANES:	As a kid, no. When I was in high school, that's when I decided like I said in sociology class, and you're going through all the different professions, and well, you want to go into business, you want to become a doctor, you want to start your own business, do this than the other. But the thing that was weird to me was you studied Indian culture, and the cast system, and then we study American culture, and they'd say, ""We don't have a cast system."" But then they talk about working [00:20:00] class, middle class, upper middle class, wealthy, and then the establishment. FEMALE_1:	When do you think you gained maybe a political or a social consciousness? DANIEL LLANES:	Well, let's see. A social consciousness, I think that -- I never studied music. I'm a naive artist in music, but I did study dance, and dance forms, and many dance forms. Through that study, that's the study of culture. Really it's almost like there's one dance and then everybody interprets it their own way. So that's what the flavor of culture. That gave me an understanding of human nature, and I love mythology, and history, and all of that. So, that gave me an understanding about things. Then as far as politics, what I told you about my interaction in the arts, that I was not acting politically, I was acting out of economics. Because there was public funding, and somebody was trying to monopolize that. So I helped with other people to open that up. Because they used to give three, four, five percent to non-white organizations. Then after that, it was like there would not be La Peña, there would not be Mexic-Arte. There probably wouldn't be the MACC.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Right.DANIEL LLANES:	We waited 33 years for the MACC.SUSANA ALMANZA:	That's the Mexican American Culture Center here in Austin.DANIEL LLANES:	Right.FEMALE_1:	It sounds very exciting doing a career as a dancer, as an artist. What does that look like on a day-to-day, on a week-to-week, or even the changes from year to year? Can you just describe it?DANIEL LLANES:	Well, from year-to-year, like I said, I'm 62 now. I've been dancing since I was 18. I danced a lot until I was about 45. What I would do day-to-day then and now is very different.FEMALE_1:	What's been the most exciting in any aspect?DANIEL LLANES:	Exciting?FEMALE_1:	Yeah.DANIEL LLANES:	Oh, my lord. I love to dance. I love to play music. I mean, that's exciting, that's what gives me life. You know what's the most rewarding thing for me? Is that my daughter sings and dances with me. I can tell you every time we've gone on the stage together, that sends something, a message to people because people always come up, ""I love seeing a father and a daughter."" She grew up with it because her mother, who actually changed careers during the middle of our marriage, she also is an artist still, but she became a nutritionist and a scientist. She went back to graduate school and got a doctorate in nutrition. So, Carmen grew up, our kids grew up with the arts. But just to finish on the political thing, they had the politics there. At the same time or shortly after that, a guy knocked on my door, when I lived in Old West Austin on Highland in Clarksville, guy knocks on my door and he says, ""Hi, I'm from the neighborhood association."" I said, ""Oh, what's up?"" I had no idea. He said, ""Well, I'm just knocking on people's door. Did you know that somebody wants to build a five-story condo building behind your house?""SUSANA ALMANZA:	Wow.DANIEL LLANES:	I said, ""No."" That started my whole thing that I'm here with Susana today. I got involved in my neighborhood association because there's houses all around there, and this guy wanted to put a building. So, that started -- I thought, ""Well, I can't do anything about the world, but I can do things at arm's length."" I took seriously the idea of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, et cetera, et cetera. I wrote a few letters to the editor on things, and I helped build a few projects, and pretty soon other people were saying, ""Hey."" Then they asked me to join the neighborhood association. When I joined the neighborhood association that's when Austin Plan started.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Oh, yes. The Austin Plan.DANIEL LLANES:	I became the representative from Old West Austin Neighborhood Association to the Austin Plan with 100 other people from around the city. I was the only artist on that group.FEMALE_1:	Austin Plan?DANIEL LLANES:	The Austin Plan [00:25:00] was the second planning process that the City of Austin attempted. We're on our fourth.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Right. I think that takes us back, and I know you're talking about then coming, like when we got together, I know there's a lot of our history and dance side to part of that, but also, getting together because of where your studio and your home was along the river.DANIEL LLANES:	That's exactly right. When you talk about then, so I started out with my neighborhood association. Somehow I got on the Austin Plan thing doing the comprehensive plan for our part of the city. Then because of those activities, a friend of mine who I'd met through someone else, she was with the Austin Peace and Justice Coalition, and they wanted to get a more local plugin. So she invited me to be part of it, the APJC. I just asked a couple of simple questions. The thing is that they were supposed to have a board of 11, and that had dwindled down to five. It was one woman and four men. She was overpowered, and they would never let her talk and stuff, and so she brought me in. So to make a long story short, I became the chair of that organization and was probably that for about five years. During that time was when the SOS thing was happening and PODER was happening. Then that's how Susana and I reconnected.FEMALE_1:	Not to get too in detail of all of those organizations, but if you can just say what the Peace and Justice is, SOS, and PODER just quickly.DANIEL LLANES:	The Austin Peace and Justice Coalition was a coalition of local chapters, state, national, and international chapters of peace and justice organizations which was really tremendous because they range the gamut. They had the gay-lesbian union or whatever. They had the Palestine Liberation Front, and they had the UT Jewish students in the same organization, United Farm Workers, the AFL-CIO. So I brought a neighborhood thing to that. So that was the Austin Peace and Justice Coalition. It flourished for a while and then diminished. Then just in the last 3, or 4, 5 years, it's been reconstituted as the Austin Center for Peace and Justice. DANIEL LLANES:	The SOS is the Save Our Springs coalition or initiative that worked to preserve the Edwards Aquifer watershed, Austin's part of it. PODER is People Organized in Defense of Earth and its Resources, and that is an organization that was actually founded by Susana and a couple of other women. Then all the rest of us in the neighborhood joined in. But it is the only Latino grassroots environmental justice organization. PODER is distinguished from other environmental organizations because PODER includes human beings and the urban environment as a place of concern. Most environmental groups are concerned with water, air, the land, and stuff like that, but very few understand that human beings are also animals to be protected.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yes.FEMALE_1:	I don't know if you want to get somewhere else.DANIEL LLANES:	That's Okay.FEMALE_1:	But I was curious as to how you both met. It sounds like you already told a little bit of how that happened, but if you can just-DANIEL LLANES:	Did we meet at Danzantes first, right?SUSANA ALMANZA:	Danzantes, yes.DANIEL LLANES:	Okay. That has to do with my dance thing. Which is very interesting because as a Chicano in Central Texas, I got into dance and I got into modern dance which is white, and then I got into ballet and then I studied all these other forms from all over the world and wound up at the end being introduced to Maria Salinas and Aztlan, Folklorico Aztlan. Then I had a hunger to learn the Mexican dances, and so I did, and I joined the Aztlan group. When you dance in the Folklorico, you dance [00:30:00] all the regions of Mexico but you always start out with the Aztec dances. DANIEL LLANES:	Keep in mind, I've studied all these dance forms, all these dances and things like that. Everything has feeling, has a signature. What I noticed when I was dancing with this company was that, we would dance all the different dances. They're fun, they're great, they're hard, all that kind of stuff. The Aztec dances had a very distinct energy, very interesting, very different. And right around that time -- I've been a dancer and a musician, and right around that time, somebody introduced me to the pan pipes. When I would play the pan pipes, I would get kind of dizzy but then I'd also get excited. If I get excited enough, I'd start moving around and then I noticed that I didn't get dizzy. I started dancing and playing at the same time, right around the same time that I met the Concheros.DANIEL LLANES:	Roen Salinas who was the Director of the Aztlan group, I was telling him how the Aztec dances feel so different than the Veracruz and all that, and he says, ""You notice that?"" I said, ""Yeah."" He said, ""Well, you know those?"" Then he told me the history of the Aztec dances, the Concheros, the Matlachines. But the Concheros in particular are these clans of dance families that started in 1530. One of those clans made it to the United States in the late '60s. Maria Salinas brought one of the maestros and he started what they call a mesa of the Aztec dancers, the Concheros, in Texas, in New Mexico, and in California. Then I was introduced to the Concheros and Susana was part of that group.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yeah. We were part of  [inaudible 00:31:54] en Aztlan.DANIEL LLANES:	 [inaudible 00:31:54] en Aztlan.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Under the mesa de Directiva de Dolores because everybody has a -- a board of directors, I guess, would be the equivalent in the Western world. But you also have, like here you would have the flag. Well, in the Concheros, you have the Virgen, their estandarte. That flag.DANIEL LLANES:	Your standard or your symbol.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Your symbol. Our symbol was the Virgen of Dolores. But that's how Daniel and I began to know each other because we were both Danzante doing indigenous dancing, that's where we were very rooted. Because if you look at it, danza is a song except you don't sing it in words, you sing it with your body and you connect with the elements. Whether you're dancing with the air or you're dancing with the water, or you're dancing with the earth, or you're dancing with the sun. Part of our whole culture is that we're connected to our natural resources and through danza, that is where Daniel and I, we connected and started our friendship.DANIEL LLANES:	We shared that.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Because we shared the danza in common and a lot of other things. Now that I hear him, we have a lot of things in common. But it was through danza that we began our friendship, then later on as  PODER was created. Then like Daniel said, I hadn't seen him in a while because we started doing our own separate things at one time and we saw each other at the H-E-B store.DANIEL LLANES:	Right.SUSANA ALMANZA:	I started talking to him. ""Hey, what's going on? What's happening."" He lived right across the street from the Roy Guerrero Park and we started talking about that and some of the issues, and before you knew it, we were involved in having those meetings early on in the creation of the Roy Guerrero Park. It's a 365-acre jewel in East Austin which a lot of people don't know. But Daniel helped to form the Keepers of the Roy Guerrero Colorado River Park. Then we started the Festival de las Plantas there, which we had connections because indigenous healings and plants, the Concheros.DANIEL LLANES:	The Concheros run those in Mexico.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yes. We're very much connected and we knew how things could and should be run, and how we need to bring those traditional values into the community, at the same time trying to preserve that 365-acre park, because everybody wanted to develop. Somebody wanted it to be a theme park.DANIEL LLANES:	Develop it. But what Susana was talking about, I just want to touch on danza and ceremony, and that hearkening back to the indigenous part of us. I want to tell you that when I reached the age of 30, I felt like I knew everything about my European roots [00:35:00] and I knew very little about my indigenous roots. So on that form that you have of, what is your ethnicity and what is your religion? On religion, the Concheros reflect that enduring connection and recognition that we are part of nature. We don't sit separate on top of nature, that we are a leaf of nature, we are an animal of nature and through ceremony, we re-establish our heartbeat with the heartbeat of the earth and the heartbeat of the cosmos. That is part of our cultural heritage and it translates politically, because the example of Colorado River Park, it's the one and only Park in the City of Austin that brings together. Half of the park is dedicated to people and the other half is dedicated to wildlife. We ensured that the park had as much importance understanding of the wildlife as the people, and there's no other park in the city like that. That park reflects our cultural values which are very different from the established white world, a world that I consider is very adolescent and in its growing up and maturing, is been very damaging to the earth. DANIEL LLANES:	I don't know where we are at the end of this but there's a great story. It's called the Story of the Four Colors and it's told by the Wampanoag Indian elders and it's a really beautiful story that talks about the four races, and how we were all one at one point and how we all became separated by the Great Cataclysm where the continent split apart, and because then became seasons, our skin colors changed and we forgot that we were connected. In these days, this is the time of the integration right now. What the modern calendar considers the 21st century is the time of the integration. In the United States, and as an artist, I reflect that and live it in Central Texas culture. What I'm saying is that, in the time of the integration, all of those elements are present in our culture today and they're are in our children. DANIEL LLANES:	Our children know about the Yellow race, our children know about the Black race, our children know about the Red race which they are part of, and our children know about the White race and they embody that, and that's the time of the integration. This is when we are evolving from being black, white, brown, green, blue to being human beings, to realizing that we're brothers and sisters, and that we're all family. Someone, in regards to this interview, asked me about what was important to me. If we're at the end, I just want to leave that with, the most important things are love and respect, and care, and of course, humor. If you have those four things as your guiding force, then the world will get better and that's what we need to do.FEMALE_1:	Well, thank you so much for your time.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Thank you for having us.DANIEL LLANES:	Hey, we ended it.SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yes. Thank you, Daniel.DANIEL LLANES:	Susana, thanks for the --SUSANA ALMANZA:	For touching our heart with all of your wisdom and words.DANIEL LLANES:	You think?SUSANA ALMANZA:	Yes, very much.DANIEL LLANES:	Oh, Lord.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Not only will Grandma turn 90 years old, but the restaurant that she and our grandfather started, Matt's El Rancho, will celebrate its 60th anniversary, making it the oldest family owned restaurant in Austin. It has grown from a tiny restaurant seating 40 on East First Street to an Austin institution on South Lamar, that can seat more than 500. We're here today to capture some of my grandma's favorite stories about the restaurant. Grandma, how did you feel when Grandpa said he wanted to open a restaurant? The first time he said it to you.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I said, ""Oh, please don't talk about restaurant to me. I could never cook in a restaurant, please just don't ask me anymore."" Finally he said, ""don't you worry about it. We start with a little restaurant that you and I can take care of. I don't want you to worry about cooking anything special, except what you used to cook for me and the children. That would be great, if you can do that."" Then I said, ""Well, Matt it's not going to be that easy. I'm willing to help you."" He said, ""I knew you would."" When he found this little house on First street, it used to be First street to East First street and it was on the corner of San Jacinto and First so he says, ""I saw where we're going to be, I just want a little house there. Now, I want you to come with me, we'll go look at the little house."" I said, ""Okay, let's go."".Janie Gaitan Martinez:	So we went to check on the little house, and I said, ""Matt, this is too busy in here. This is what just what we're looking for. For something busy, where people goes back and forth all day, and all traffic it's just wonderful."" I said, ""Okay, so we begin from there. We start looking to see if we needed some repairs."" Of course, we did need to enforce the kitchen, and check on the dinning room [inaudible 00:03:14] and then I said, ""How many people who are going to be able to sit in this room? Is this about 40?"" I said, ""40, oh my God."" I said, ""Okay."" I had no recipes whatsoever. The only experience I had, was cooking at home for the children. So he says, ""Don't worry because I'll be right there to help you."" I said, ""Okay. If that's going to be the case, I think we'll be okay."" I had no dreams that we're going to keep on growing, but anyway that's what we just started. The way we started.Speaker 1:	And for the record Janie, what is your husband's name?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Matt Gonzalez Martinez.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Grandma, where did you learn to cook? Who taught you?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	My mother. I always love to be in the kitchen with her. I must have been at least nine. I follow her everywhere. I remember her putting a little coke bottle, a soft drink bottle by the table where she worked, and I stepped on that little bottle, so I could reach what she was doing. I said, ""Mama please, let me do that."" So she let me. I was watching everything she was doing. Half of the time we used vegetables from my garden and we used to raise chickens for my yard and stuff like that. She showed me how to make flour tortillas and how to all this dishes and with everything was very healthy. I don't remember her using too much oil or [00:05:00] grease or anything. She was very careful about that. So I learnt at the beginning how to cook healthy. Anything else?Michael Muela:	I do have some more questions for you. So in the National Geographic travel guide, they mentioned El Rancho and it's old school style cooking. You just talked about how you cook. How is your cooking old-school cooking?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I think my old cooking school was to cook healthy. Everything I cook I remember what l cook for me, my husband, and my children. I guess that's what they meant. It's a healthy cooking, and it's with your heart. With love for your family, and when you have love to do cooking and baking or whatever you do, with love, you can do miracles. That's what I think I did.Audrey Muela Glicker:	You sure did. Grandma, when you were young your daddy died. How old were you?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Probably about seven.Audrey Muela Glicker:	So you had to drop out of school to help your mom?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I had to drop out of school when I was pretty young. I remember exactly how old I was. I hated to drop out, but we have to help my mother. I had an older brother, who is three years older than I. We were the oldest ones than the rest of them. I had another brother and three sisters. So we had to help my mother to survive, because it was during the Depression. So we had to learn everything we could, from the garden to the honeybees we had in the yard, we had chickens, and we had a cow. We also had a couple of pigs. We were on the outskirts of town, so we could do all of that. That was very interesting to us. Okay.Audrey Muela Glicker:	It was a pretty big sacrifice for you to drop out of school and help your mom, but then later when you started the restaurant, she made a big sacrifice, and she helped take care of the kids while you had the restaurant.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	When she heard what we were doing, her kids were married and gone, so she said, ""Janie I can come and stay overnight."" Then I said, ""Mom, can you move with us, and live with us."" She said, ""I would love that."" First we have to estimate, and Matt says, ""don't estimate because that's beautiful, don't even ask me."" That's what we did, and she lived with us in our home for 25 years.Michael Muela:	Wow.Audrey Muela Glicker:	When you started the restaurant, you were 30 years old and -Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes.Audrey Muela Glicker:	- you had three kids -Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes.Audrey Muela Glicker:	- and my mom was just seven months old, is that right?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Your mother was my youngest, and of course mother loved her, and she loved my mother. All the children were crazy about my mother. I come home and sometimes, after a while when we got some help, I would come home at five o'clock, go into morning prepare the lunches, everything that I cook for the people they help when they come in, everything was ready.Michael Muela:	Grandma, can you tell us about the first time you met Grandpa?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	My girlfriends and I were going on a Sunday. We either go swimming at Barton Springs or we would go bike riding. The first time he asked me to go bike riding, I said to myself, ""I don't have a bike. I've never been on a bike in my life. What am I going to do? Try the best you can."" I said. At the back of my mind I said, ""Try the best you can."" So, I got on that bike and I was the last one, and I said, ""I have to catch on. I can't afford to let them go and I'm going to be in the back, way back, away from them. I have to try again."" Pretty soon I caught on, I caught up with them. Then these guys, some were walking, some were riding bikes. There were no football, baseball games.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Come by and talk to him, to us and my husband came to me and said, ""Hi, what's your name?"" I answered him. He says, ""Where are you going? I said, ""I don't know. I'll probably go to Zaragosa Park."" He says, ""That's where we are going. We just finished the game, we were going to go back for something."" So they just walked or ride the bikes. So we got over there and finally we decided it's time for us [00:10:00] to come back to the park and return the bikes. He says, ""Where do you go to Church?"" I said, ""I go to Guadalupe Church. He says, ""I do too. Are you going to church on Sunday?"" I said, ""Of course, I'll go. I always go to church on Sunday."" He said, ""What other days you go?"" I said, ""I'll go on Thursday and Friday."" Because I was singing in the choir. So he says, ""I'll see you in church."" I said okay. This is what we started with.Speaker 1:	Do you remember, Janie, what he looked like that first time you met him?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	He looked pretty handsome. He looked very handsome, and he had big rough shoulders because he was training himself, exercising to be a boxer. So he was very handsome and broad kid with a little waist, because he was always running and practicing to be a boxer. So I thought he was very handsome. So after that you see him in church. On Sundays we had fiestas and we saw coronations. We had the ladies cook and we served food out there. I'd be there, be helping all the young girls would be waitresses. By then I didn't have any more coronation because I sold them all. So we were going to help him in the kitchen, serve the food, and then we walk around. They would be following us talking to us. That's how everything began.Michael Muela:	Grandma, I remember a story you told us the other day where you're saying that Grandpa couldn't afford to buy any food from you because he had spent all his money buying flowers from you because he wanted to talk to you.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	That's right. He couldn't order a plate of food. The rest of them couldn't either. They just walked around to see when we were going to go finish so they can walk around with us because we didn't have any money those days. But we made a lot of money for the church.Speaker 1:	Was it hard working with your husband when he started the restaurant or did you like it? Were you a good team?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	We were a very good team because we never argued. He would say in the morning when we got up, or went to the grocery store because I wanted to fix him a plate lunches first, then the Mexican food too. But I made a few, story was maybe 10 lunches and Mexican food. So we stopped by the store and he says, ""What are we buying today?"" I said, ""Let's go look at the vegetables first."" So we looked at the vegetables first. I looked to see what was the freshest vegetables to cook that day. I said in my mind what else I was going to put together with it.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	The meat was no problem because we had Slaughters, meat packing company across the alley from the building where we were from the little house. So we just call them and bring whatever we needed of meat. So that was easy. But picking up the vegetables for the day was early in the morning. But we always make beautiful lunches and those would go first. I said, ""I see it for the lunches."" Now, we had number one dinners, regular dinners and combination of tacos, and we had a special with two tacos and something else, I forgot what it was.Audrey Muela Glicker:	All the Mexican food?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	They were [inaudible 00:13:50] he'd run and help me a little bit and go back, because he was doing good. We had one dishwasher and another person in the back bringing in things that I needed, more vegetables, more avocados or more whatever. That's the way we kept going.Michael Muela:	Grandma, you said that Grandpa was almost more than your husband. Can you describe your relationship?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Well, I guess the reason why we got along so well is because we were best friends. I could tell him anything and he would said don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. I love him like a husband, but he was my best friend. I respect him like my father because I didn't have a father and he had lost his parents when he was young. So he called me Mama and sometimes Janie. If people were around us, he called me Janie, but if we were cooking, he says, ""No, Mama, we don't need this much food. [00:15:00] We'll have to do this and that."" I had no recipes. What I had is in my head. What we used to cook at home, I just open it up every three times and that's the way I kept on cooking.Audrey Muela Glicker:	That's why no one could ever steal your recipes. There are no recipes to steal. There have been so many restaurants that have opened in Austin since El Rancho has been open. How do you feel when people copy you or trying to get your recipe?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Well, they can, and they tried real hard, but they could never taste like mine.Michael Muela:	People used to ask Grandpa all the time how he would make certain things and what did you tell him?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	One time we went out with this couple and this couple were in the same business as we were and this fellow were after our seasoning in the kitchen. Matt started telling him how. ""Matt, tell me how you cook the taco meat. Please tell me, you have the best taco meat, I can't believe how delicious it is. "" Matt start to say, and I just kick him right here, in this bone on the front of his leg. I kick him and he just looked at me and he stop talking.Michael Muela:	He said he forgot the recipe, right?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	He said, ""Well, I don't know, or else."" Because it was hidden. We never talk about that ever again, never. He didn't ask me. He didn't say, why were you doing this? No. Just he had. It was all already done, we fix it and that's it.Audrey Muela Glicker:	What do you think makes El Rancho so special? Why do people keep coming back for 60 years?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Well because first thing is my husband was the most friendly person you can find anywhere I still remember. He would greet everybody by handshake and make him comfortable and suggest what we had. If they asked what ingredients we had, and he would say, ""She cooks like she did at home for me and my children. So you can't go wrong with cooking, home cooking the way she cooks, so come on in, try whatever."" But people loved him so much, because he was friendly and always very friendly with everybody, the same with everybody, the same with the help.Audrey Muela Glicker:	He would go out with his business card and hand them out on the streets and say, ""If you don't like it, you don't have to pay."" Was that right?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Across the street the cars were going, but as he passed people walking, and he would hand out the business cards and say, ""Come and try our food, and if you don't like it, you don't have to pay for it."" So they came in and they came in so much that we got so busy, that the next year we had to build. We had a little front porch in that house, we had to build a big dining room in the front. They came all the way to almost the sidewalk, that we couldn't go too far out, because the sidewalk was there. That was a surprise that we started hiring people. People would go from walking on the sidewalk to town or to catch the bus or whatever. He would say, ""Sir, would you like to work or you're looking for a job? What kind of work?"" He would say, ""Well come on in I'll show you."" He couldn't say whatever because we would take him to the kitchen and show him what we needed or in the front. So a lady came by. That lady stayed with us for almost 30 years.Audrey Muela Glicker:	He was a good boss because we've had employees who've worked there their whole lives.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I showed her how to make pralines and she made pralines, tamales, sopapillas and chile rellenos. She was beautiful. Then of course we hired more help, but he was amazing. I was so happy to have her, until one day my aunt Sarah, she was married to my daddy's brother calling me, insisted, ""Janie, would you like for me to help you in the kitchen?"" I said, ""Oh my goodness of course I would love for your help."" She was amazing too. So she saved my life then, because I was getting too busy.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	But I never complained. I said, I'm in here to do the best I can, we just hired people here and I [00:20:00] taught them how to do it by then, I said I won't make recipes for everything. I said, I can't go on like this, how am I going to teach people to help us. So I have to make recipes. So I sat down, and start putting my stuff together and making recipes. Then people would come, some cooks from another kitchens come, and wanted to work with us. I said, ""Here's the recipe. But first I want to show you."" I show him how to prepare it, and then I give him the recipe.Speaker 1:	Why did you do that?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Well, I had to teach him before I could let the kitchen go. My husband wanted me out of the kitchen and I said, ""I stay with the salads. I cannot let anybody do the salad."" Because I want to teach him real good how to do it, how to season guacamole and how to do all the special sauces. He says, ""Okay, stay there a little bit longer, but I had a chef already taken a place. Impromptu, we hired four, five young men, they were going to school from a family. The last name was Alinaz. Those guys were wonderful workers. The oldest was in the kitchen. The second one was all over the place doing different things, and the other ones were buss boys and waiters. They stayed with us until they graduated from school and got their jobs.Michael Muela:	Grandma, I'm glad you talked about teaching the cooks your recipes because a lot of restaurants will never make it to 60 years and it's because the quality or the consistency just isn't there after so many years, but you still go back to the kitchen and just last week you were showing the chefs how to make your recipes and you still make sure everything tastes the way that it should be.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I love to do that and I love to go through the line, while the cooks are dishing out stuff, and I check their sauces, and I can tell you, manager of the kitchen. I said, ""Josias come here. This sauce is not supposed to look like this. This one is too thick.... "" I talk to him, and he's happy. I make sure that they're happy, and we have a restaurant is run like a big family. Everybody knows each other, everybody is friendly with each other. Our general manager is very gentle with the help and so is the rest of the help. So we have great help and I feel blessed. Then another thing I want to say, I'm also blessed with my daughters, they are so grown up right now. The oldest, my son, Matt Martinez Jr. passed away two years, over two years. So I have Gloria Reyna, Cecilia Muela and Cathy Kreitz. Those girls are wonderful in the business. Then comes my grandchildren, which I'm very proud of. Especially Audrey and Michael, they are always close to me and to my heart. All my grandchildren are beautiful, they're wonderful, they're loving. I love each one of them, dearly.Audrey Muela Glicker:	We love you grandma, so much.Michael Muela:	Grandma, it's not easy to say how much you do for us. But without you in our lives, I don't know what it would be like. You give us so much. It's almost a blessing in our family to come down with a cold or a sore throat because my grandma will make you a batch of her homemade chicken soup.Audrey Muela Glicker:	A pot of soup.Michael Muela:	As soon as she catches wind that's you're under the weather, she'll make you a big pot of just the most delicious chicken soup you've ever had and make sure you get it.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I don't know how you make it so fast, grandma.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I still love to cook. Of course, I don't cook as much as I want to because I guess I'm tired. But I still have that love for good food, not just in food, I had for children not to eat healthy. I think all my kids knows how to cook healthy.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Grandma, that's one thing that's so inspiring about you is the way you take care of yourself. You're 90 years old and you have your trainer Q, and you work out a few times a week. You used to do yoga. You go in the pool. You go to the doctor before you get sick to stay healthy. You cook healthy, and eat healthy.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I like to train and do [00:25:00] exercise every day. Of course, when my trainer comes it's a different story, but I like to exercise always.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Where did you learn to take care of yourself like that?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I think is because of Matt. He was always exercising or running. He'd do push ups on the floor, and the kids would be on top of him, and he would be up and down the push ups. Especially your mama, Cecilia, she hang onto his back, and I don't know how she would stay on. Her little hair was just draping down and he was going up and down, and she wouldn't let go.Michael Muela:	Grandma, some of my earliest memories growing up are when James and I were too young to go to church with the family so they would drop us off at the restaurant and we would walk around with you and Grandpa and watch the tortilla maker make tortillas. I still remember that.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I love that too.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Get a hot tortilla with sauce or with cheese inside.Audrey Muela Glicker:	That was so delicious. Grandma, what would you say was the happiest moment in your life?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I think it's when my kids started growing up, and the store happened, and the business, and everybody was there. My mother was there. My mother came and told me one day that she's never been as happy as she was being with us. She was cleaning some fish from a son that he had brought home at the porch where, thank God, her current kids are and said, ""Mom, I am too."" She was the best helper in the world because without my mother living with us, I don't think I could have done the business or help as much as I did.Audrey Muela Glicker:	It's amazing what you did.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Thank you.Michael Muela:	Grandma, do you think that your mother being in your life the way that she did influenced the way that you are so involved in our lives the way that you are?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	She was very loving to her children. She was very loving to her grandkids. When she lived with us, our kids didn't know which was the mother. I am a grandmother because I love her so much. We had a happy life all the way with her and the kids and the business. We have always been very blessed and we never worry about not making even her not to worry about anything because we had a lot of faith that we're going to be just fine. We're doing everything, we still toil for our children and our grandchildren.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I remember when Grandpa got sick, one day he told us, ""Don't worry about me. I had a long, happy life."" He was so strong when he was sick. It was just beautiful to watch you take care of Grandpa when he had Parkinson's disease.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I did the best I could with him. I took care of him until the end. He knew that I was there. I had help around the clock for him and I never left the house without him if I was taking him to the doctor, and I had all kinds of help. I had somebody to drive us. I had the best help I could find so he was always happy.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I wish everyone could see what a beautiful, happy life you could have even when you're sick, because he was so happy.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	He never stopped smiling.Audrey Muela Glicker:	He didn't. What would you say is your hope for the restaurant and for your children?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I just hope that if my children also like the business, they should keep it and share it. When they get tired of it, pass it on to the current kids. If the current children won't appreciate it, just enjoy what you can.Michael Muela:	Grandma, do you think the restaurant is the same or better than it was 60 years ago? How do you feel about it now overall?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	The food is just as good. It's not the same because my husband is not there. He was the main person. People can tell you now, they still miss him because he was always in the front greeting everybody. He always greeted them. Even when we had a room of 40 people, he'd still greet them. He never stopped that until he was sick.Audrey Muela Glicker:	In the beginning, when you and Grandpa, you were working [00:30:00] 18-hour days when you started.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Did you ever feel like giving up? What kept you going?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	The love we had for our children. We wanted our children to have a better life than we did. We worked too hard when we were little. During the Depression was not easy for the parents. So I was very happy that my children have a better life now, and everybody's happy.Michael Muela:	Grandma, it sounded like church and religion was a big part of you and Grandpa's life.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes.Michael Muela:	All throughout your life, you always gave so generously to priests, nuns and religious.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	We never charged them.Michael Muela:	You still do that. Why is that?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Because we were blessed and we got a lot of food to share. So the religious priests and sisters, whoever came by, always ate with us. No charge for them. Even when we just had a few tables.Audrey Muela Glicker:	They've become some of your best friends, haven't they?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Like Sister Gertrude?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes. We're best friends. Sister Gertrude from Seton Hospital, is my very best friend. We still keep in touch and she comes to eat with us.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Do you have any advice for your grandchildren or your children?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Just to love each other and share with each other, and that's it.Michael Muela:	I think that everyone does that pretty much in our family.Audrey Muela Glicker:	We have a beautiful family. We have fun getting together, maybe it's because the food is so good. Grandma, what are you most proud of?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I'm proud of my family and regular customers that come, and they tell us how many years they've been coming to eat with us. It makes me so proud. I'm so proud of those people that come and look for us, especially me, and tell us and my daughters how much they enjoy the food. I'm actually enjoying their hospitality, every part of it starting with the waiters, the host, everybody. As soon as you walk in, you see a smiling face. How many places can you go where everybody looks happy?Michael Muela:	Few, if any.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	We're always happy. It's a happy family, and it's a happy business.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Did people ever asked you and Grandpa if you wanted to expand?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yes, they did. But my husband says one was plenty. One business, you take care of it and nobody is going to take of it like your own people. That's why I'm proud to have my children involved in there, like my daughters.Speaker 1:	I'm very curious Janie to know because you talked about your husband, Matt, as being your husband and also your best friend, but you were also business partners, so you must have spent a lot of time working next to one another. I'm wondering, if working with him so closely taught you anything about one another or what things did you learn from each other? Were there any surprises?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Well, he didn't know too much about cooking. He did some cooking, but he didn't have too much experience in cooking since his mother died when he was very small, and his daddy died when he was 13. What we did is just cook together and talk about how we can always improve it. We never had time to argue to each other. We just loved what we were doing, we loved each other, and we got opportunity to travel many places after we started doing good and we had good help, we did that. That made me very proud that we could do that together.Michael Muela:	Grandma, you've been all over the world with Grandpa.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	No. We went on a cruise, then we went to the Vatican in Rome and we went to the French Riviera in France, and we went to Milan, [00:35:00] Florence.Michael Muela:	You spent some time in Egypt, didn't you?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Oh, yes. It was a long trip in Egypt, 18 days. That was beautiful. Then we went to, let me see where else did we go?Michael Muela:	Even on these trips, you said that everyone was so friendly to you and grandpa because he was always so friendly to everyone.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Yeah, he was too friendly, and the hotels where we stayed, somebody was always taking care of him. He was loved everywhere. We went to Hawaii several times, we went to Mexico, Mexico City, you name it in Mexico. We traveled quite a bit, it was beautiful.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I love the story of when you were in the Holy Lands and you didn't like the breakfast they were giving you, so you went back to the kitchen and taught them how to scramble eggs.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	They were giving us boiled eggs, it was 19 of us. Boiled eggs and pita bread and preserves.Michael Muela:	You wanted some scrambled eggs?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Everybody was saying, ""Janie tell them to cook for us some scrambled eggs."" I told them, but they didn't understand me. So I said, ""Excuse me."" I went to the kitchen I said, ""Can I come in? "" He says, ""Sure, come on in."" I went to the chef and asked, ""You know what scrambled eggs are?"" He says I show him. I showed him and pretty soon he sends a big old platter of scrambled eggs. Everybody was, ""Yay!""Audrey Muela Glicker:	You saved the day.Speaker 1:	Where was this? For clarification?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	It was in Egypt.Speaker 1:	When were you there?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	I was there, oh God, let me see 15, about 20 years ago.Michael Muela:	Twenty?Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Maybe 22 or so. It was real fun riding the camels and stuff.Audrey Muela Glicker:	I'm amazed you're so brave.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Anyway.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Oh, grandma, I think we're almost out of time.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Go ahead.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Michael and I just want to thank you for agreeing to do this because your stories and your wisdom are such a treasure for your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren, and your great, great grandchildren. We're proud to be a part of the restaurant and we're proud to have you as our grandmother. You've taught us to never be afraid, to follow our dreams, and to take care of ourselves and our families and to always thank God because we're so blessed.Janie Gaitan Martinez:	Don't ever say, ""I can't do it."" Because you can do it. You can do anything your heart desires, but you have to try it. But don't say, ""I don't know how to do it, I can't stand that."" I always say you can try. Believe me, you can do it. You'd will.Audrey Muela Glicker:	Thank you for all you do for us, but especially for your love.

mby008852,"Jeremy Cantu:	[00:00:00] My name's Jeremy Cantu. I'm 37. Today is January 22nd, 2012 in Austin, Texas. I'm here with my wife Karina.Karina Cantu:	My name is Karina Peris Cantu. I'm 32 years old. Today is January 22nd, 2012. We are in Austin, Texas, and I'm here with my husband Jeremy.Jeremy Cantu:	One thing I've always wanted to know is what actually do you remember what was going through your head when you first saw me and where was that at?Karina Cantu:	I first saw you sitting in Lydia, I don't want to say her last name's, office at Court of Travis County, when you were being interviewed to become a volunteer there. I was working there, and I was going to stay late, and I dropped out. I had tons of food in my hand because I was just going to eat dinner there. Then I saw you and the girl that interviewed said,""He's so cute."" That's what I remember when I first saw you.Jeremy Cantu:	What was your first impression of me?Karina Cantu:	That you were a quiet, serious guy, which you're still quiet but you're not that serious anymore.Jeremy Cantu:	I would like to know what dreams you actually have for us. Have you ever thought about it or?Karina Cantu:	I hope that we are able to have children in our home and that we live this silly American dream of traveling, and getting old, and seeing kids off to college so that we can be all by ourselves again.Interviewer:	Can I go back and ask about when you guys first met? So that's the first time that you saw Jeremy but how did you actually meet? Can we talk about the first time that you had an interaction and how that led to a date?Karina Cantu:	Yes. Jeremy was getting sworn in to become a volunteer that works with abused and neglected kids. He was at the court getting sworn in by the judge there, and I organized the swearing in party ceremony for the volunteers. Then you were sitting outside of the courtroom and asked me or I said something that was like, "" Elephante is coming in to play, "" and that's a band that we like. I said, I wanted to go see it and you were going to try to get tickets or something and that never happened. But then you asked me for my phone number and I was very nervous about giving it to you because you were a volunteer and I was working there. I think I asked you to e-mail me, and then that's how you said that you had an extra ticket to go see Ozomatli. Knowing that you passed your FBI background checks and everything to participate in the volunteer program, I said yes. That was our first date, going to see Ozomatli.Interviewer:	What happened after the first date? Were you like, ""Yes, solidified. I want to be with this person.""Karina Cantu:	No. I allowed you to take me out several times before I think we solidified our first kiss on your birthday. We both got passes to South by Southwest Film Festival and we saw like three or four movies a day, so I equate that to three or four dates in a week. That's how we bonded on movies, and music, and hanging out and getting to know each other.Interviewer:	What do you remember of that Jeremy?Jeremy Cantu:	I remember all the constants unknown chaperones that were always around and I really liked Karina, so I had to be okay with it. But there was always friends that came by or popped in or checked in so it was okay because I wanted to get to know the people that were important to her in her life. [00:05:00] That took a while to understand that but that ended up being a good thing. So when we finally became a couple, I had already known these people. I guess, I already passed their background check, so that was a good thing.Interviewer:	Do you remember your first day without a chaperone?Jeremy Cantu:	I think it was the Elephante one. It was one of the first one and that was the night of my birthday. That was a memorable night. There's a picture that we have, and I'm not very photogenic, and I actually look pretty decent with the pieces of the Austin skyline in the background. For some reason that picture has been in our houses that we've lived in. It always ends up in our room and it always pops up from time to time. It was always cool to see that picture and to have memories of that night.Interviewer:	Can you talk about that night? Why was it so memorable?Jeremy Cantu:	It was my birthday and then that was the night that we kissed for the first time.Karina Cantu:	Two months after we met.Jeremy Cantu:	Yes.Karina Cantu:	Two months after our first date.Jeremy Cantu:	I would like to know who has been the most important person in your life? I know growing up in South Texas, where you're from, were there a lot of role models or were there people that helped shape you to be who you are today? Because you're right now very unique and you definitely beat your own drum.Karina Cantu:	There are lots of people I'm a prime example of. It takes a village to raise a child. I had so many great role models that encouraged me. Mom Doyle was one. She was a theater teacher and she actually completed, not completed for me, but with me, my college application. Paid the application fee because I didn't have the money for it. Then once I got accepted to the University of Texas at Austin, she took me shopping and that was the first time I ever had my own blow dryer or my own bed in a bag. I'd never even had heard of that, of what a bed in a bag was. So she was really helpful. Another theater teacher, Lisa Morris, was really good at keeping me focused on theater. I'm not a famous actress but it's still something that I do. But my mom was consistent as much as I can see now as an adult how hard it was for her to raise us and how poor we were and just not having enough money, and not having a father that lived there, and then having me as a child, which was really dramatic I'm sure. I may not have agreed with all of her decisions on how she raised me but she was there and sometimes the mother is still a child also, and she did what she could.Interviewer:	What do you mean you didn't agree with all of her decisions, can you give an example?Karina Cantu:	I don't know. I think that she was really focused on just paying bills and I was unsupervised a lot. Luckily though, I found people that were able to take me in and I'd spent time at their homes. Ronnie, one of my best friends, her family, I ate dinner at their house all the time. I hope I don't do that with my kids, just let them run free, but I was able to find some really good people that helped shape who I am. I wasn't you know 12 pregnant, I'm 32 have a master's degree, so two different routes that I could have taken.Interviewer:	Why do you think you took the other route?Karina Cantu:	I took the other route because people around me influenced me and encouraged me to stay on the right track. My father, he wouldn't live with us but he really had us feeling guilty if we didn't do well in school. Then my sister was a great example of just [00:10:00] walking the lines that my dad would say. He's a Johnny Cash fan, so we'd walk the line.Jeremy Cantu:	When did you realize that you'd never move back to the valley?Karina Cantu:	I didn't make a conscious effort. I didn't say I would never move back, but I was up here doing summer youth theater. I got involved in a theater company nearby and just got really involved. I was doing everything that I could for that company. When I was doing that summer youth program my dad and my step mom came up to see the play. My step mom saw me interacting with the kids and with the staff and then with parents and just saw me in my element, I guess. She told me, ""You're never moving back, are you? You've made your home here."" I had never even thought that I was supposed to move back. I didn't have a room to go home to. I didn't have a house to come home to. I would sleep on the floor for the summers or when I'd go home for vacation on the weekends. So, I didn't think I had an invitation necessarily to come back home. Yeah, that's when I just realized that I can stay up here and that theater company is what really made me love Austin even more. I have my own theater family up here.Jeremy Cantu:	With me growing up in the very late '70s, I always had a vision of Chicano and Chicana power and culture. That was one of the first things you presented yourself as, as a proud Chicana. I thought that was different and cool because you're so young. I just wanted to know, when did you discover that? When did you learn to identify with being a Chicana? How did you discover that identity?Karina Cantu:	Well, growing up in the Rio Grande Valley I didn't know I was Mexican or Mexican American. I would watch TV and I thought Bill Cosby looked just like my dad. I thought George Jefferson looked like my dad. I just thought the whole world was Mexican and did everything the way that I did. I didn't know that things that I did were because of my culture until I came to Austin. Then I was treated differently by some people. I was told to go back to Mexico. I was told that, don't say your name in Spanish because we're not in Mexico. People just didn't understand the bi-cultural life that I lived in the valley and how I didn't want to lose that because that's who shaped me into who I was. I slowly started meeting some other people at UT and taking some Mexican American study classes and realizing the impact that we've had on history and just to celebrate our culture. Don't hide it. Don't feel like everybody thinks that you should go back to Mexico. You should introduce people to it. You should make them comfortable with it. So I just wanted to hold onto that part. I used to joke that if I ever introduced myself as Karina, that my grandfather would be flipping in his grave because it's not who he was and I wanted to hold onto that. So I wanted to always introduce myself as Karina.Jeremy Cantu:	What are you proudest of in your life?Karina Cantu:	Well, having a successful relationship with you. Because I know I can be a little emotional and dramatic. I didn't grow up seeing a loving husband and a loving wife. I didn't see that, so I'm glad that I was able to find that and let you in because you're great.Jeremy Cantu:	What are your hopes and dreams for us in [00:15:00] the future?Karina Cantu:	To grow old together and take care of each other and have a loving home and just become involved in our community and just help those that are maybe on the path that we were on several years ago where I could've been on. Just to make an impact of where we are together.Interviewer:	Can I ask a question to an earlier point? How much is the fact that you identify as Chicana and Jeremy identifies as Mexican-American? How much was that a factor in your relationship and your decision to choose one another as a partner?Karina Cantu:	I don't know if it was that much of a factor. Jeremy didn't grow up or you didn't grow up with necessarily with the Mexican culture around you. You had it in your home, but you didn't have it around you. I definitely was not attracted to you because of your Chicano culture that you had.Jeremy Cantu:	Well, I did have a lot of art. I do have a lot of Mexican folk art and-.Karina Cantu:	You do.Jeremy Cantu:	- paintings and things around the house. Which is funny because they seem to be categorized as clutter now but they were art at one time.Interviewer:	What do you mean that Jeremy didn't grow up with a lot of Mexican culture around him?Karina Cantu:	Do you want to talk about what it was like growing up Mexican-American in Columbus.Jeremy Cantu:	In school it was in the '80s. I grew up in a very predominantly white rural town called Columbus. It's west of Houston on I-10. For the longest time, I couldn't relate to the stuff around me. I got to grow up most of my formative years with my great grandmother living with us. She spoke mostly Spanish. What was funny is all my parents didn't teach us Spanish. Actually, that was the first language I learned as an infant through babysitters and such. It just seemed like being the only Mexican-American family in a white neighborhood. Only one of the few in the school, I just correlate it to acting white. Just look at my name, I've had a hard time dealing with what my mom choose as my name, my first name. I've never liked it, but I respect my mom. You are who you are. It's not what you write down on the blank for first name on the application. It wasn't until later in school when I realized that we were middle-class and that thing, the people coming in from Cuba and Mexico. I was like, ""Wait, I'm one of them and they're not really accepting me because I dress and act white."" Then at the house when we come home and there's homemade tortillas on the comal and you're eating rice and beans, it puts you in your place of what you really are.Interviewer:	How do you feel now? Do you feel like maybe you became a bit more Mexican in your marriage or do you still have one foot in of each culture?Jeremy Cantu:	No, I'm all in. All my Latino culture. It wasn't until college when I got stuck in a dorm with actually a Cuban American, and him and I were the only Latinos on the whole floor. We both actually ended up growing and learning lots about our culture, [00:20:00] and I remember going to his house for dinners and there would be black beans and rice, and we go to my house for dinner, it would be, pinto beans and rice. But, you can chop chicken and beef any way you want it but there's still rice and beans behind it. But he found his identity, and I found mine, and we are still best friends to this day. What was funny is I was getting into the Mexican music that my dad and my grandfather were into, and through his girlfriend at the time who became his wife, they were going into the salsa and the merengues and he was learning his cultural music and we'd go on and on about which ones sounded worse. Now we are into each other's music. I always thought that was really neat that him and I grew up culturally together.Karina Cantu:	You want to talk about how music has influenced you with your culture?Jeremy Cantu:	Like the Mexican music, and we call it Tejanos of mine, my family we listened to. My dad always had this furniture business refinishing antiques and he would always play the same cassette tapes of the same artist over, and over, and over when him and I would be working in the shop and I related it to work and I hated it. Then when I was in college, he took it upon himself to go to the local radio station and he found out what you have to do to get your own radio program. He got his sponsors and so he got his two-hour block of time on Saturday to have his radio show. I used to work at Best Buy and I was always a CD and music freak. I worked there and so he would ask me to buy this CD and buy that CD, and I was at the time when you could actually go in the music stores and they would have CDs you could buy. My boss would look at me because I would have all these alternative CDs and then I would have all these different bands and he was like, ""Why you buying that?"" Then I told him it was for my dad and for a show. Then on Saturday morning, I'd come home and he'd be at the radio station and I would say, ""Hey, play this CD on this track is pretty cool and play this one and play that one."" For about two years I did that and really got into the music and then got into that culture. Then he started booking bands for shows and we'd go scout out bands. In one way, it was a way that him and I got a lot closer to each other because we got to know the musicians and the managers and that type of stuff. It's cool when you go to a club and you're with your old man and you walk in the door and he gets you in free and he's the one in the 60s and you're in your 20s and hanging out backstage. It was neat and I'll always cherish those memories.Interviewer:	What about now? How does music play a role in your life currently?Jeremy Cantu:	I always want music in the background. It's almost like a soundtrack of our lives because I go through different moods and now it's so simple through whatever media service you have. It's easy if you just get music and have it going. I like the fact that Karina and I share the same interest in music, and I want to pass that on if we have kids that it's cool to be the kid that knows Led Zeppelin and The Beatles and they're in elementary school and their friends figure it out much later.Karina Cantu:	Little Joe.Jeremy Cantu:	Little Joe and the other bands that we like. But yeah, it's very important to me. I wanted to ask you through all your travels with your theater companies, and actually travels with school and your experiences, [00:25:00] do you have any regrets since coming to Austin and going to UT and living in Pflugerville Texas now?Karina Cantu:	Well, I try to say that every step that we take has lead us on to the journey that we're on and where we are right now. Although I think I do have a regret of not majoring in theater or going to some kind of theater school. I don't live with, like what if because I'm able to do that now, but I don't know. Then I wish I had studied abroad before the drug cartels took over Mexico when it was safer. I wish I had used a semester, something since I graduated early, but because I was on student loans and wanted to finish as fast as I could. I didn't use that extra semester to study abroad in Mexico.Interviewer:	How about you Jeremy?Jeremy Cantu:	I guess the biggest regret that I have is just being lazy in school because I ended up closing doors for me as far as academically. I guess being an average student it was very easy to be average and it would have taken a lot more work to make straight A's, or even all A's and all B's. Everything was so minimalistic when it came to me getting things done and I wish I would've pushed myself a little harder because I still love the job that I do and the career path I've taken. But I think it took me longer to realize that I'm doing calculus homework in high school and then that it could have benefited me in college. Yeah, that's always been a regret of mine. I guess I'm one that needs a little bit of a push because I have a little bit of self-doubt but when I finally come to realize something and I finally get it straight that's what I want to do, I will do it. It just takes me longer to get there.Karina Cantu:	I can start with my questions. So where is your mom's family from, and where is your dad's family from?Jeremy Cantu:	They come from Mexico. My dad is second generation and my mom is third generation. They both came from very small towns, and I grew up in a small town of less than 4,000 people. I don't even think there were stoplights in either one of those towns, and my dad's from my little small town called Bloomington, Texas, which is near Victoria, and my mom is from a little town called Glidden, which is near my hometown of Columbus.Karina Cantu:	Who has been the most important person in your life? Can you tell me about him or her?Jeremy Cantu:	By far it would be my mom. She's always been there for me. Sometimes she's been there a little more involved than I wanted her to be. She's going to do a 110 percent on everything that she wants to do than you want her to do or vice versa. That's how she had the energy to be a child protective service, child abuse investigator, by day and night, and then raise us and keep us straight, and still being there for Cub Scout meetings and camp outs, and baseball, football, basketball games. Even in college she always would help me move, she would joke that, she was sure you have so many books to carry. She was always [00:30:00] there for me.Karina Cantu:	Your mom is a good example of a mom. I'd like to have some of those qualities should I ever become one. She's a good example of it. What are the funniest stories your family loves to tell about you?Jeremy Cantu:	For my mom, it's always the story about when I was a busboy at a local restaurant. Growing up the grocery stores aren't what they are today. They're only a lot smaller and things are more expensive in the small towns, and you couldn't buy flats of strawberries. One day I was in the one of the coolers at the restaurant and there was some massive flat of strawberries. I got into them and I kept going in there and eating them, and one of the waitresses caught me in there and then she started eating them, and so then we got caught by somebody else. So then, for some reason my mom always thinks that story's so funny. I don't know what it's.Karina Cantu:	Your strawberry addiction.Jeremy Cantu:	Yes, my strawberry addiction.Karina Cantu:	That's where it all started.Jeremy Cantu:	That's where it all came from. That's the funniest story, and then when we would get together for the holidays with my dad's side of the family, certain  members of my family find the story funny and then others, my mom and my aunt, they didn't think it was very funny. My cousin, JD and I, went to go try out his brand new used boat that his uncle gave him. It was Thanksgiving morning and we went out, and all I bought it was a 12 pack of Dr. Peppers and a loaf of bread and a pack of Bologna, and so we're at this maiden voyage. We didn't pay much attention to the conditions of the weather and water, and halfway through our trip, a cold front blew in and took the tide with it, so we were stuck, and we ended up being stuck in the channel of water overnight. Anybody who ever knew me, always remembers me as having a massive wallet in my pocket all the time. They always call it the George Costanza wallet. So I always had tons of business cards and pieces of paper, and that we made it through the night. It got down in the 30s and we had shorts on and t-shirts, and I made a fire with the gasoline from the boat and with my business card and driftwood, the next night, the tide came back in and we took off. It's interesting to realize when you had the coast guard looking for you and your family looking for you. You come back and your mom or your aunt are in tears, hugging you as for them I'll say it was both a very long night.Karina Cantu:	Yeah, that's not funny. That's scary. What are you proudest stuff in your life?Jeremy Cantu:	I guess being successful, going and actually finishing college and after graduation, getting a job in the IT industry, and keeping a job, really never being laid off, and then having that stable part of your life, and then being able to meet my wife and live the life that you think and hope and dream of, going to college, graduating, having a career, and getting married and so that, I've been able to live that life and that's pretty cool.Karina Cantu:	Do you remember what was going through your head when you first saw me?Jeremy Cantu:	The first time I saw you was actually on stage, at one of your shows. Actually, you were playing a pregnant 15-year-old in a quinceanera sketch.Karina Cantu:	A comedy sketch?Jeremy Cantu:	A comedy sketch, yes, and I had no idea who you were other than what was in the program. I don't know, it just seems like that night the lights were shinning a little brighter and it really looked like a star was on the stage. [00:35:00] The sketch was hilarious, is to this day. Actually, it's called Quinceanera Girl. I always I told myself, I'd like to meet that girl one day, seemed totally unattainable at the time. That's what was going through my head.Karina Cantu:	What are your dreams for us?Jeremy Cantu:	I would love to have a couple of kids and teach them the stuff it took me too long to learn a lot quicker, and pass on the stories and the people that have helped shape me into who I am, like my grandmother and my grandfather and my great grandmother. Help them understand how important to know and how good of people that they were.Karina Cantu:	How would you like to be remembered?Jeremy Cantu:	I'd like to be remembered as a very nice guy, a fair guy, and a funny guy, because that's who I am. I try to get along with everybody.Karina Cantu:	Who's been the kindest to you in your life?Jeremy Cantu:	Actually you have been. You're one of the few people that get me, and that's something that I always cherish because you understand me, you get me. I love that about you.Karina Cantu:	Wow, I love that about you too that you're able to understand me and my proudest, brightest moments like getting my masters, and you're able to go to London when I studied abroad. But also in my insecurity, and all the things that come with me. I appreciate you, loving me just the way that I am, and I think we're done.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
mby008854,"Suzanne Mason:	[00:00:00] My name is Suzanne Mason. I'm 51 years old. Today is January 22nd, 2012, and I'm in Austin, Texas and I'm interviewing my friend Jorge Antonio Renaud.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	And my name is Jorge Antonio Renaud. I'm 55 years old, and today is the 22nd day of January, 2012. We are in a Gulfstream trailer parked in the Bob Bullock Museum in Austin, Texas, and I'm with my friend Suzanne Mason.Suzanne Mason:	Okay. So Jorge, I met you three months after you were released from prison in 2008, and I've been amazed by what you have been able to accomplish in just a few years. You are about to finish your Master of Social Work degree at the University of Texas and are doing some incredible work in the community and have become a really respected resource and person. In kind of looking at all that and knowing you personally as I do, I sometimes worry. However, and that you're driving yourself very hard, that you're trying to make up for lost time. I'm wondering if that's something you think you can do or if that's what's really happening?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I think I'm trying to reclaim my place in Austin, in this community. I've got away, was it said that there are no second acts in American life. I think I've got a couple, 2, 3. I think that I wasted the opportunities and the voice that I had last time with Raul when we were going into junior highs and doing poetry with youth in town. I think that I wasted the opportunity that I had to reach out and use my experiences with them. I think that the 17 years that I did in prison instilled in me such a sense of outsideness, otherness, alienation and angst that I've come out and I don't really relate that well to the people around me. I always feel like I'm not with them, that I'm not of them. The only thing that I can do is drive to get those initials after my name. Do the things that I think I need to do and use what I have used my history to try to reach out to these kids and if I'm not doing something, I feel like I should be doing something. I have a very difficult time relaxing now. Yeah, I relax too much in prison and I spent too many months, too many years lying up on the bed just reading crap. So yeah, I do drive. I do worry about it, but I mean, what's the alternative?Suzanne Mason:	It make sense. Do you feel like you're fitting in?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	With some places, yeah. I sometimes feel like come the token convict, like the organizations will trot me out and say, ""Look how liberal we are. We have a convict on our board."" Or we have a convict working for us, or we have this or whatever. But that's usually by administration, by the managerial people. The staff are usually the ones who say, ""Cool, c'mon, let's roll."" But it's likely other people, the ambitious ones and the ones who were trying to steer an organization, and giving direction, will be very likely to say, ""And Jorge has done this and Jorge did this and Jorge has done that, and we're so proud of him."" Like c'mon man. You don't have to say that. Let me just show it. But I've had times, I was with a group that school called the Social Justice Action Coalition.We went to Joplin over the summer. We went down there for disaster relief and we came back and we had a small reunion that was like 12 of us at outside of Fresco bar here in town. I remember sitting there and feeling like I wasn't obvious people, even though I'd spent three days with them in disaster relief, crying with them, picking up trash and picking [00:05:00] up bricks and finding all the detritus of lives that had been torn apart by this tornado in Joplin. We'd bonded really well, sitting there with them while they were laughing and giggling and drinking margaritas. I remember thinking in any other instance, you people wouldn't even have me here. I'm a different race. I'm a different age. I'm a different class. I'm a different culture. I'm not saying that's true, I'm saying that's the way you feel and that's a feeling that you'll never shake. It's not something that's just going to shed, that you're going to say, ""I feel accepted."" You feel accepted in certain cultural milieu, the East side or in prison. That's not to say again that you are not, but you can't shake that. It's a bit too much time.Suzanne Mason:	Yeah. You were arrested in 1991 right around thanksgiving?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Right.Suzanne Mason:	Spent a year in county jail and then went to the state penitentiary in '92. Tell me what happened? What did you find out from your family in 1993?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I had my brother named Charlie Carlos, who was also involved with UT in a lot of stuff. He was with the Chicano culture committee there. He was the writer, he was the entertainment writer for Arriba newspaper on the East side. I was writing sports for the statesman and copy editing. Charlie had these dreams of us doing a minority newspaper on the East side. I kept putting obstacles in the way, it's not too much money, you need all this stuff. I never really paid attention to that, I think. I never gave it credibility. Charlie was like the light of the family, era la luz, he was the one around whom everybody gathered. We all had like our niches. Anyway, he dies in '93, I like to say that he died of poverty because he was riding his bike and outside and it was really cold and wet and caught some pneumonia and one of his lungs collapsed because he didn't have the money to go on a hospital. So by that time, it was too late, so he died. That shot me into self-pity, and I kept thinking, well, that I'm the one who should've died. That I'm the one who kept going back to prison. So I started sniffing glue and they sent me for minimum custody to close custody.My daughter, who was like two at the time, my ex-wife had been bringing her to see me. She wrote me and said, ""I'm not bringing Catalina to see you because in close custody you don't have contact visit."" I don't want her visiting you through a wire. But she didn't understand and she said, ""I'll always tell her that you're a good man who's done bad things."" Which of course was crap. I mean, a good man doesn't get a pistol and put in people's faces and take the money. I took a good long look at myself, and I started reading a lot of philosophy and I adopted. I had been swimming in the seas of cultural relevancy and situational ethics.I believed that I was never going to get out of prison. I had a 60 year sentence and this is my third time down. So I said I need to get some sort of absolute philosophy, that non consequentialist, that says, I'm doing this because I think it's the right thing, not because it's going to do this for me because Kaye is going to love me or makeup for Charlie or my mother is going to love me or my community will have me back. But because this is the right thing to do. That whole series of events propelled me into becoming an activist in prison and a writer in prison. I started a book called Behind The Walls that they wanted me to go out and go to Charlie's funeral.Suzanne Mason:	Can we start over with that?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Okay.Suzanne Mason:	So maybe starting by telling us how did you find out Charlie died? Was it a letter?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	No. They called me to the chaplains office. If they ever call you to the chaplains office in prison, it's not a good thing, you know that. So they called me to the chaplains office and I had a phone call from Lisa. Lisa is my ex-wife, and she said Charlie's really sick, one of his lungs collapse, he's in a hospital and they don't think he's going to live. She said had been designated as the one to deal with him. So they put Katie on the phone, and Katie was maybe two years. She was like, ""Daddy, come home, come home."" She broke my heart. They called me the next day down there again, and she tells me Charlie died, and that they wanted me to come out to the funeral.I knew that TDCJ that their policy was [00:10:00] that no one with the aggravated crime that I had could go on further. I tried to tell them that, and I think they felt that I didn't know what I was talking about or that I didn't want to make the effort. They just did not give me the credence, which was in one sense they were like here's Jorge the oldest brother, the repository of all the knowledge in the family, but he's in prison and he was an addict, and we really can't believe him.So I decided, knowing as a journalist, the power of the written word. I had a current of an idea, if you had a book, would you believe that? I started taking notes and about what chapters I would want if I were out there and what would I want to explain to the families and friends and takes inmates to guide them to this institution. Because the administration, the entire system is monolithic. It's apathetic. They don't care about the families and friends of convicts. They care about perpetuating the system and keeping their job, and it's not a terrible thing to just the way it is. I think there was no way for these people to get that information. I started writing the book. It took me, I don't know that was note two I restarted note three. I remember I would sit on the toilet and I would write and I would write, and I would write. I went to two typewriters and I was looking up for some friends, sent me money to buy typewriters. I finished in a bout 98, I think. Then I started sending out sample chapters. You have to do the, I went back to writers market and they all this things that you have to send out in order to get a manuscript accepted. I sent out packets of five. In my third packet of five, I got two bytes to possibilities and finally I negotiated with the University of North Texas press and they accepted it.I remember sitting on my toilet crying thinking the sense of validation, that's something that I had done while in prison, was actually going to help somebody who's outside, who was in the situation of my mother or my family or whatever, they could pick up this book and they could see that, there was a way to this fog and morass of apathy and ignorance to their family. It was weird because I don't think my mother ever thought that it was actually going to get published. She died in 2000 and the book was finally published in 2002.I can't tell you how many dozens of letters I got when I was in prison they would find their way to me. Invariably there were women, talking about my father or my brother or my son, my husband, saying thank you for writing this book because I understand. Yeah, that was a one of the probably the most self-affirming validating thing that I've ever done because I put myself in a situation where the asters walking the hallway would turn sideways and our brush against me, you have that sense of depersonalization, dehumanization. Here I've done something where the people, in the free world could look at and some value. It was deeply affirming.Suzanne Mason:	What's is the name of the books.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	It's behind the walls. A guide to prison for the friends and families of texts, emails. I'm a hard time remembering the tile. I always do, yeah but this opportunity.Suzanne Mason:	Yeah. I think it's behind the walls. A guide for the friends.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	No a guide to the family and friends and takes prison inmates. That's what it is yeah. I'm sorry. I have a terrible time with that.Suzanne Mason:	When you are telling that there is a moment where you describe the feeling of validation. What is that feeling there? You seemed to have an emotion there.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	You can't help but buy into the notion that, I'm very aware of the societal forces that keep America's prisons full and building more. The institutional racism, the historical oppression which may can end with poverty in the condition to keep people in poverty in the school to prison pipeline. I'm well aware of those and they all have a lot of validity. That's okay the first time and now maybe not the second time. The third time you go to prison when the second time I got out, I was a respected professional in Austin. I was respected writer. I was an actor, I was a poet, and [00:15:00] to still do it. You have to ask yourself, what the hell is wrong with you? Are you sociopath? Are you psychopath. You have to feel a sense of self contempt, that you keep throwing things away. You keep struggling back to the starting line. It's like everyone else is here and there ahead of you. You keep circling back and you're at the study, Matt, again and again. It's like I'm so tired of this.Yeah, the validation comes from using the I mean people call them gifts. You're gifted writer. Well, I don't know that. I have no idea how much work it takes, but using the skills that you have and whatever the Lord has gifted you with, to do something that other people find valuable. Then instead of people thinking, yeah or you could have done this but, Jorge was a great poet but, Jorge was a really good sports writer but. Yeah, since validation is when you get a letter in a scroll hand remote from a woman in Spanish and it comes to you and it will just say hold, we know state prison until taxes. If no number nothing. It would finally get to me and she would say ""Mijo, muchas gracias por escribir este libro. Yo no sabía nada y nadie me decía nada de mi hijo."" To get that this woman took time to do that and no idea had the faith in the Lord that this little was going to get to me and just express what was on her heart. Yeah.Suzanne Mason:	Could you just translate into English what you just said in Spanish.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Much of that, I don't remember what I said.Suzanne Mason:	Dear son.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah. Thank you for reading this book because I had no way of finding out the things that were going on with my son who was in prison. Sorry, but yeah you get a sense of validation. What was weird was, I was getting a satisfaction from the guards, because they knew my history. I was headed to be [inaudible 00:17:02] a lot of them knew me and knew whom I was, and they knew i had to book. A lot of them would come ask me let me grab a copy of it. Let me see it. Strange, and I didn't get a sense from any of them but it was something that wasn't in any way wrong. That was that I was lying in it, that I was taking shut for system, even though I did in some instances, but that's okay. They got over it.Suzanne Mason:	In re-entering, as we now say, becoming reintegrated into society as a former prisoner, you've found I think a lot of inspiration from Chad Marunas thinking on the importance of giving back in community service. I've been really inspired by watching how well you've been able to connect with people and make friends and professional relationships and begin to find ways to use your skills as a writer and just as a person to help youths who are caught up in the juvenile justice system. I wonder if you could tell us about that, what that means to you?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I feel that but, one of the things that I think that my innate sense for whatever it was that when I was growing up with my mother. The sense of rejection is pretty well what's driven me into the things that I did, I think they were wrong. I don't know if I sense that with a lot of these youth. I sense that they feel that they are rejected, that they are alienated. I connect better with a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old than I do with a 35-year-old, I think in a lot of ways. Because a lot of ways I am very open about who I am and my history, and it's like I get tired of it sometimes. Other people tell me I know that with certainty there's a lot of people in this town who have contempt for me because of my history, some of the people like the statesman whatever.Suzanne Mason:	But don't you think that would be true in any event just simply because you committed robberies?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah, right. I'm [00:20:00] not saying that they shouldn't. What I'm saying is that I've been advised by some people, ""Just go be a CPA and quit dragging that history with you and quit putting it out and rubbing it in people's face."" But the only way I think that I can connect with these youth. The only way that I can go into prison reform work, the only way that I can say, in other words, I'm a trained journalists, I'm a good writer, I'm a keen observer, I'm an articulate reporter of things that are going on so in order to do that I have to say, ""This is who I am, and this is what gives me validity."" So I have to claim. I have to sit in the fact that I am an ex-convict. In order to do that, I have to be willing to accept this other stuff that goes with it, and I'm going to get that. Yet that sense of palpable alienation, that sense of otherness, that sense of I am not mainstream like I was telling you this poem I'm writing. That I am not mainstream, I am not the middling-piddling person who you were used to. I don't have to tell you that. I think they sense that.I'm very much a believer and it's hard not to believe in it, in the existence of the school to prison pipeline. Whether it exists in some sort of concrete, marble structure that's been erected to lock up all the minority or gay or other youth or whether it's just something that has come about as a result of people overreacting to certain situations in school or whatever, or fear. Shit exists, and you have to try to disrupt that at some point along the pipeline. What we've been doing with the group sending solidarity is we go into the prisons, and that's at the end of the pipeline. But there has to be some way to disrupt it earlier. I think I'm in a unique position to do that. I'm in a unique position to not only try to disrupt this pipeline with my credibility as a writer and as an ex-con, and as someone who gives off this vibe of, ""Hey, I am other and I'm like you in that sense."".I think that for myself, I have to do that. I have to continually see that I'm not doing stuff just for me, just to secure my future, just to do whatever it is. That the only way that Jorge stays sane, the only way that Jorge looks at himself with any approval or acceptance, and the only way I can find a little peace is to know that I am in fact using all these so many years, all these decades of being in that cell, being naked in those hard cells, being washed with that water hose, being dragged down that hallway and beaten by these guards. That I can use it and put that to some use because I put myself in there. By me putting myself in there, I abandoned my brother to death. I abandoned my mother. I abandoned my daughter. I had to find some way to say, ""That has to mean something. I have to find something good out of that"". The way that I do that is by going back and getting with these youth incarnate bads and using their words and their poetry to help them see, help them re-frame their history for themselves. To not buy into the notion that you are delinquent, that you are bad, and what you're doing sucks a bit, that you need to be put in this alphabet scope of I-S-S, O-S-S, J-A-A-E-P before it leads you to T-Y-C. That you don't have to take that route.Suzanne Mason:	So it's a seeking redemption.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah. No doubt. It's not so much I think that I seek it, I get it. I'm not going into it saying, ""How do I get redemption?"" I'm following that path that I began in 1893 that says if this is the right thing to do, this the thing that have to be done. As a consequence, I got parole. As a consequence, I became ex-con. As a consequence I became reconnected to my daughter. As a consequence, I've gained professional acceptance here in Austin. So yeah, I'm not seeking it, it's coming as a result of what you do.Suzanne Mason:	Yeah, that's great. That 13 or 14-year-old kid that you might help, is there some connection to who you were when you were 13 or 14?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I don't know if I was. I had a sense of otherness ever since I was about seven because of what happened with me and my mother.Suzanne Mason:	What happened?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	My mother was very quick to, bless her heart. She came from a culture and a society that was very quick to use violence to discipline. I was the oldest boy until she finally learned that that's not the way to do it and she lightened up with my younger brothers. But of course when you're six or seven years old, and your mom have you cornered up on the bed [00:25:00] and she is swinging this whip at you and she's telling, ""Get your hand away, this hurts me more than it hurts you."" Then you go into class and you cry and you think, ""What the hell did I do to deserve this?"" There's nothing you can do as a six or seven year old to deserve that. Nothing.So of course, you end up seeking affirmation from women as you grow up because you didn't get it from your mother and you feel that if they do give you affirmation, there has to be something wrong with them because you are not worthy of it so you go look for it from another woman and you seek that path. Then you end up getting things, wanting things to help you with that, material things. Cars, jewelry, nice clothes and you can't afford it so you go and you rob. That's a cycle I ended up isolating, thinking part of it was greed, part of it was the thrill of running with the money. All of that enters into the psyche of a robber. Anyway, ask that question again because I lost the thread.Suzanne Mason:	Yeah, I was just asking about that 13 or 14- year-old and you talked about.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	About sense of otherness, yeah. I've always since I was about eight, nine, 10, I thought there something wrong with me. Why would my mother do me the way she did? There has to be something wrong with me. Even though I was doing really well in school and whatever, I had the sense of sitting outside myself watching this person do well in school, and it wasn't me. I've never really felt a part of, except when I was playing sports, maybe then, or playing scrabble. But yeah, I think that I can sit down and talk with them and they sense I'm not patronizing, and I get really comfortable really quickly.Suzanne Mason:	Is there a story of interaction you've had with a kid recently that comes to mind?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah. We went into Fairmont high school back about two weeks ago. The first day of a three-month-long creative writing workshop, and these are youth. They're 13, 14, 15 and we walked in there, it was me and Sarah, and there were three boys, they were 13 or 14. Sarah started talking to one and I found out later he was a little deaf and I thought that he was just a little slow because he was speaking. But I'm not sure what was up with him. Sarah kind of backed away from him I'm not sure what vibe she was getting, and he went and he sat down, so I went and sat down next to him. I just started talking to him and listening to him and we ended up making up a pretty good connection. There was three youths there was another guy there named Randy, and he didn't say anything for like the first 20 minutes at all. While Sarah was going on with our thing about this is Sending Solidarity, and we had four words written on paper. We asked them what is education? What is this? What is that? When we got to what is disruption, I looked at Randy and I told Randy, ""Randy, what do you think disruption is?"" I'm forgetting exactly what the word he used I think he said making a scene or making noise or something.Suzanne Mason:	Nuisance.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	A nuisance, yeah. Making a nuisance. I said, ""That's right. That's great. I really love that."" and I said, ""That's what we do. That's what Sending Solidarity is. We make a nuisance of ourselves with TDCJ. We love people who disrupt. We love people who make nuisance of themselves. You can jump up right now and scream and yell and do what you want, and I'm going to love it."" He looks at me and he just like grants, and then my phone goes off I had my phone in my coat, and it's like everything stops and then we laugh and you see disrupting that's what we want, and for the rest of the session he came out of himself when he started writing and he drew some stuff. Afterward the counselor there, when we were debriefing, he comes up and said, ""Man, I've been with these kids almost a year, six months, eight months, "" and he said, ""Randy and the one you were talking to haven't said more than a few words all year.They've said more words today than I've ever seen them say.'' Whether it was me and Sarah, the combination, the way we were talking to them, the sense of otherness that I bring. I don't know but it's really validating, it's really cool to see youths like that come out of their shell and get something from the process. I think it's because we encourage their voice, and we've told them, ''this is what we see, but it doesn't have to be like this. If you don't like it there's no way we'll change it. We're not going to come in and tell you how we have to do it, what you have to do. We're not going to set standards for you. We'd really like you to participate, but more than anything, we want to hear your voice. How are you going to help us shape this? How are you going to help us with these structures so that we can be in here and talk to each other for the next three months?'' I don't know how much they get that [00:30:00] from other people.Suzanne Mason:	Just for the record, Sarah is just a colleague?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah. Sarah is a colleague at a group we have called Sending Solidarity. Sorry. She and I run workshops.Suzanne Mason:	I guess I've always wanted to ask, now that you're out, if you had any moment in that first year or so where you were really struck by something that you hadn't smelled, or tasted, or seen, or heard. Was there something that just washed over you suddenly and caught you off guard after having been behind bars all those years?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Sounds. Yeah, more than in sounds and sense of smells and the sounds of kids laughing. You don't do that much. You go to playgrounds and hear all these kids laughing and that's cool. The sound of the cars on a freeway at night. You're always way out the country, and you don't hear anything of that. That's some stuff. But more than anything, I miss touch. You were 17 years old and nobody touched you, nobody. Where the only thing you're getting are blows or kicks, or somebody pushing you out of the way. Who you don't get the touch of intimacy. That intimate touch of someone caressing your neck or rubbing your back or something like that. That's the biggest thing, and that's one of the things that I really find amazing. I used to not hug before I went in. Even my friends. I would see this el araso, the hug that Latinos give each other, and I was distant from that. Now I'm really quick to give someone a hug, if I even don't even know you that well, ""Come here, let me hug."" That's just the way we do it, that's the way I do it. I'm more free with that, and I would think that I would be not so free with that. I would think that that would be even further away from it, but I've gotten really close to it. But yeah I think I got out the first day and I step right back into it.I get really frustrated with electronic stuff sometimes. I will throw phones across the room and computer out the window and stuff like that. I still do, but one of the things I learned is you have to ask for help. Because otherwise what you do is you end up thinking, ""I'm so stupid. "" That leads very quickly to, "" I'm worthless,"" and that can lead very quickly into these gray areas of self hate and contempt. You have to say, ""look, I don't have the technological expertise to figure out how to take this phone off hold, so would you show me. "" You have to do stuff like that, because you can get lost.So yeah, you just miss life. You miss sitting down with four or five people and having a dialogue, and you miss sitting up to two, three in the morning. What's ugly about it is I miss prison sometimes. I miss the camaraderie of the handball court. I miss sometimes lying up in that bed, on the top bunk with a little night light on me. Knowing I don't have to get up in the morning. I can get when I want. I don't have to go eat, I have this peanut butter in my locker. I have some coffee in my locker. I can just sit here and read and not worry about a girlfriend, not worry about bills, not worry about where my next meal is coming from. It's that sense of, I have no responsibilities but to me and to my existence. That can be very alluring, very attractive. Doing that is actually cool, but I can do that here, I can lie in bed and read here. But knowing that I have to get up go to work, and I have to do all these other things. That can be very alluring, but what you forget is all the contempt and pain and anger and despair that's in between who I am now and that space then. You have to remember that.Suzanne Mason:	I'm not sure I understand that.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	That I would not being in that space. I would not mind being on that top bunk right now sometimes. Reading a book with that night light on me, eaten peanut butter and crackers. Not worrying about the pain that I've cause you, or the pain that I caused Mica or all this other stuff. For having to get up and go work at TCJC, or go work at the Civil Rights Project, and find a way to get down there, get on the bus and be in a cold, and ride the bike. But the thinking about the crime, the getting my parole revoke, the going back to prison, on the chain bus, the self contempt, and the hatred that goes in between is, I must say that's what stops me. Because I'm not going to do anything to go back anyway. But what I'm saying is you don't think about that. All you can do like [00:35:00] anything else, you idealize the situation, and you idealize being on that bunk without thinking about or contemplating everything that's in between. Does that makes sense?Suzanne Mason:	What it really means.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah.Suzanne Mason:	Yeah. Re-entry, I would imagine no easy for you. There's such a stigma to being an armed robber, a parolee, and -Jorge Antonio Renaud:	A felon.Suzanne Mason:	- a felon, and you're now about to embark on a career as a professional master of social work. Are there times when you still feel like you're facing some of those obstacles that former prisoners face now with how to find housing in the community?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Well, no. Because I haven't had to do that yet. Because I've lived with friends. Now I'm living in a group home, would sound like a nursing home or something. A commune so to speak. That the guy likes you and you sit down with the people and they accept you over dinner and you think, well, okay, you move in.Suzanne Mason:	Well -Jorge Antonio Renaud:	But the thing is no. The obstacles that most of the convicts have had, have to do with housing and employment, I have not really faced.Suzanne Mason:	Okay. So what I want to know then is who is someone who has been incredibly important to your re-entry? Someone that has played a part in helping you return in a way that has allowed you to really land on your feet.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	You of course. Maria Lee Moon, who offered me a space in her home. Back when I was in prison, Sharon Kaelyn who was a TCJ official who retired and offered me a place on a ranch in Leno.Suzanne Mason:	Tell me about Sharon.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Well, we don't have much time to talk about Sharon. We have like three minutes left. She was the highest ranking woman in TCJ at the time when she asked me to come work as editor of the Echo. She was from Texas, but a liberal. She went to run part of the New York prisons, and Richards brought her back to work over in Texas.FEMALE_1:	For the record what's TJ -Suzanne Mason:	TDCJ is the?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Texas Department of Criminal JusticeSuzanne Mason:	The prison system?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah. The state prison system.Suzanne Mason:	If there's a few things like that that you might want him to.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Take civil rights project, TCJC, Texas Criminal Justice Coalition. I'm sorry, the acronym though. Yeah, and Sharon Kaelyn ended up becoming a very good friend and she retired. She offered me a home. When was up for parole, she went ahead and wrote a letter to the parole board for me and said that, ""I would welcome this man into my home, if you let him go. She got me a job in construction in Leno she let live on her cattle ranch for as long as I wanted, but then I moved back to Austin. Those people have been very important, you've been very important. My family, even though they were not that much of a support while I was in prison, especially my brother Steven has been very much by my side, very much willing to help me and assist me in whatever way he can, he and his family. My daughter who to her willingness to set me back into her life and to her willingness take me and introduced me to her friends as my dad, ""I wan't you to meet my dad,"" has meant a lot.But the community, the professional acceptance has been good. The getting into UT graduate school, school of Social Work, the acceptance there from people who are less than half my age. It's been really great. The people who see me just know the student, but one is a little more eloquent, maybe who is more experienced, whose more articulate, who's lived a lot of the things that they're trying to get rid of. So all of that gives me a sense of validation and acceptance. But I don't think I'll ever shake this feeling of being outside myself, watching go on of other that there's something different about me that makes me not want to be or that I will never be included into your group, really totally. I don't know what group I would be included into, except it was a group of ex-cons or something. I don't know.Suzanne Mason:	Is there anything you would say to your mom right now?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	A few years ago, that question would have slayed me. That really I just miss you though. [00:40:00] Forgive me for the pain I've cause you. Thank you for visiting me all those years in prison and nobody else did. Then allowed me to work to that sense of I see you as my oppressor too, I understood that you were a great, gracious, loving person who was a product of a times in our era, I was being emotionally abused, not physically abused, but emotionally abused by my father and with raising all these children and had no real way of knowing how to deal with me with a bright, energetic probably ADA. I don't know whatever acronyms you use now, young boy and use what was in our arsenal and didn't do it to hurt me and got no pleasure from it. We came to reportion before she died. Bless her heart. Then I would just know, I would just give her a note I saw and go and drink some beer. Would be fine, she'd be really proud of Katie.Suzanne Mason:	What is your mother's name?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Marina.Suzanne Mason:	You mentioned how your book was published in 2002, after she died. Did she read your book?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I don't know. I had set a manuscript. Steven was taping it for me sometimes after I ran out of money in prison. He may have liter seen the manuscript, but I don't know. I know my mother was at that time was drinking pretty heavily. So I don't know if she read it. I have no sense of it. I think that my mother was just, I won't say she gave up on me. I was thinking she was taking things that I told her with a grain of salt. So I don't know.Suzanne Mason:	Then also for the record, how long were you in prison? You had for 16?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Seventeen years.Suzanne Mason:	Seventeen years?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Yeah.Suzanne Mason:	You went in in what year?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	In 1991, I was arrested and I was released in 2008.Suzanne Mason:	Then can you talk a little about why it is that you got arrested?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I was arrested for armed robbery, here in Austin.FEMALE_1:	It was not the first time he'd been in prison.Suzanne Mason:	You talked about at the very beginning, talked about Raul, can you just talk a little bit about that relationship?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	I started writing poetry seriously in the mid 80s. I was just writing it for me as a of a self-medication. I decided finally to try to publish. I ended up sending some poetry out to a place called [inaudible 00:43:09] , which was put out by the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center in San Antonio. They were doing a series called, ""Pinto Art"" or a special on, ""Pinto writing"" or something. I got the publication back where they had given me the entire center spread, the poetry of Antonio.Sandro Cisneros was a writer in San Antonio. Was the curator I think with the cultural art of the director. Raul was a special guest editor flourishing. So he wrote me and he said, that I was from Austin, and look, when you get out, come see me. I got out, I went to see him and he had opened up a bookstore, his six color register bookstore. We became good friends in the mentor protege type relation because he had also been in prison and with a poet and had become radicalized and had used poetry as a way to reach youth. He knew that I had that sensibility and he wanted to use me for that also. He wanted to encourage that in me as a way of rehabilitation and reformation. We became good friends and I would read poetry for him at his bookstore. He ended up getting me a city of the Austin grant to write a book, to put the policy book of poetry.We had a fundraiser and raised money and matched the matching funds and I ended up using the money for cocaine and I went back to prison. While I was gone, he died in 2008 just before I got out. Since then, a lot of what I do have become very heavily involved with resistencia and save our youth, which is the organization that's under radius density that goes into local juvenile justice institutions and uses creative writing as a way to reach you. One, because I love [00:45:00] that work and I think it's part of what I need to be doing. But too as a way to pay homage to Raul to continue with the work that he had done.Suzanne Mason:	Just to get his full name, it's Raul?Jorge Antonio Renaud:	Raul or Salinas.Suzanne Mason:	Well, thank you for doing this.FEMALE_1:	Thank you.Jorge Antonio Renaud:	You are welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
mby008897,"Minerva Marinosci:	[00:00:00] I'm Minerva Marinosci. I'm 41 years old. Today is January the 30th, 2012. We are here in Austin, Texas. I met Aurelia Garcia Cortes at an interfaith meeting over 15 years ago.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	My name is Aurelia Garcia Cortes. I am 61 years old. Today's January the 30th, 2012. We're here at the Bullock Museum in Austin, Texas. I met Minerva over 15 years ago through Our Lady of Guadalupe, cause we were both parishioners at the church, and we were both involved in the beginnings of Austin interfaith back then. Well, Minerva, thanks so much for coming out on this balmy morning or afternoon, but I'm just delighted that you're going to give us some time here. I wanted to have this interview because I know you're so involved in, and been very involved for a long time. But before we go into that, I wanted to ask you, where were you born Minerva? Where are you from originally?Minerva Marinosci:	I was born and raised in Laredo, Texas. I was there for 18 years, I realized I still have not lived anywhere as long as I did in Laredo. To this day, that's still the place of where I live the longest.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	For the record, where's Laredo, Texas?Minerva Marinosci:	Laredo is a border town with Nuevo Laredo which is on the Mexican US border.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	What was it like growing up there?Minerva Marinosci:	It was an interesting upbringing. I was very fortunate, I had my parents and my extended family. I grew up within a five-mile radius of all my aunts and uncles and cousins, and so we saw each other very often. But I grew up in one of the poor parts of Laredo. For people who know Austin, who may not known Laredo, it reminded me a lot of Montopolis, when I went to Montopolis the first time. Because you have to go over a bridge, it's disconnected, it's not very connected to the rest of the city. So because of that, it's forgotten. So it's not where people went after dark, it's not where people necessarily thought would be a good place to raise their family. But my father found a house that we could afford, and so we moved from when we were renting for downtown Laredo, lower house we rented whereby the railroad tracks. He found this house, and so he moved my mother and I, and my brother and my sister then came along after that. So that's where I grew up. Interestingly then, my uncle moved and then my aunts moved, and so we build this community in this neighborhood where for some people maybe the undesirable area, but for us, that's where we grew up.Speaker 3:	Again, what was the name of the neighborhood?The neighborhood is Santo Nino neighborhood.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Santo Nino. Did you go to a public school there?Minerva Marinosci:	I did. My elementary school was, Santo Nino elementary school. It's interesting because when I first heard it... I didn't go to that school. I was transferred to another school because that school was getting fixed or repaired or something, and so my teacher and our classmates went to Ryan elementary school for like three or four months until the school was, I just remembered that, and then we all came back, and that's where from then on I stayed in that whole Santo Nino elementary school, and then Seattle middle school, and Seattle high school. Those two schools were brand new, they opened up when I was there. I had gone to Lamar junior high, and they opened up these schools. People used to say, ""Why are they building them that school? They'll be burned down in a year, they'll tear it apart, because those people don't care about education, those people are not necessarily worthy of our tax dollars."" There was a real sense of pride that the principals had, that they were going to prove to the community that those people did care about education, and that those people were going to respect their schools, and it used to be impeccable. There was no graffiti the whole time that I was there because people had such pride. As a matter of fact, my uncle helped built that's cool because he used to be a bricklayer and so he'll say, ""That wall I helped make, and that wall I helped make."" So there's a lot of history in those schools for me.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	I know Laredo doesn't have a whole lot of colleges out there. When you are going to school, did you have a sense that you would be going to college? What was your thinking back then?Minerva Marinosci:	I was very fortunate. When I went to junior high, they had just started the GT program at our school, and I was able to get in.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	The GT program being the?Minerva Marinosci:	The Gifted and Talented [00:05:00] program. It was just starting at that point. It was back in the early eighties, and I got in. I got in because of my mother's real foresight. I went in and they said, ""Well, she's at the border, so she could either go to regular classes or she could try this new program we have."" My mother said, "" What is this program?"" She said, ""Well, it's a little bit more difficult, and so we need to make sure that you approve that she goes into these classes. My mother said, ""Well, what happens if she doesn't make it."" ""So well, she will just go back to the regular classes."" She said, ""Well, there's no hurt in trying, so let her try."" All of a sudden I became very smart. People thought I was going to go to college, and people thought I could do well, at least teachers, and I was treated accordingly. I was surrounded by a lot of other students who were treated accordingly in that way.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Was this middle school or junior high?Minerva Marinosci:	This was junior high. This was my seventh grade. Well, at the time you used to go to sixth grade in elementary school and then seventh and eighth was junior high. So I went to seventh grade at Lamar junior high, and that's when I got into this group of students and with teachers who just said, ""Well, this is the group that's going to go on to college."" So that I did. That was the path, and my parents were very much for them. Education was for them very important, and they had very high expectations, and I had to do well. So when I got to high school, they were then worried where are we going to go? People started talking about where we're going to go. I got into the University of Texas, and I got into Incarnate Word. Incarnate Word offered me a full academic scholarship, and so I thought, ""Smaller, closer to home.""Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Incarnate Word is where?Minerva Marinosci:	In San Antonio. So I went there and it was a great match for me.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	You went there for four years.Minerva Marinosci:	I went there for four years and I finished school.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Where did you go from there, did you go back home?Minerva Marinosci:	I always said I will go back home, but I got a job in Austin.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Doing what?Minerva Marinosci:	I got a job in Austin. I used to work for the legislature. I had done a class with a teacher who at the time was a state representative. So when he became a Senator, he expanded his staff, and so I had been one of the students had done well. I applied for the job and I got a position to be one of his legislative aids. I also wanted to go to grad school, and so I thought that was always going to be a temporary job, because I wanted one, the legislature is only here, every other year. But also my plans were to go to grad school, and I got into the LBJ School. So I worked part-time, this is where we met Aurelia, is because I started going to Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. One of my friends from college said, ""Minerva you're moving to Austin, you have to go to Our Lady of Guadalupe. There was a priest there, Father Bill, and you will love him. I had taken a lot of peaces and justice courses at Incarnate Word, and had learned a lot about how the Roman Catholic Church had been very active in issues of justice and working with the poor. So she said, ""You'll love that Church, you'll love that church."" So I went and that's where I got to our Our Lady of Guadalupe, and there were members of Austin interfaith. My whole world really became a very different place for me, because the things I had learned about in college was actually something that I could actually apply through my congregation and that was [inaudible 00:08:43]Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	When you were student at Incarnate word, did you know the organization Cops, which is a sister organization to Austin Interfaith. Was it around then? Did you know about it?Minerva Marinosci:	Being a typical college student, very isolated, stayed within the boundaries of the campus, didn't venture into the local world. I hope that's not typical anymore, but that was my experience, could stay very insulated into the campus world. But when I got to Austin, I was really looking for something to do besides my work and then when I got to school. It was through my church that I really found what I was looking for, which was a sense of building community and being a part of doing something different in the world. So I thought I would find that at the legislative session. That was not where it was. I thought it would be when I went to the LBJ's, with a whole bunch of people who were supposed to be active and involved, I didn't find it there, I found it in my church. It's where I found that through the organization of Austin Interfaith that you could be a citizen, [00:10:00] you could live out your faith in a way that impacted other people's lives than your own.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	What particularly about the work were you're attracted to? Because in Austin there's a lot of advocacy organizations everywhere.Minerva Marinosci:	The gospel talks about how we're supposed to act in a particular way or how the world is for everybody, and everybody should live in dignity and everybody should be respected. The organization was not just about charity and giving to people. I grew up poor, but there was dignity in being poor. My father worked, my mother take care of our family, my aunts and uncles all worked very hard. So it wasn't that we wanted somebody to just give us something, but there was a sense of dignity and respect that was missing in the conditions of our neighborhood. So being part of a congregation that really believed that the people themselves could figure out, and them being a part of an organization that taught us the skills of how to actually do it. Because we can't just say to somebody, well go do something and never teach them how to do it. That was what was exciting to me. My first interaction was at a school, at Zavala Elementary School, and I know you were very involved at the time, and that's why sometimes that we met was I did a translation. I am fluent in both languages, and so I was asked would you go translate for parents who are learning this training sessions? I thought, well, sure I can do that. I was 23 years old. I didn't have children. I didn't have particular great issues that I particularly wanted to resolve, but I was curious about this. So I went and at Zavala, I saw a lot of men and women, a lot more women than men, moms who were there to learn about how to advocate for their children. I thought this is what was missing in my time. This is what was missing back in... If my mother had known about this, she would've advocated in a very different way. She did all the traditional things. She made sure we got home, and at the end of the day my schooling wasn't very good. I struggled really hard when I got to college. That was just so attractive that people could learn how to be really at the table and say, this is what we want my children to learn, this is how we would like for them to learn it. Are you preparing them? We want them to go to college. Is this couldn't be good enough?"" Having people that look just like my mother, and my aunts asking those very tough questions and also saying, how do we make this happen? How can we make this happen? Was very exciting.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	I know when you work with the legislature obviously the word power doesn't scare when you're in the legislature. That's a word that you know, but I know that in a lot of these trainings, the word power scares a lot of people. How do you feel about that?Minerva Marinosci:	Well, I don't think I learned to be unafraid of the word power in the legislature. I think I learned how to be unafraid of that power working with Austin Interfaith. Power wasn't necessarily something that was good in my community. It was abused, the mayor had stolen millions of dollars. There's not a very good history in that area though, unfortunately. Things have really changed for better. But at the time, unaware until I went to college and started reading all about these things that had happened in my community, and how it kept people from being able to acquire resources, and things like that. I particularly thought that was something, but I do want to feel like I could do something, I wanted to be able to change. The definition of that word was explained to me in one of those training sessions in a way that that though, oh, I'm not afraid of it. It's not a bad, and it's not good either. It's neutral. It's what you do with it, it's this capacity to do. I'm like, ""Wow, that's what I want. I want capacity to do something."" When I first started going to Interfaith, I thought I want to take this back to Laredo. There was just always draw it to go back home. You meet somebody, you get married and here I am, so many years later I'm still in Austin, and I've made home and my parents are now here. So probably going to lie to them, it's not something that happened. But there was always this yearning [00:15:00] of that experience that I had in Laredo, and the experience my family had and how then that becomes a real foundation for how I act here in Austin.Speaker 3:	You wanted to take it back to Laredo? What did you want to take?Minerva Marinosci:	I wanted to be able to go back to Laredo and help organize people in Laredo and be somebody who could gather people together and hold elected officials accountable and things like that. That's what I mean.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	You wanted to build the organization.Minerva Marinosci:	Take this back. I realized that as a person individually, that really it was an organization that needed to start, not just one person learning some skills here and then going home. I've been very aware. So that's what I like about the network is that there's local organizations working on local issues and identifying local leaders to address their concerns.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	One of the things that I'm curious to know is, do you remember some of those first actions where you saw power in action?Minerva Marinosci:	I'll never forget the first time.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Tell me about that.Minerva Marinosci:	I was working at the legislature. So I would see from the floor, the senators talking to each other, and debating each other, and things like that. Senator (inaudible) at the time was on very key committees and had been there for a very long time. It had a very strong presence at the Senate and people really deferred to him because he had earned all that. He was very respected in all that. I'm in this church, at a Baptist church in East Austin, and it is full of people of all colors, just across the board, very diverse room filled with people. On the stage, you may have been on the stage, I don't know, but I do know Ofelia was on the stage. There are people on the stage and there's Senator Barretos. I didn't realize he was going to be here because the priest asked us to go to this accountability session and he was to talk about education and funding for the Alliance Schools way back when the first ones, when they were started for asking for state funding. I'll never forget he got up, they had asked him a question, ""Will you support funding for Alliance schools and we'd like a yes or no answer?"" In the back of my head, I thought there's no way, the man cannot say yes or no. He's going to give a speech. That's what he does. He gets up and he says, ""Yes, ma'am, I will, and ""Yes"" to these questions,"" and he sat down. I thought, ""How?"" How did these women do this? How did they do this and how is this respect that he has towards these leaders. I was like, ""Now that's what I want."" It was so attractive to me and I was just so proud to be part of this event. I didn't at the time. I wouldn't have said I was supposed be a leader, it was my first time, but I knew that this is something I want to learn more about. It was very very exciting.Speaker 3:	I [inaudible 00:18:13] to clarify, what was the event?Minerva Marinosci:	It was an accountability session and Austin Interfaith had done a number of those before, I'm sure and has done when just about every time there's an election, we invite candidates who are running for either city council or school board or state office and invite them and we talk about our agenda of issues, things that are important to our community, and we come up with some questions that we asked them: will they support these issues and that's what it was. It was an accountability session at the time.Speaker 3:	What did you do? What role did you play at that time?Minerva Marinosci:	That very first meeting I was a part of my church, I was part of the delegation for Our Lady of Guadalupe. I used to be a member of Our Lady of Guadalupe at the time. That's what you were invited to come in and listen to learn about where different candidates stand on the issues and so I was a participant.Speaker 3:	Just to clarify again, what is Austin Interfaith?Minerva Marinosci:	Austin Interfaith is a non-profit political organization that is made up of congregations and schools and unions. The role of the organization is to identify and develop leaders within those institutions. That way, they can develop enough power to be able to address the concerns that affect their families and their institutions. We currently have 33 institutions and are working on broad issues. It's broad-based, so there's lots of issues; Education, immigration, health care, living wages, and housing are some of the bigger issues that we're working on currently. But that agenda evolves and changes as people have conversations like [00:20:00] we're having about what's important to us, what we care about and through those conversations, issues arise.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	I want to go back also because I know you talked about priority schools. Can you tell me a little bit about the priority schools and why was that such an important issue.Minerva Marinosci:	At the time, there were schools who had very high needs campuses and they called them priorities so they would give them an additional dollars. These schools were at risk of losing money and when I became involved with the organization, they had gotten recommitment from the school district to keep that extra funding. But the organization was starting to think about, what do we do with that extra dollar? How do we use it? How is it used in a way that's more effective for the students?Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Just again, for the record, going even further than them being priority schools, am I right, were these the original schools that were involved in the segregation lawsuit?Minerva Marinosci:	That was probably before my time.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Okay.Minerva Marinosci:	When I came in, I came in '93 and by that time they probably weren't.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	These were the original schools that had been traditionally underfunded because of racial segregation. The court order required that the school district put in more money into the schools and so every year the school's would automatically just pump in more money until finally, when you came around it got to the point where we're not going to fund this anymore.Minerva Marinosci:	Right and that fight had just been won right before I got here and so because there had been that fight and they had had to really rethink about what was it to be a priority school? Was it just a school that got extra dollars? I think that probably Ofelia and a couple of other people would remember that much clearly. But when I got in, there were starting to work together to see how is teaching and learning happening in their school? Where's the involvement?Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	To go beyond just the draining end money into.Minerva Marinosci:	Right and so that is when I was the I was really fortunate to be part of the beginnings and I know you were very active at Savile and bringing in and working with Savile parents, just say, would you be willing to be in a partnership with the organization and learn some skills? I came in when there were about four or five schools that were starting to gather regularly for training sessions and talk about things that were important to them.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Do you remember some of those accomplishments in terms the jobs, after school programs. Were you around then?Minerva Marinosci:	It's interesting because I was part of the conversations and there we're starting to do something around the youth charter and working with youth and those were lessons learned because part of the things that the Alliance Schools were starting to do was work on after school programs and summer youth employment. They were trying to be much more holistic about that. But to this day, I just think back of all the work that the Alliance Schools and finding all these parents and leaders in the community that really talked about what were important to their families and out of those things came after school programs, the young scientists programs that they had, which they had six graders in their elementary schools. Their capital idea was born out of that. Some very good work came out of all the house meetings and workings and training sessions that were done back in the early nineties that we continue to build from those today.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Let's fast-forward now, in terms of the work that you do now, I know that you are a key leader in Austin Interfaith. Tell me about that?Minerva Marinosci:	Well, I left Austin to be an organizer. I was very fortunate to be able to do this full time and be an organizer in Dallas and then in St Antonio, which then I got to know cops very well. After being in San Antonio, and not knowing cops, and then coming back, and really getting to know and work with people that wasn't very fun. When I came back to Austin after a couple of years because I've got married, and had my first child. I stepped back, took a long-term maternity leave. But because my life had really been impacted by this work that was something that couldn't just not do again or do anymore and particularly more because my children were going to get older. What kind of community, were are they going to live in? So Samuel was born in 2003, and [00:25:00] within a couple of months I started going to meetings as a leader again and really starting to work very slowly, getting back into figuring out where I was going to do. But now that both of my children are at Travis Heights Elementary School and they're a kindergartener and a third grader school when education is becoming very, very important. So that is something that I work on the most closely with and making sure that the school is a place where children get to learn and teachers feel like they're teaching and learning. It's not just a testing machine. It's not just about testing they are not just worried about what score are they going to have at the end of the course? So that kindergarten and first grade are just as important as third, fourth, fifth, and that we don't wait until fifth grade to do some of the foundations. Those are the things that I've been really working on, because I want to make sure my children get the best education they can and certainly a much better one than I did. But one of the things that I always think about is even though may or may have been things that were missing, that may have not read all these fancy books and all those things. When I was in school, they taught me how to learn and they taught me to love to learn. In college, even though I didn't know some of the things, I wasn't afraid to learn it and I wasn't afraid to stay up a couple of hours longer and read more or to study harder because that was something that was very instilled in me, that you worked hard and you could learn it and you could figure it out. So that was something that I'd loved from my public schools that I want to make sure somewhere and I was seeing that with because no matter what we teach them today or how good, what information we can provide them. There's going to be something else to learn and who knows what kind of careers or opportunities that they'll have and those things they're going to have to learn. I want to make sure that they have this love of learning, that they're always hungering to learn more. Instead of feeling that, that's gets schools at that curiosity and that love of learning that every child is born with gets much too far.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	But you get to see that lot closer nowadays because you are involved.Minerva Marinosci:	Well, as I see that we mean with my children?Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Yes, and in the classroom-.Minerva Marinosci:	Yes class and in the classroom. So I get two participate in the classroom again. But again, working with parents and teachers to ask those questions that I learned back when I didn't have children. I saw these parents asking these questions with each other and asking these questions of the school and with the school. So that's something that I enjoy. That's why for me, Travis Heights is a very special place, is because there is that space to engage with the principal, to engage with the teachers and say, why are we doing this? Is this the best way? What are we trying to get? What are we trying to accomplish in this? Is this homework the most appropriate? Is this classwork the most interesting? If not, what do we need to support you to make sure that you have the space to do what you need to do. Because what we're finding is that it's not that teachers don't want to teach, is that there's a very limited space sometimes for them to do the work that they want to do and that they love to do.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	But for all practical purposes, I mean you have a master's degree in Public Policy. I mean, someone as young and as attractive and as smart as you could be in policy work somewhere. Yet you choose this other work.Minerva Marinosci:	Well, I think one of the things I was very fortunate to have come when I was very young. To meet a lot of very talented, gifted people that culturally would not be thought of as somebody to contribute because they didn't have education because... or formal education or because they didn't have a degree. What that experience taught me is that even though I may have had a degree that I didn't have all the answers. Even though I may have studied with some very prestigious people at school that there were people who lived in the communities who had as much talent, as much expertise, and certainly more expertise when it came to their neighborhoods and to their communities. That experience for me to really respect that and to understand that that local knowledge is vital for good policy. So for me it's that good policy is not just the research that one does from afar ,and from books or from surveys or whatever scientific methods are [00:30:00] used to collect data. But that good policy is when that is taken into account that study in that research together with this engagement of people who have the local knowledge. You'll find reforms after reforms after reforms that fail because they weren't owned or developed or created by the people that it was going to be impacting the most. That lesson very early on, right after while I was getting my degree and right after I got my degree. Having that experience really shaped me to really understand and value that, that's key to good policy. Yes I think we to do policy. I think I am part of a Policy Research Team and a Policy Consortium called Austin Interfaith. We create policy and we then build enough power to implement it and to make sure that it gets carried out in the way that it needs to get into community. So in many ways I feel like I am.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	So you're combining your faith tradition with government, with your involvement as a citizen in the shaping of policy?Minerva Marinosci:	I am very fortunate and I think that the more I think about my opportunity to be a citizen on a day-to-day basis, how much I want that for other people. That people should have the time and the space to have this joy of citizenship that now is getting harder and harder for people to participate because they're working two or three jobs. They've got their children to take care of. Their neighborhoods are not as safe as they need to be and so finding the talent that's out there and working with people and continuing to developing myself and developing others is I think what's going to really be. What it does. What I believe is the kingdom of God, that that's what we're all called to do, is to shape that kingdom and to make that true here and not just wait until we die, it's too late then I don't want to wait that long.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	In the meanwhile it's a lot of hard work.Minerva Marinosci:	That's right.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	A lot of good workMinerva Marinosci:	Very joyful work and meet lots of very interesting people and that feeds me. I hope that I also model that for my children because part of what I want my children to be is also good citizens and people who really are taking on that tradition of making a place better than what they found it.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Was it Samuel who described when he was asked what your mother does. What was his description of you?Minerva Marinosci:	When they ask what does your mother do? She goes and gets the vote out.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	So they get it?Minerva Marinosci:	When something when you think they haven't gotten it? It comes across and you find those great moments we like, they're getting that. This is an important thing for them too.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	That's great. Thank you so much. It's a great interview.Minerva Marinosci:	Thank you.Speaker 3:	Describe who Samuel is?Minerva Marinosci:	Samuel is my oldest son.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Your oldest son?Speaker 3:	How old is he?Minerva Marinosci:	He is 8 years old. He'll be 9 in April.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	For the record, Samuel and-Minerva Marinosci:	Augustin.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	Augustin always come to our get out the vote rallies and our meetings and our walks around there, just great troopers including walking in the middle of the heat in July 2010. Okay Minerva. Thank you so much.Minerva Marinosci:	Thank you. This was fun.Speaker 3:	Minerva, one more minute and i was curious [inaudible 00:33:47] just the following question. What is it in the work that you've done together? What is it that you most admired about one another?Minerva Marinosci:	What I admire about Minerva is she's not shy of meeting with whether it's a superintendent or the mayor of the city picking up the phone and making appointments and demanding to be heard. There's a real skilled involved in that and Minerva does it very well.Aurelia Garcia Cortes:	For me what i like is real role model and just her passion and her tenacity. I'd like to be able to be as patient and forthright for as long as she has because that's something that it's hard to do to just to stay at it. That passion that burns inside her is something that I want to hope that will burn inside me for a very, very long time.Minerva Marinosci:	It's burning in you. I can see it. Thank you Minerva.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today is February 12th, 2012 in Mesilla, New Mexico. I am my father's daughter. Dad, I know I've heard stories our family came from Mexico. What part of Mexico do we come from?Felix Arenas:	The family, the Arenas side, my father's side, came from Durango, Durango, from the great state of Durango. Durango is the place where a lot of the Westerns from the 1960s and the '70s were shot in the state of Durango in Mexico. The Menozas , from my mother's family, also came from Durango. All my grandparents were born around the turn of the century, around 1900. The Menozas came to Ciudad Juarez, which is right across the border from El Paso, Texas. They came to Juarez at about the 1920s. The Arenas came about 1950s.Olivia Arenas:	How much do you know about our grandparents?Felix Arenas:	Our grandparents were fantastic people. On the Arenas side, my abuelita Carmen was a strong, religious, quiet woman who married my abuelito Catarino Arenas. My abuelita Carmen was quiet, very strong, and very stern. In fact, they call you Carmelita because everybody says that you're a lot like my grandma. Not stern as she was, but very quiet, and it's amazing how alike you are. You were tiny when she passed away. Well, you were one-year-old when she passed away. It's amazing the way you sit on the chair or at the sofa, how you sit just like her with leaning into your knees, and when you are listening to people, it's amazing how you look just like your grandma Carmen that your cheeks, your mouth, how you speak with people, and how quiet you are. It's amazing to all my cousins how alike you are your abuelita Carmen.Felix Arenas:	Well, she married your abuelito Catarino. He was a well-known law man in Durango. As a young man, he rode with the Rurales, which was the mounted police in Mexico, which guarded the countryside in Mexico in the early 1900s. There's a story that he was well-known in the city of Durango and so was his horse. The story goes that when abuelito Catarino would celebrate a little too much, as young men usually do, his friends would just throw him across the back of his horse and the horse would take him home. His horse knew the way home. Later on, when he had a family, he didn't want to go out anymore on long expeditions to the countryside, so he got assigned as a guard at the local prison in Durango. Well, abuelito [00:05:00] Catarino got a little too comfortable there. One night he fell asleep, probably he fell asleep a few of the nights before, but on this one night some prisoners escaped. In the morning when they found out that the prisoners had escaped, my abuelito was charged with helping those prisoners escape, and he was jailed himself.Olivia Arenas:	Oh, no.Felix Arenas:	Now, back then, prisons in Mexico were cold and humid places. There were no beds or blankets or anything like that. My grandmother Carmen told my mom that my abuelito Catarino caught pneumonia while in prison and he died. Very ironic. But life in Durango back then was hard, and my abuelita Carmen and her two sons and her daughter made their way to Juarez in 1950s. Now, on my mother's side, my abuelito Perfecto had gotten to Juarez in the 1920s and he had started to working in the US in El Paso. It was a lot easier to come and work in the US at that time. But he was a young single man, so he went back to Nazas, Durango to look for that strong young woman he knew back then. She was raising her six brothers, and her sisters, and some other cousins because they had all lost their parents, and we don't know how. But when abuelito Perfecto went back to ask her for her hand in marriage, she told him he would have to accept the whole family, all the brothers, and sisters, and the cousins.Olivia Arenas:	That's a big family.Felix Arenas:	That's a big family. Yeah. He did accept everybody and he brought everybody to Juarez. He bought some land near the border crossing, he built a house, and then he provided for all of them. He worked in the steel foundries in El Paso all his life. My mother says that as a young girl, she remembers him getting up very early in the morning, every morning, because he had to cross the river and cross the bridge into the US. Then he'd have to walk miles to get to the foundry, and then when he got there, he worked a full day along all those hot molted metals, and then at night, he walked back and usually got home late after dark. My abuelito Perfecto never had an automobile, or a horse, or a carriage.Olivia Arenas:	I've heard you and my tios and my tias talk about growing up in grandma Catalina's house. Tell me about that house.Felix Arenas:	Oh my goodness. That was a magical place, my grandma's house. That's why everybody talks about it with big smile. My abuelita's house was, actually the property stretched from one side of the block to the other. On one side was my grandma's house, and on the other side, they had some rooms that they rented out, that my grandma rented out. In the middle, there was this big garden and in that garden, my grandma planted and raised pumpkins, and cantaloupes, and peaches, and all kinds of herbs, and some corn. Beside the garden there, she had a chicken coop and in that chicken coop, she one time, a few years I remember she raised a pig or two. So there was always stuff going on there at the house.Felix Arenas:	The holidays were always magical because [00:10:00] there was times, or birthdays, even birthdays or baptismals, or weddings were always great because everybody got together, and I mean, everybody, not just our family, but we always had lots and lots of visitors to the house. Like in weddings or any other celebration, grandma would go out the kitchen and go into the chicken coop and get a chicken or two, or a turkey. Sometimes even turkeys back there .Olivia Arenas:	Wow, turkey.Felix Arenas:	She would grab them and chop their heads off right there in the patio and the chickens would run around with their heads cut off. We always knew what was happening, what was coming up. So we let the little ones be out there in the patio when the chickens would be killed, and when they would see the chickens running around without their heads, everybody would be screaming. All the little cousins would be screaming, but it was just our fun. That house was just great.Olivia Arenas:	What parts of the house do you remember the most?Felix Arenas:	Well, the busiest part was always the kitchen, and there was always something brewing there. There was always lot of cooking. The house had six rooms, but because there was always a lot of people at the house and the family from the interior of Mexico coming and staying for a few weeks or months, the whole house was used. It was well-used. There was the patio where we all played. I mean, there was dozens of cousins always playing around. There was the pila, and the pila was a little cement pool. It's more like a small fountain or a water trough. It held the water that was used to irrigate the garden, but while my grandma filled the pila up in the summertime, all us little cousins would jump into the pila and that was our swimming pool. Your tio Nacho says that he learned how to swim in this little pila. Actually, a pila was no more than three feet across and three feet the other way.Olivia Arenas:	Wow, that's small.Felix Arenas:	So it was a little, but because we were little back then, it just seemed like an ocean to us. It seemed like a big swimming pool. Your tio Nacho says that we used to take dives, dive into the pila and stuff. But actually, it was wonderful because all my cousins were there and we'd jump in and out of the water and run around in the patio, and get each other with the hoses and stuff. So the pila was a wonderful place, the garden was a wonderful place.Olivia Arenas:	When you are growing up, do you have any special moments that you remember?Felix Arenas:	Oh my goodness. You know, I keep saying that everybody was there at the house, but especially in the holidays, in the wintertime, everybody would be there. All my tios and my tias they had their houses and they had their jobs and they had their lives. Some even lived in other cities. But on the weekends and in the holidays, everybody came over to spend time with my abuelito, my abuelita. So there was a generation of us cousins that grew up in that house.Felix Arenas:	One very beautiful memory that I treasure and that I remember all the time with my cousins is I remember waking up one winter morning, whole bunch of us cousins [00:15:00] sleeping on the floor, on mattresses, and the adults were on the beds. I woke up early before any of my other cousins, and I remember making my way over to the kitchen because there was noise there. When I looked in the kitchen, there was my grandma, and there was my mom, and there was your Tia Luz, and my Tia Cristina, and they were all fixing breakfast. Your grandma was directing everything. These were grown women with their husbands and their children, and they were still being directed. Grandma still ran the show there.Felix Arenas:	I remember my mom was kneeling at the metate and she was grinding corn for the tortillas, so that day, I remember it so wonderfully. It was a cold winter morning because the kitchen door, the glass panes were frosted over because the humidity of all the cooking that was going on in that kitchen, and it smelled wonderful. My Tia Luz was making some type of chile that she was going to make with the breakfast, and my Tia Cristina was fixing some type of meat, and my abuelita Catalina was fixing the coffee, a big pot of coffee. Back then there wasn't no drip dry or drip coffeemaker. It was the big old pot. You put the coffee in there and then you strain the coffee. Her coffee was always wonderful. As little kids, we got to drink coffee, but it was always diluted with a lot of milk. But it was wonderful. That memory of just watching my tias, my mom, and my grandma working and making breakfast is just something that has always stayed with me. Has always stayed with me.Felix Arenas:	Then let's see. There's another one. Of course, in the kitchen, my abuelita Catalina had a wood-burning stove, and that stove was always fired up in the wintertime, in the fall and in the wintertime. Along with a gas stove, she also had the wood-burning stove going. In the evenings, when all of us cousins had been running around and playing all day long after dinner and we were all tired, she would sit there by the stove and have her cup of coffee and smoke her cigarette. Sometimes she would be telling stories. She would tell stories of how life was for her back in Nazos. She would tell stories of how big the watermelons grew back home. If the kids had been particularly bad that day, she would tell stories of La Llorona, and how La Llorona was going to come and get us.Interviewer:	Who is La Llorona?Felix Arenas:	La Llorona is the folk tale of the woman that cried and cried and cried because she neglected her children. To this day, this folk story keeps going. It's one of our treasured folk stories. The story goes that La Llorona was a very vain young woman who was beautiful. She fell in love with a ranchero who was big, muscular, and handsome, and very macho. They had a couple of kids, they got together, got married. They had a couple of kids and the big macho ranchero [00:20:00] left her home. Because of her vanity, because she wanted to keep following him and go with him, she left the kids. She tore off looking for her man. The legend goes that the kids--Olivia Arenas:	I thought that the kids drowned.Felix Arenas:	The kids were playing by the river and they drowned. Somebody from the town went and told this girl that her kids had drowned and she came to looking for them. The legend goes that she keeps walking through the riverbanks looking for her kids and crying. ""Mis hijos! Donde esta mis hijos?!"" ""Where are my children? Where my children?"" So the legend goes that when you hear wailing and crying at night, it's La Llorona looking for her children or looking for any other children that'll take their place.Felix Arenas:	So my grandma used to tell that story or she would tell the story of how the devil appeared in a little cantina in a little nearby town, once again because some vain girl and boy that just wanted to be together left their family. To us little kids, that put the fear of God in us, and that settled us down and we would look at each other with great big eyes and open mouths. I remember everybody just sitting there wide-eyed, looking at grandma, and grandma would just have a great time telling those stories and scaring us. Those are two beautiful memories that I cherish to this day.Olivia Arenas:	How did my Grandma Julia and my Abuelito Felix meet? Tell me about that story.Felix Arenas:	Your abuelito.  Well, your Grandma Catalina, my mom's mother was a beautiful, strong woman, and like I said, her house was the house that the family members from the interior or Mexico came to visit and to stay at. She never turned anybody back. She was well known in the neighborhood. She helped everybody that came to her for help. So she was this great, big, influential woman in her neighborhood. She had seven kids. Your Grandma Julia was one of them. Grandma Julia didn't make it past the third grade back in Mexico at that time. They could pull out kids at anytime, so they could stay at home and work at the house. Grandma Julia was a obedient girl and she stayed around, she took care of the house, helped take care of the house, she helped take care of others families, others kids, also, just like her mother. So she was quite old when she met your Abuelito Felix.Felix Arenas:	Actually, your Abuelito Felix and his family lived across the street, so they kind of knew each other. Your Abuelito Felix was an electrician just like his older brother. So he was very popular too, because people would go ask favors of him to set up the electricity. Because back then, in Ciudad Juarez there wasn't a lot of houses with electricity. So my father was the big professional. Your grandma, Julia, my mom, and my dad, Felix, married when they were 29 years old.Felix Arenas:	Your grandfather Felix was this [00:25:00] great, big, beautiful man, also who was an electrician, very hardworking, but also very generous with his time. He used to help people. I remember as a little kid, people would knock on the door and there would be these strangers coming to the door asking my father for favors to go check out their electricity problems at their houses. My dad wouldn't turn anybody down and they would pay your dad how they could. I remember the baker from across the street down the corner came one time, asking my dad to do an installation of electricity. My dad went and we ate free bread for a few months.Olivia Arenas:	Abuelito helped him?Felix Arenas:	Yeah. He went and installed the wiring for the electricity at his bakery. They were just grateful and they paid him as they could. In other towns, little towns outside of Juárez, he helped many other relatives, wired their houses where there was no electricity. They got married, and they had me, your Tío Roberto, and your Tía Lupita, and we grew up. When I was little, we also lived in Phoenix, Arizona, and we also lived in El Paso for a while. But then he moved us back to Juárez because he wanted to be near his mother, my Abuelita Carmen, she was getting older.Felix Arenas:	So we moved back to Juárez, and we moved into the apartments that your Grandma Catalina had on the other side of her house. So we're living in the house, but on the other side of the garden. That's how they met. There's pictures of my dad with my mom and my tías. My dad had one of the few cars at that time, so my dad on Sundays would take people on Sunday drives. All my tías, all my tíos, loved my dad because he was one of these people that just love to have fun and laugh with everybody.Olivia Arenas:	He loved his family.Felix Arenas:	He loved his family and he loved my mom's family too, and they loved him back. My grandma, Catalina loved him. They made a pair wherever they went because he used to take her everywhere in his car, and she would not go anywhere with anybody except with my dad. We used to go to a little town called Sauzal, outside of Juárez to visit my grandma's sister way back in little branch outside of Juárez.Felix Arenas:	But she would not go with anybody else, except my dad. They made a great pair, because whenever we would get there to Sauzal, everybody would just go over to the house, there to greet us, and to be around. They knew that Abuelita Catalina was there in Sauzal was in town and my dad was in town. I remember people bringing chickens for the lunch, for the dinner. Watermelons, melons, cheeses that they had made, and they would all bring it in to have parties and stuff. It was wonderful.Olivia Arenas:	How did you and Tía Lupita and grandma end up in El Paso? How did you end up from Mexico in the US?Felix Arenas:	Well, the sad part of [00:30:00] it was that as big, and happy, and optimistic, and helpful, and generous as your Abuelito Felix was, there was something that nobody else knew was happening with him. When I was nine years old, he committed suicide. It was just a shock to everybody that knew him. Your grandma, Julia, had a breakdown for a couple of months. She was really out of it. So we moved into grandma's house at that point. Grandma and the other tías and tíos were raising us, really.Felix Arenas:	My mom's sisters and cousins all told her, ""You have to move to El Paso to a better life. You have to give your children a better life now. You don't have anybody else to depend on. You have to go to El Paso where you used to live."" So we made the move to El Paso and it took a lot for my mom to make that decision. It took a few months for her to leave the safety of her father and her mother in the nervous state that she was in. But we made the move to El Paso in 1966.Olivia Arenas:	What was it like coming from Mexico to the US?Felix Arenas:	Everything was different. To say that it was a culture shock was not putting it mildly. My mom was still very sensitive, very delicate that she was alone with her three kids, she was very afraid of everything. It was hard for her to be away from her father and her mother. Some days when we would be in school, she would go to Juarez, walk all the way to Juarez, make the long walk to Juarez to go visit her mother and her father during the day, and still walk back to El Paso to be there when we got out of school at three in the afternoon. I know it was hard for her and it was a big change for us.Felix Arenas:	We were living in a great, big, new, beautiful environment. Everything was different. What I remember is that everything worked the way it was supposed to work. The utilities, the schools, even the milkman was on time when he said he was going to be there at a certain time, on a certain day, he was there. In the US, in El Paso, everybody's opinion counted. Back in Mexico, it's sad to say, nobody's word or opinion counted. The news on TV were real. Things that were really happening down the street in the state, in the country, all those things mattered to everybody. The culture was real. We were living, this was the late '60s. It was a wonderful time and it was a hard time also in the US. There were a lot of inequities.Felix Arenas:	Just like we were [00:35:00] listening to the struggle for equal rights for African Americans at the time, us Mexican people didn't have many opportunities. The prejudice was there. It was a little more subtle in El Paso because there were so many of us in El Paso but you could tell that the prejudice and the limited opportunities were there. But at the same time, coming from Mexico, it was something totally different at that time. You can imagine going from mariachi music and the same old songs in Mexico to The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin, and all those other music, Janis Joplin. Oh my goodness, just listening to all these songs and the music of the '60s and early '70s, my eyes were just wide open. My mind was blown apart by just the music, the culture, the way The Beatles sang and played, and the way they put their whole life into it. It was just a fantastic time.Olivia Arenas:	So have you thought about this great family history of ours and where you fit into it and where me and my siblings fit into it? What does it all mean?Felix Arenas:	Of course, I've thought about it. I think about it all the time. We are part of the great human migration. Unlike those who were brought here from Africa who strengthened America with their hard work, or those who came from Europe and enriched life with their culture and their skills. Everybody looking for a better way, a better life. My grandparents, my abuelitos brought our family from the interior of Mexico to the Northern border. The next generation, my mother, and my father, and all our tios, made the journey into the new land and the new way of life.Felix Arenas:	My generation has taken the journey further, settling down, setting down roots, educating ourselves like never before in our family history, and then traveling around the world to learn more. I have cousins, your tios, and your primos, you have primos who are nurses and doctors, writers, artists, business executives, teachers, firemen and strong, productive citizens of this country. We have been able to push further because of who we are and where we came from and who we came from. There came a point in my life, even though my mother was not sure of it, where I embraced our new life, our new home.Felix Arenas:	I as the older kid, had to help my little sister, my brother, and my mom feel comfortable here. I embraced the strange changes, I embraced the opportunity to make something of ourselves and the freedom to retain our identity. I became a Boy Scout and I attained the highest rank of Eagle Scout. I became an honor student at Bowie High School, got married, had my four beautiful boys and girls.Felix Arenas:	I gave nine years of my life to the military. [00:40:00] But I know that I'm not only of the US, I have two loves, two cultures, two languages, two sets of foods that I love, two ways of thinking about life. That's the most wonderful gift my mother and my father gave me. That's the gift I have tried to pass onto you guys.Olivia Arenas:	It's a beautiful story dad. I love you. Thank you.Felix Arenas:	I love you baby.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
mby008941,"Lionel Frietze:	[00:00:00] Where's the camera though? Supposed to be candid.Emily Gavin:	Hello, my name is Emily Gavin. I'm 63 years old. I was born in New Mexico, and today is Sunday, February 12th, 2012. We're recording in Old Mesilla, New Mexico, where most of my ancestors came from on my father's side. My relationship to my partner is Lionel Frietze, and he's my cousin on the Frietze side.Lionel Frietze:	Okay. My name is Lionel Frietze, my age is 78 come four days from today. On February the 16th, we're in Mesilla. Today is February the 12th, 2012. In relationship to my interviewer is, we're cousins.Emily Gavin:	Good morning on this nice cold morning. Isn't it rare?Lionel Frietze:	No, as far as last year, we had it worse.Emily Gavin:	Okay.Lionel Frietze:	Minus eight, minus ten.Emily Gavin:	That's true. Well, you should know about the weather and how Mesilla is because you're a Mesillaero, and lived here all your life.Lionel Frietze:	Well, except the times that I was asked to leave town, and I went to the Navy. Anyway.Emily Gavin:	Well, let's start with your history.Lionel Frietze:	Okay. How I came to be here is, let me start with family history. My maternal great grandparents came from Santander, Spain. On the paternal side from Dillenburg, Germany. Now my great grandfather was General Domingo Cajen. He was executed in Chihuahua in 1860. My great grandmother, Arcalia Cajen, came to Texas and that's where my grandfather was raised and that's where he married my grandmother Dolora Garcia from Ojinaga and they made their home there in Fort Davis. Then they went to Shafter, where my mother was born. A few days later, they went back to Fort Davis, where they lived until my mother was about 16 years old, then they came to Mesilla. My dad was born here in Mesilla. When they got married in 1922, then I have an older brother who passed away. His name was Lancenceno then I had a sister by name of Lillian. She died when she was a year and a couple of months. In fact she was buried on Christmas day. Then came Mike, then Willie, then myself then Oscar. That's the five of us. Chenna passed away in 1979. My mother passed away a month later. This is how I came to be here.Emily Gavin:	How is it we're cousins then on the Frietze side, and Nasanceno was your great grandfather?Lionel Frietze:	My grandfather.Emily Gavin:	Your grandfather?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Okay. My great grandfather was his brother.Lionel Frietze:	Brother.Emily Gavin:	Yes. His brother. My great, great grandfather would have been his father. Daniel Frietze?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	From the German side.Lionel Frietze:	Right. Yes.Emily Gavin:	How many brothers and sisters were there? Were there just seven brothers that Daniel Frietze had? Seven sons?Lionel Frietze:	As far as I can recollect right now, there were just five sons.Emily Gavin:	There was seven sons.Lionel Frietze:	As I can recollect right now.Emily Gavin:	You have quite a history though, of Mesilla that you've been able to document.Lionel Frietze:	Well, I have in fact, I wrote the history of La Mesilla and her Mesillaneros. When I was born, well before a month later, I was baptized in my godparents, the Montoya's. Had a heck of a Sunday driving back and forth because my mother had said his name, is going to be L-I-O-N-E-L, [00:05:00] nothing else. They would come to the church and the priest says he has to have a saint christian name. We will put one on, he would go to one mother. She said, ""No way"" we won't baptize him if that's the case. Anyhow, finally, there was an accord reached between the priest every morning like Lita Montoya, but they didn't tell my mother, that they added the name Jose in front of my name. We never knew about it until I started to go to elementary school and they required a birth certificate or a baptismal certificate. We had to order one and it wouldn't be here in time for me to start school. I had already missed a year because being born in February. School starts at September, you had to be seven years old, at the time you started school. I never was able to get into that group. My mother gave them the baptismal certificate when she came to the church and got it. She had a fit. We went to the elementary school, I was enrolled. Elementary school Miss Foster looked at it and says, ""Ah. Jolie."" From then on, until I went to junior high. That's my name that I ran under. In junior high, I changed it to Lionel. Few weeks later, my dad talks to me in kind words and says, ""Where have you been?"" ""I've been in school."" ""No, you haven't."" ""I've been called by the principal, you have been skipping school."" I had not been answering to Lionel. I went back to too early. Graduated high school? It was Jolie. Which was another problem. When I started college, I had to get all sorts of affidavits that I was the same person.Emily Gavin:	I'm curious to know why was at that time in junior high when you were, okay, I'm going to be Lionel now.Lionel Frietze:	Why was it? Because it seems like you have dual identities. My family here knew me by one name, my school mates, knew me by another name, and I can to this day, know, who went to high school and junior high with me. Because, how they address me. The name that they use.Emily Gavin:	You are asserting yourself. You are asserting the fact that your birth certificate said Lionel?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	But everybody else had called you Jolie. Then, your father had received this letter saying that you didn't respond to Jolie anymore, right? You were responding only to Lionel?Lionel Frietze:	Well, excuse me. The letter was that, I was not in school. Basically, they were inferring that I was skipping school, which I was not. I was there, but just not answering.Emily Gavin:	To Jolie?Lionel Frietze:	Yes. Well, to Lionel.Emily Gavin:	To Lionel.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	But all these years you've been called Jolie.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Never being called Lionel until you went to high school?Lionel Frietze:	Except for the family members.Interviewer:	Your parents called you Lionel?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Leonel.Lionel Frietze:	You put the proper spelling and pronunciation, yes.Emily Gavin:	Or late to dinner, hurry up and do the chores.Lionel Frietze:	Well, that's another interesting story because my mother had a system. She would fix dinner and call us once. If she called you twice, then you wash dishes. If she call you a third time, then you had to do other chores in the kitchen. She made sure that we learned how to take care of the house, cook, bake, soak, iron, wash. My dad made sure that we knew how to work out in the fields.Emily Gavin:	Those were the tough times in Mesilla during those times, and I think they still continued, don't they?Lionel Frietze:	Well, yes. But at that point in time, for example, I recall one day my mom sent me to Frietze store, to buy some meat. I was [00:10:00] not really paying attention and I lost money, and it was only about $0.50 for a pound of meat. I spend about an hour-and-a-half looking for that $0.50 piece I never could find it. So I faced the consequences.Emily Gavin:	Tell us about the Frietze store.Lionel Frietze:	Well, that store had been there since I can recall. It was of what, generational thing, I guess, and it was closed down about 10 years ago, but prior to that, that was a landmark in Mesilla. There were two stores here in Mesilla, the Frietze store and the Fountain store. To their credit, they extended credit to all the farmers and most of the people here in Mesilla and they would go in there, pay them every month or whenever they got paid.Emily Gavin:	That was run by family members as well?Lionel Frietze:	Yes. It was a very close knit community to the point that when I was doing the research for the book. When I was a kid, I was very nosy, I used to ask questions, I was told where to go many times. I can spell that word very good also, but anyhow, I persisted and was able to get some information, quite a bit of information enough to put in the book, which I later researched but no, it was such a close community. What happened is you would ask a person, do you have, for example, pictures or information to verify this? Well, I do, but I'll call you later. I told them exactly what I was going to do with the information. Later only came after the first edition of the book came out, then I got all the information coming forth, which is in the second edition.Emily Gavin:	What made you write the book? Was this a project for school or how did it come about?Lionel Frietze:	It was something that I needed to do because I was a little bit perturbed at how we were being portrayed.Emily Gavin:	We being?Lionel Frietze:	We being a community, things that did not happen. Billy the Kid, for example, was here in jail. That's the only time I could place him here through my research. I hate to say this, but I told an author that they got off the bus and they wrote about us immediately without knowing who we are. My question to the individual was, ""Did you do your research?"" and he said yes, and I says, ""Are you bilingual?"" He said No. I says, ""Then how did you do your research? Since all the records up to a certain year are in Spanish?"" At that point, he walked away. This is one of the reasons plus fact I told my kids, ""If I can't give you anything other than this I'm going to give you, so you'll know where you came from and where we're at.""Emily Gavin:	What is the most important thing about the book as to where we came from?Lionel Frietze:	It's important as far as I'm concerned, to know that we are a conglomerate of all nationalities because at one point in time in Mesilla, you could find just about every nationality that lived here; be they from France, Italy, Germany, Spain, you name it. They were here because it was crossroads between San Antonio and the West Coast. That was a part of it. In part of it I just wanted to get it off my system.Emily Gavin:	What was one of the most surprising things that you learned in doing your research of the book?Lionel Frietze:	I wasn't really surprised with many of the things that I found because my mother and father were very open with us, they told us exactly. My mother used to tell us, your great grandfather was a general in the Spanish army to start with, then transferred to the Mexican army. [00:15:00] My reaction was, ""Oh, yeah. Sure."" Lo and behold he is in Mexican history, and I forget the title of that Bibliography of Chihuahuas, something to that effect. That's where his name appears and I said to myself, ""She was right.""Interviewer:	Sorry. For the record, do you know his name? Your great-grandfather?Lionel Frietze:	Sure. Domingo Cajen, C-A-J-E-N. Domingo Cajen.Emily Gavin:	So another story. Well, there are so many stories that can come out of the book, and where Mesilla used to be La Mesilla. Tell us your earliest recollection of growing up here, what it was like?Lionel Frietze:	It was fantastic. We didn't have much, but nobody else did so we didn't know that.Emily Gavin:	Fantastic in what way?Lionel Frietze:	In the give and take of the residents. For example, if they had a matanza or they killed a pig, they butchered a pig, they would have gathered to [inaudible 00:16:21] on the other and everybody was invited. Everybody that went when they left, they took some. It was a very sharing community. We all knew when somebody was in trouble health-wise, when somebody passed away, first thing you heard was the bells and you knew exactly what happened. That is the bells from the church and I think it's still continued. But I was born about three, four blocks from here.Emily Gavin:	You were born in the house?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Not at a hospital, at that time people were born in homes.Lionel Frietze:	No. At the house. In fact, my grandmother and I'll get to her Urvana after a while. She's the one that delivered, she was a midwife. See my grandfather passed away when my dad was nine years old. He passed away in 1911, my dad was born in 1902. So my grandmother never remarried but she took care of all the kids and there was several aunts, several uncles. From that point on, when I started school, we were restricted as to where we could go in Mesilla. Our dividing line was the ditch, there by the Frietze store. The only time we would come to the plaza would be to fiestas or to church. Other than that we had to stay in Las Arenales.Emily Gavin:	What are the Arenales?Lionel Frietze:	The Arenales were sand dunes, they're no longer there. There's a school there and houses. So it changed quite a bit. It was very quiet, I remember tourists coming in their big fancy cars asking us if they could drive over the sand dunes. Who were we to tell them they couldn't? They would try it. Of course, we made money on the side because my dad's tractors were there and we would go and pull them out. But anyhow, getting back to growing up. It's when I started elementary school, shortly thereafter, they started the cafeteria, which is where the Thunderbird gift shop is now located, and that was our school cafeteria.Emily Gavin:	It's here on the corner on the plaza?Lionel Frietze:	Yes. They used to march us all the way to the elementary school, which my dad was the custodian there for 25 years. He was also farming on the side so he kept us active and busy. So our time was very limited as to where we went, what we did.Emily Gavin:	What inspired you to go into legal work or being a judge?Lionel Frietze:	Curiosity. Many years ago, I have [00:20:00] an LLB from La Salle, which is Bachelors in Liberal Law. I did that because when I was going TDY, I didn't really have time to go out and party all the time so I studied.Emily Gavin:	So this is when you were in the Navy?Lionel Frietze:	No, this is afterwards.Emily Gavin:	Okay.Lionel Frietze:	Yes. I was working for the government then. I used to travel quite a bit. I had those books with me and that's what I did. It was just curiosity, not that I was going to make a living out of it because that was not my interest. I had a very good job.Emily Gavin:	What was that?Lionel Frietze:	Most of it is classified so I can't get into that.Emily Gavin:	But you worked for the government?Lionel Frietze:	Yes, I did.Emily Gavin:	Okay.Lionel Frietze:	Thirty-one years total. I retired 25 years ago, I shifted gears. After I retired, I started doing volunteer work to the point where they would tell me, ""You have to do this."" I would remind them, ""I'm a volunteer, so you can tell the next person to do it.""Emily Gavin:	Did you happen to influence your brother in being a judge as well?Lionel Frietze:	No. As a matter of fact, he received his degree in music. He started teaching. About two months later he says, ""If I'm going to have to put up with these kids, I might as well have a uniform on."" So he joined state police.Emily Gavin:	That was Oscar?Lionel Frietze:	Yes. He retired from there. Then when he retired a year or so, that's when he was elected to magistrate.Emily Gavin:	So he became a judge before you became a judge.Lionel Frietze:	Way before I did, yes.Emily Gavin:	Now you've been a judge for eight years?Lionel Frietze:	Eight years, and I'm headed into my next term. I'm unopposed so I think I'm going to be there for another four years, God willing.Emily Gavin:	What changes have you seen in Mesilla than in, let's say the last 30 years, and then 20, and then 10?Lionel Frietze:	In 1959, when Mesilla incorporated again, they put a green belt, which is farming of no less than five acres. That was a good thing because otherwise we would be house-to-house loaded, where Mesilla would not be what it is now. It was a hard fight to keep it that way, because let's face it, many individuals have come into this community. When they first came the question was, how can you live in mud houses? Those were the same people that later on came in and says, ""I will give you X number of dollars."" Many individuals decided, ""Hey, that's a lot of money."" Not realizing that once they took that money, their home was gone. They couldn't buy anything for what they had been offered or what they had sold for. So therefore, another citizen moved out. It was almost like gentrification, and it's like what happened in Santa Fe.Emily Gavin:	What happened in Santa Fe?Lionel Frietze:	Well, in Santa Fe, if you look back at their records, the Hispanics were basically displaced because influential people, money people, came in, bought their places and all of a sudden they could not afford to keep. If you have a $30,000 home next to a $3 million home, this was going to go out. That's gentrification. That's what we were afraid was going to happen here in Mesilla. Fortunately, it has not happened completely.Emily Gavin:	But there have been some changes, right? You don't hear so many of the roosters crowing, or people have their chickens running around in the yards.Lionel Frietze:	No. The thing is, and here again, I hate to be saying this, people that come in to the community. Because unfortunately, the first thing that has [00:25:00] happened is, they'll come in, they'll look at the place, "" Oh, it's nice. Oh my good neighbor."" As soon as they buy their place, they put the biggest fence they can get, and get away with. So therefore, mi casa no es tu casa.Emily Gavin:	My house isn't your house.Lionel Frietze:	Not at all. Where mi casa es tu casa, my house is your home. That's one of the problems that happened. This has happened here in this community, unfortunately.Emily Gavin:	What things has Mesilla been able to keep per traditions?Lionel Frietze:	Well, there hasn't been too much of a change here on the plaza itself. Although there's been a lot of effort put into trying to really destroy the landscape or the buildings, what has been there for years, and they have been stopped. Of course, we have all these people coming in and complaining that, ""You are against progress. You're keeping the merchants from making a living."" Like Cesar Oliviar when he was in the board of trustees, he used to tell them, "" You come to Mesilla to make money and you do. Because if you don't make money, you're gone and you don't care what happens to us."" So basically that has been the motto. We try to maintain our historical community.Emily Gavin:	There's still a lot of pockets of poverty here in Mesilla.Lionel Frietze:	There will be. In any community you're going to find that because see, people up in the 70, 80, 90-year-old category wind up in Social Security. That is basically the only thing they have. Now, in Social Security you only get a portion of what you put in. Sometimes if the taxes go up or whatever happens, light goes up, utilities go up, you have to cut somewhere. So that's where you see the pockets of poverty. You can be land rich but money poor. This has been normal here in this community for years.Emily Gavin:	What are some of the beautiful things that have been kept?Lionel Frietze:	Well, you look at the church, and it's been there since 1906. It has been and will always be. Some tourists come to see and now that it's a basilica, even more so. Unfortunately, many of us that live here we go to church only when we have to. We just let somebody else do the praying for us.Emily Gavin:	But we have different vendors, different merchants, and now there's things that are going on in the plaza.Lionel Frietze:	Well, for example, today you have the vendors and they come in on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. It's farmers supposed to be a farmers merchants type of vendors, but it's turned out to be just about every other whatever they make, and I think that the resident merchants, and by resident I mean they have the established buildings, resent that because there's politics into it like everything.Emily Gavin:	That wasn't around growing up in Mesilla.Lionel Frietze:	No.Emily Gavin:	You said you were going to tell the story about your grandma Olobana, she's on your mother side, right?Lionel Frietze:	No, that's on my dad's side.Emily Gavin:	On your dad side?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Okay.Lionel Frietze:	Well, as I said my grandmother became a widow in 1911, and she raised three daughters and four sons and she made a living however she could, off the farm and off of being a midwife. Also, I don't think there's too many people that would say that they probably have the only grandmother that had a presidential pardon.Emily Gavin:	A presidential pardon?Lionel Frietze:	Yes, for boot-legging.Emily Gavin:	We want to hear that.Lionel Frietze:	Which was common at that point in time here in Mesilla, just about everybody made [00:30:00] wine and everybody sold wine, which was illegal. I know my dad made about 500 gallons, but he had a permit. But he also made [inaudible 00:30:10] equivalent to white lighten 180 proof, that was illegal, but we used to make it. But my grandmother.Emily Gavin:	How did was it about that she got arrested? Tell us.Lionel Frietze:	Well, that portion how she was arrested, she was turned in by someone that was arrested and he rolled over and said, well, ""She sells more than I do so why didn't you get her?"" That's how she was arrested and tried. She went all the way to Santa Fe and was about to turn herself in, but she had been politically connected to Dennis Travis, US Senator Travis. When he heard that she was being convicted he started doing his maneuvering. When she got to Santa Fe the warden got the word ""Turn her back, she goes back to Mesilla."" Then in 19, can't recall the date when she was given a presidential pardon.Emily Gavin:	Which President was there?Lionel Frietze:	Roosevelt. So, infamous.Emily Gavin:	A Presidential pardon?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Do you have that document?Lionel Frietze:	Yes, I do.Emily Gavin:	Is that in your book as well?Lionel Frietze:	No it isn't.Emily Gavin:	So there's a third version, should becoming up then?Lionel Frietze:	Well, there's a lot of interesting things that I could put in another book and, but we'll see in four years if I have time.Emily Gavin:	What interesting things do you remember growing up as a child? We have in the area may be, okay, the merchants, you had the farmers, there's the blacksmith's shop.Lionel Frietze:	Well, it was interesting during the war, my brother Oscar and I used to come and we would go to Frietze Store, get a pack of cigarettes for my mother, my mother never smoked. Then we would slip over to Fountain Store, which is right across the street from where we're at now, buy another pack and this was on a Sunday. Then we would go and sit under a bridge and smoke two packs in about an hour.Emily Gavin:	How did you feel?Lionel Frietze:	Horrible. But if you watch the news reels at the time, you would see people smoking all the time and it looked very cool. So therefore, we were cool until my mother found out about it, then it was not cool anymore.Emily Gavin:	This is when you were in the military?Lionel Frietze:	No, this was when, that was about seven, nine years old, I guess, this was during the war, World War II.Interviewer:	How did you found out?Lionel Frietze:	In Mesilla they had a telegraph system that mothers knew exactly what was going on. I don't know, but she knew.Interviewer:	How did she go about getting the truth from you?Lionel Frietze:	Very simple, she asked. My mother and my dad, you told the truth, they could live with it, you would lie to them, you better be able to get some padding because you are going to get it. There was none of this that wait until your dad hears about this, no. The decision was made right then and there, there was no appeal, it was a sentence and it was carried out.Emily Gavin:	Well, I think that's where you got your startup of being a judge, wasn't?Lionel Frietze:	Probably.Emily Gavin:	Probably.Lionel Frietze:	But you know getting back to your grandfather Simon, the blacksmith's shop, because I used to sit in that seems there and he would be working away with this equipment or if he was not busy, he would be out there reading the newspaper.Emily Gavin:	And hold court there?Lionel Frietze:	Yes, so it was great even though we didn't have much but we didn't need much. We made our [00:35:00] own entertainment, nowadays if they don't have the iPod, or TV, or three cell phones going on at the same time they're lost.Emily Gavin:	How many children do you have and grandchildren?Lionel Frietze:	I have three, two daughters and one son. Grandchildren I have six.Emily Gavin:	What would you like to leave them with as far as a little quote, something to inspire them for their future?Lionel Frietze:	Get an education. Continue your education. Because like my parents used to tell us, ""No one can take that away from you. You can lose everything, but you will never lose knowledge."" That's what I keep telling my grand kids. I have two going to the university in Ohio because that's where they live in Ohio. The others are in Europe. So I don't know what they're going to do. Basically, that's it. Been married 56 years and she had eye surgery two weeks ago.Emily Gavin:	Her name?Lionel Frietze:	Catherine Perry. After surgery, I asked her, ""How do you feel?"" She looked at me and says, ""Who are you?"" I said, ""God."" It's good that she was blind. Fantastic. She's put up with me for that many years. A keeper.Emily Gavin:	Is she also from Mesilla?Lionel Frietze:	No. She's a Texan, just like my mom.Emily Gavin:	Well, I think you've had a very interesting life and continue to have that. Any parting words you'd like to say too?Lionel Frietze:	As far as parting words, no, because I hope to be here in another 70 years. My goal is to hit 150.Emily Gavin:	Good. Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you, Primo, cousin.Lionel Frietze:	Well, my pleasure.Emily Gavin:	Thank you.Lionel Frietze:	When we do the next interview, I hope you're here.Emily Gavin:	Thank you very much. God bless you.Lionel Frietze:	Thank you.Interviewer:	I did have some questions that I'd like to have in the record. You guys are cousins. How many cousins do you think you have in Mesilla?Lionel Frietze:	I don't know.Emily Gavin:	Oh my goodness. I have relatives on both my grandmothers and grandfathers side, and then going back to theirs because they were born here before that and it goes generations. We're, you and I are what? Third-generation?Lionel Frietze:	Third generation.Emily Gavin:	Third generation removed. But everywhere we turn around, when I was going to school here my grandma said, ""Oh no, you can't go out with him. He's your cousin. Oh no, you can't go with him. He's your cousin."" You had the same thing. You married outside of Mesilla.Lionel Frietze:	Yes. Right. See, not too many years ago, my niece, Yvonne, received a call from someone in Texas.Emily Gavin:	Fredericksburg, Texas.Lionel Frietze:	Trying to get information as to who I was, because there were some missing link in their family tree, which was Daniel. We have cousins in Fredericksburg, Dallas, Houston, that I have never met.Emily Gavin:	That's on the German side.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	They came in the late 1800s or mid 1800s, it was a schooner of Germans from Germany and people from Germany that came through Galveston. I know Yvonne has done a lot of research on that and how most of the people on the ship passed away because it was an influenza that was--Lionel Frietze:	Yellow fever.Emily Gavin:	Yellow fever.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	They ended up in Fredericksburg, but somehow Daniel followed. Was that during the Confederacy? Anyway, he ended up here with eight other German gentlemen.Lionel Frietze:	Well, he came here prior to that because he was here on 1852, 53. He had followed Luis, who was his relative. Luis had a bakery. Catty-corner [00:40:00] to the church on the east side of the plaza, here in Mesilla.Emily Gavin:	Luis Frietze.Lionel Frietze:	Yes. That was Frietze Bakery. That's why it came in this direction. Then he met his wife and he got married.Emily Gavin:	Maria Felicitas Alderete.Lionel Frietze:	Yes, Alderete.Emily Gavin:	Española.Lionel Frietze:	But my grandmother was not Maria Felicita.Emily Gavin:	No.Lionel Frietze:	No. She happened to be a 16-year-old kid, or young lady.Emily Gavin:	Your grandfather was a half-brother to my great-grandfather.Lionel Frietze:	Yes. Right.Emily Gavin:	Because we're different generation. That's where the seven sons come in.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Yours is in the middle. There was I think -Lionel Frietze:	Almost at the bottom.Emily Gavin:	-Towards the end.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	But grew up, she raised him.Lionel Frietze:	Well, see, his mother. I know Mariana Chavez tried to take him to Colorado, which is now Rodey. Daniel said, ""No. You can go, but he stays.""Emily Gavin:	That's not the state Colorado. Colorado is the town in New Mexico.Lionel Frietze:	No, that's Rodey. Rodey, New Mexico, by Hatch. He would not allow her to take my grandfather. Finally, my grandfather stayed with Felicitas and Daniel. That's how he was raised. Now, when my grandfather died, she came to visit my grandfather, just prior to his death.Emily Gavin:	So you did get to meet?Lionel Frietze:	My dad met her once. He was nine years old and never knew what ever happened to her because she went, from what I understand, to Las Ancion in the 1870s.Emily Gavin:	Then your grandfather was raised with the rest of the Frietze's?Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	As a brother of full-fledged brother.Lionel Frietze:	Yes.Emily Gavin:	Not any different.Lionel Frietze:	Right.Emily Gavin:	But they are brothers.Lionel Frietze:	They are.Emily Gavin:	So we all have quite a history.Lionel Frietze:	It's interesting. When I was growing up and I used to say, ""Well, Jose. Don't be nosy."" But fortunately I was, and I continue to be.Emily Gavin:	Well, the Frietze store, from what I understand then, was started. Didn't Daniel Frietze, well, your great grandfather, my great, great grandfather started that, and then continued with Roberto Frietze's father, Daniel Frietze.Lionel Frietze:	Right.Emily Gavin:	The junior who was my grandmother's brother.Lionel Frietze:	Then Albino took over. Albino, Robert and Gucho. Because uncle Fred -Emily Gavin:	They went to California.Lionel Frietze:	Well, [inaudible 00:43:00] went to El Paso. Fred went to California. To answer the question how many cousins I have.Emily Gavin:	How many cousins do we have.Lionel Frietze:	I have no earthly idea.Interviewer:	Well, thank you for the lovely history.Emily Gavin:	You're welcome. Thank you.Lionel Frietze:	You're welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
mby008945,"Denise Chavez:	[00:00:00] I didn't get that joke. Okay. My name is Denise Chavez. I'm aged 63, I think. I could be 64, I get confused. Today is February the 12th, 2012. We're here on Mesilla Plaza, New Mexico, and I'm here with my sister, Faride Chavez Conway.Faride Chavez Conway:	My name is Faride Chavez Conway. My age is 72. The date is February the 12th, 2012, and location is Mesilla, New Mexico. I'm Denise's oldest sister.Denise Chavez:	I think that's a good point of departure, because you always -- As sisters, you always say, ""I am the oldest sister."" And that is very true, Faride, that's so important. You were always and have always been a role model to me. I don't think you realize that so much, but as the oldest sister and three wild sisters, that's quite a role, isn't it?Faride Chavez Conway:	It was, it still is. But it was a way of helping mother, I believe, being the oldest sister and kind of being your guardians. I feel like I was a sounding board for some things, not all of them, but some of them that were important to you. I think that there was a time that I kept the family together, because if you remember correctly, we used to hide in closets when we were little to keep from hearing the yelling that was going on.Denise Chavez:	Our father is an alcoholic, and I don't remember the closet so much. I do remember mother crying and carrying on. Yes, I remember a lot of the pain of living an alcoholic, and that's why it's so hard for me to be around bars, alcoholism, to even walk into El Patio here. It's just like there's too much static for me, I don't like that. But it's interesting today because I realized something when we were over there talking earlier. Mother had a previous marriage, your father, and I thought that she wore black for nine years and you corrected that this morning. I didn't realize -- Imagine a woman vestida de luto for nine years --What I thought was nine, but you actually said it was seven years. When did our mother in her first marriage start wearing color? It was after she met daddy, our dad, here in Las Cruces?Faride Chavez Conway:	It was after she met our dad, and that they married, she was still wearing some black. And I don't know if it's because she couldn't afford to go and get a brand new wardrobe when she decided to, or if it was because she was no longer mourning. There was a deep period of her life, there are those seven years that she mourned deeply for my dad because they weren't married that long.Denise Chavez:	How long was mother married to Tiburcio Faver, your father?Faride Chavez Conway:	He was born in March, I think it was March the 5th, of 1904. Even though the baptismal certificate says that he was born in February. I don't know exactly for sure, but that's the date I've always have been given with, in March. Then, they got married. I turned seven just before they got married, and I was eight or almost eight. I'm trying to think. You were born in 1948?Denise Chavez:	That's right, August.Faride Chavez Conway:	I was born in 1939, so I was what? Eight years, nine years older than you are, basically.Denise Chavez:	See, maybe that's where I got the nine-year connection there, I was associating [00:05:00] nine. Let me ask you this, where was our father? Epifanio E, the man of many names, very Russian names, Epi, Ernesto, Epifanio, Chano. Where did mother and daddy, Delfina, our mother, Delfina, where did they get married? Was it in Carlsbad or was it here?Faride Chavez Conway:	The first time they got married, they got married in Juarez.Denise Chavez:	Oh, they did. Were you there at present?Faride Chavez Conway:	No. I had been dropped off at my Aunt Genoveva Height's, because then mother had gone to teach in Carlsbad. The fact that they had been in such a tumultuous relationship there at the end with Sophie Ward, and mother, and everything else, mother just decided it was time to leave the area and let them fight it out between the two of them. And that's where we were going then. But they had corresponded all summer when she was working on her masters then at the University of Mexico. So they started corresponding, and then he met her, and Tio Beto and Pansy were their witnesses, and they got married.Denise Chavez:	That they got married again? I didn't realize that.Faride Chavez Conway:	Then, we went to Carlsbad and daddy came back to Las Cruces, I'm assuming. Then after some time, I think mother was already pregnant with you when they had a church ceremony.Denise Chavez:	Probably here in Las Cruces, right?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah. It's Aunt Genoveve's and I'm pretty sure it was Father Kurgan that married them.Denise Chavez:	I didn't realize that.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	Well, gosh.Faride Chavez Conway:	It was Aunt Elsia and I don't know who the padrino was.Denise Chavez:	In a way, your story is so big, I hope that you can write a book some time about your father, his legacy, Tiburcio Faver, the Faver family from the Big Bend area. I know at one point, you told me that you had started things. Did you ever find that paperwork or was it chewed up by the computer? What happened to the beginning of that story that you had begun?Faride Chavez Conway:	You know, I haven't really looked for it. I was too busy writing my obituary.Denise Chavez:	Do you have that written?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	Okay. You're ready to go.Faride Chavez Conway:	Basically. Yeah, I'm ready to go.Denise Chavez:	Well, I need to have that.Faride Chavez Conway:	Hi, I've paid for the funerals, everything is there. And so that the kids, no one has to bother with it. It happened after we came back from Joe's granddaughter's funeral. We ended up having to pay for it and it was $8,000 for a minimum funeral.Denise Chavez:	Oh my. Well, does somebody know where that paperwork is?Faride Chavez Conway:	No.Denise Chavez:	Okay. Well, somebody will know.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah. I'm just going to have to look for it in the computer and some of those files that I haven't had the ambition to even go into all the time.Denise Chavez:	Well, you've had an incredible life. There's no two ways about it. Your father, the legacy of the Faver family. Milton Faver was your great grandfather, was that it?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes.Denise Chavez:	Where did he come from?Faride Chavez Conway:	There is two different stories. One, that he came from England, and the other one that he came from Virginia. I would believe the latter part even though there's somebody that -- You've seen in Elisa Louhan's blog to say that he was part Indian and had been a Hispanic person.Denise Chavez:	I find that hard to believe.Faride Chavez Conway:	I do too and I don't think so. I know he was English because there's a Faversham in England that still exists and it's spelled F-A-V-E-R, which is usual. There's the French, F-A-V-I-E-R, and the German, F-A-B-E-R. And he was probably -- He was a businessman in a sense because he thought he had killed a man in Missouri, and then he went to Chihuahua and there's where he met his wife, who was the daughter of a very wealthy -- I believe they owned mines and stuff -- And so she got married. She was not the most beautiful [00:10:00] person in the world and I think the father was glad to see her get married even if it was to an Anglo. They started -- They had this trading company and he would supply all of the forts in the Big Bend area, Fort Davis, Fort Hancock, Fort Stockton, with their goods. And he used camels. He had camels out there in the desert to --Denise Chavez:	Sorry, I spit on you.Faride Chavez Conway:	I should not have looked at you -- But to start.Denise Chavez:	To start his trade.Faride Chavez Conway:	His trade and they go back and forth.Denise Chavez:	Well, that was very bright though because they could endure. It's so dry and dusty out there.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah, it's probably the driest part of Texas, the Big Bend country. Therefore he made quite a bit of money. He had cattle that roamed from Chihuahua all the way to we call Casa Blanca now in Texas and everything else.Denise Chavez:	Oh my gosh.Faride Chavez Conway:	They had one son, Juan, and they sent him to a college in Europe. Then when he came home, he married a lady from Ojinaga who also was very wealthy. Then he was told that she was having an affair with one of the generals. But no one's sure if it was a French general, a Mexican general, or an English general, whatever it was. But they had a duel and he got cut up pretty bad. He killed the general but he ended up being paralyzed on one side. There's two stories, two rumors that go. One of them was that Milton paid the Mexican government something like $15,000 and kept him out of prison. The other one is that he took him back and made him serve, because in Mexico, the maximum sentence is 20 years for whatever it is.Denise Chavez:	For whatever offense.Faride Chavez Conway:	And so, he was in his 40s when he married my grandmother, Gumecinda Ceriah. And I think she was 13 or 14.Denise Chavez:	Gume, G-U-M-E?Faride Chavez Conway:	G-U-M-E-C-I-N-D-A, Gumecinda. And there's other people that say it's Gumer.Denise Chavez:	I wondered about that. I guess I had heard it Gumer but now I'm glad you're correcting that to Gumecinda. Who was she?Faride Chavez Conway:	She was the daughter of the head, what do you call, the range boss of Milton Cibalo?Denise Chavez:	Milton CibaloFaride Chavez Conway:	Yeah. He took care of everything, he took care of all the workers and stuff. Then he had built the fort El Fortin which was up at the Chinati mountains that had water, the spring that feeds all that area with the cricks and everything else that had that. They had a peach orchard and he made peach brandy malt in them.Denise Chavez:	Oh my gosh.Faride Chavez Conway:	I mean, he had -- And he also -- The other reason I think that he was from Virginia is because he had a whipping post inside the Fortin. Whoever he whipped I don't know.Denise Chavez:	Punish people.Faride Chavez Conway:	People don't like it that but he punished them. Then I don't know if you remember seeing that picture of the Fortin where there was this small narrow slot. When the Indians would try, it was an illusion because when they got in there, they got stuck and they couldn't -- And that's --That body or maybe two bodies are the ones that would stop the Indians from getting into the fort itself. So, he had -- To me the whipping post comes from the South. It's a Southern thing, a way of punishing people, whatever.Denise Chavez:	Oh my goodness. I remember seeing Rawhide on TV. I was always kind of jealous of you in a way because you had such a legacy of all those people coming from Gill Faver. They based that somewhat on,Faride Chavez Conway:	Milton.Denise Chavez:	Milton Faver, ''Hit him up, round him up.'' It was always very glamorous to think about the Big Bend area, the history of that. Do you ever feel that that's like an incredible part of your life? It's like a story you can't even make up. It's like a dream.Faride Chavez Conway:	[00:15:00] Whenever they talked, for example, when I went to Aunt Lucy's dedication to that new school there in Presidio --Denise Chavez:	Yes.Faride Chavez Conway:	This guy that had done the work and everything else, he says ''I'd give anything to meet a Faver,'' and all Juan Franco says, ''There she is right there, '' and I'm going, ''Yeah. Hi.'' Because you know me, I prefer being in the background. I enjoy watching other people do the thing and I might enjoy running it, but I don't want to be out there in front.Denise Chavez:	Well, it's a lot to be in front. I have to say that it's tiresome, but still it's an incredible legacy of a family,. There's a book that needs to be written, pictures, books, history. There have been books, there's a lot of story that has emerged, but to me they're never the full stories.Faride Chavez Conway:	But the problem is the way they wrote at that time, and the people that wrote those books have never acknowledged Gumecinda Ceriah and her children, like they didn't exist. They weren't part of Milton's legacy, they kind of like gloss over it.Denise Chavez:	Were they married or they were never married?Faride Chavez Conway:	Who?Denise Chavez:	Gumercinda. Gumecinda, excuse me.Faride Chavez Conway:	I think she was married to him. I mean, how could my dad be the only legitimate child of John Faver and Gumecinda Ceriah when he was the seventh child born?Denise Chavez:	Well, there you go. People don't want to acknowledge that she was a Mexicana.Faride Chavez Conway:	No, and she was very fair and she had reddish-brown hair. The time -- You know, I had blonde hair as a kid.Denise Chavez:	Was she attractive? Was she beautiful? She must have been in her day and age.Faride Chavez Conway:	I think she was. I don't know, but she was the foreman -- I just remembered, the wrench foreman's daughter. She was not educated, she didn't read, and she didn't write. And our cousin, Juan Frano, on mother's side of the family, is the one that would go and sign things for her and witness her X.Denise Chavez:	So she never did learn to read or write?Faride Chavez Conway:	She was busy having children and she was spotless.Denise Chavez:	Her house was immaculate, huh?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah, it was spotless. You'd have to rinse the dishes ten times with boiling water off the stove, because she had one of those wood stoves that had the water trough and back. She always had a hot water, and you had to before you could dry them and put them away.Denise Chavez:	Well, that must have been hard. I would have had a hard time living in that environment, gosh. But that's the way she wanted it, that was the lifeFaride Chavez Conway:	She had nothing else, her children and her house, you know, and being a good wife.Denise Chavez:	How old was she when she passed on? I remember her, I remember that house.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah. I think she was in her 90s. I don't remember. Okay.Denise Chavez:	I remember a dark house. This is my memory with a lot of incredible, beautiful furniture. Well, you have memories, I was just a little girl, but I still remember vague beautiful darkness.Faride Chavez Conway:	The thing that really upsets me is the fact that if Aunt Francis hadn't been so selfish and had given every one of the brothers and sisters something from that house, then that would have been less than the fire she set because she got busy talking on the phone. You remember how that --Denise Chavez:	Yeah. I had forgotten the story. She was on the phone talking.Faride Chavez Conway:	She decided to burn the orchard in the back that went to the Cibolo Creek, because the grass is high and stuff. So she started the blaze and she was, ""The phone rang."" She went in and answered instead of letting it ring, and then forgot and talked to this lady, for I don't know how long when she remembered, and when she went out there, it was all ablaze.Denise Chavez:	The peach trees? Everything, huh?Faride Chavez Conway:	No, this -- Yeah. She had apple trees back, that was the downtown. The peach trees were up in the mountain.Denise Chavez:	Okay.Faride Chavez Conway:	The Chinati mountains. She called the fire department. But the fire department was in Marfa, that was the closest one. That was 40 miles they had to travel before they get there, and by the time they [00:20:00] got there, the house was burned out. I remember when Joe and I went to see it, all you could seen was the skeleton, the metal that didn't --Denise Chavez:	Terrible.Faride Chavez Conway:	But the adobe burned. All that gorgeous furniture that had been imported from Europe burned. She had those hand painted globes, oil lamps, they're absolutely beautiful.Denise Chavez:	Exquisite, huh?Faride Chavez Conway:	They were gone.Denise Chavez:	Everything all gone. I can't imagine.Faride Chavez Conway:	Her piano. The piano that I loved to play, because I thought I could play the piano, because it was a player piano that had come from St. Louis. I think it was 1845.Denise Chavez:	She must have hated herself. How did she feel about that?Faride Chavez Conway:	No, Aunt Francis -- I don't know. She was kind of a weird duck. She was probably the whitest of all of them and the blue eyes and stuff. She married Ira Cline,  one of the first Texas Rangers.Denise Chavez:	Well, there's a story.Faride Chavez Conway:	And Uncle Ira taught me how to eat rattlesnake meat, and how to eat steak with just some lemon squeezed over it and salt and pepper.Denise Chavez:	So you mean raw steak? Like the steak tartare? How does rattlesnake tastes?Faride Chavez Conway:	Chicken.Denise Chavez:	I knew you were going to say that. Everything tastes like chicken, right?Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, it does taste like chicken. It's not different like an alligator. Alligator meat definitely has a fishy type thing, but rattlesnake -- What is this again? It's white meat.Denise Chavez:	Yes. Did you grow up then, those seven years? Where were you living when mother was wearing black? What was your trajectory? Where did you go?Faride Chavez Conway:	Our mother taught in Radford, and she taught in some little town.Denise Chavez:	El Indio? Is that where El Indio comes in, or later?Faride Chavez Conway:	El Indio came in before.Denise Chavez:	That's when she was young. Yes.Faride Chavez Conway:	Then she taught in Shafter, and that's how she met my dad.Denise Chavez:	Yeah, that's right.Faride Chavez Conway:	But she was renting at that time, the house. The teacher, especially if she wasn't married with a family, so she wouldn't be a bad girl.Denise Chavez:	Okay.Faride Chavez Conway:	Mother was housed with Genoveva Height, who was a Faver, and dad's probably third. There was Milton and Henry, and then there was Grusin. So she was the fourth child, and daddy was the seventh child, and that's where she met me. She tells the story about how she woke up and she was startled because she had slept through the morning when she first moved there, and what woke her up was the church bells. She says she heard them, threw some water on her face, and got dressed and had just walked into the church and she was going for the front to be blessed herself, and there was this gorgeous man right there. They collided. Then she said, ""Ah, he's gorgeous."" Then she went up in the choir loft because she wanted to watch him, and that's what it was. Then Mrs. White told her that she wanted her to come and have dinner with her on, let's say, Wednesday. I don't know what day it was because her brother was coming over for dinner and she wanted to introduce him. And lo and behold it was the guy that she'd run into and butted heads with in church.Denise Chavez:	Was he living -- Was Tiburcio, or Bucho, as he was called -- Was he living there in Shafter at that time or had he gone and come back?Faride Chavez Conway:	He never went anywhere.Denise Chavez:	He never went anywhere? He lived there all his life. What did he do? What was his life?Faride Chavez Conway:	He worked for the mine, the silver mine. He was a blacksmith.Denise Chavez:	I didn't know that.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	What a handsome man.Faride Chavez Conway:	He was. He was very good looking.Denise Chavez:	I remember mother's story about -- She was very demure, for lack of a better word, and how she remembered that he always wanted her to wash his back and that she couldn't, even though they were married, right? They were married and he wanted her to wash his back?Faride Chavez Conway:	No.Denise Chavez:	Or what's the story?Faride Chavez Conway:	He wanted her to let him wash her back.Denise Chavez:	The wrong back.Faride Chavez Conway:	The wrong back, yeah. Because see, his mother, even though we were married, would still come out and scrub his back.Denise Chavez:	No! You've got to be kidding. She was in there scrubbing his back in the bathtub?Faride Chavez Conway:	Big [00:25:00] house is here. There was a garden area there, where she had fig trees and carnations, all kinds of pretty -- Remember those things?Denise Chavez:	Yes.Faride Chavez Conway:	Then the friend apartments was where they lived. You known that friend of yours?Denise Chavez:	Yes.Faride Chavez Conway:	I was born in her house, probably in that, um, the easternmost room there. That oil lamp that I have in the dining room at the house was the one that Mama Granda, because that's what we called Gumecinda, gave to me because she says this was burning the night you were born.Denise Chavez:	Oh my gosh. Well, and see that's one thing that I'd like to clarify. Your father, can you go through that movement? What happened to him? Why did he die? You were being born on one side of that building and he was dying in another. What's the story? What happened?Faride Chavez Conway:	Mother would never answer the question. When I ask her what he died of, she didn't know. Well, I talked to Mary Louise Chenoweth. Both she and he had pinworms and they went to Fort Davis to get better. I don't know if they're going to do surgery or what. He got sent home. and he told his mom that he had overheard the doctor tell the nurse, ''My God, you've just killed that man.'' Because supposedly she gave him the wrong kind of medication or whatever. So he came home, he got to see me right after I was born or shortly after I was born. Then he lasted two more days and I guess he just bloated up from the poison and he died but he was poisoned with some medication that he shouldn't have taken.Denise Chavez:	Oh, it's such a tragedy. I remember mother, she said, ''I could have sued but in those days, who sued?'' Well, how could she have sued? Mother would have never sued. That is a great tragedy. But this is what I want to say. I have been to that cemetery. Is he buried in El Bolivo or in Shafter?Faride Chavez Conway:	It was Shafter.Denise Chavez:	Okay. I have been to the Shafter Cemetery and stood around Tiburcio's  grave and I thanked him for passing because if he hadn't have left us, I would never be here.Faride Chavez Conway:	That's true.Denise Chavez:	I was very grateful.Faride Chavez Conway:	That empty spot there because it's the fence in, that was where mother was supposed to be buried. The Favers were very upset with me when she passed away that I didn't insist that we take her back to Shafter and bury her.Denise Chavez:	I never knew that. Did she want her buried there?Faride Chavez Conway:	No. In Shafter? Not really, because I really think she was more a Chavez than she was a Faver. Grandma Faver had never liked her because she wore fingernail polish and lipstick and she made my clothes. She had illusions of grandeur with reading and the place that they used to perform. That's where I got some of my theatrical bent.Denise Chavez:	I didn't know mother did that. I know that she was a poet, that she wrote some poetry, but she was in plays and did readings?Faride Chavez Conway:	No, well [inaudible 00:28:49] Savior and Marie Antonia did not allow their children to go out and mingle with the crowd or the -- Denise Chavez:	""La plebe.""Faride Chavez Conway:	La plebe.Denise Chavez:	Okay.Faride Chavez Conway:	What we call la plebe. So, on Sunday they would -- And [inaudible 00:29:07] , he subscribed to The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Washington paper, whatever it was at that time. They would read the paper and then they would have plays because they got bored. There was eight kids and they were bored. So they all had stage names, and mothers name was --Denise Chavez:	Oh, so they performed?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes, amongst each other and for family. And her name was Nacaris --Denise Chavez:	Nicanona? Nacacarisa? Was that it?Faride Chavez Conway:	Nicarisa La Cacarisa was her name. Then by the time it was over with she was just known as La Caca, which used to infuriate her (laughs), and I guess that's why they named her that to begin with.Denise Chavez:	Well, you know, it's good that they did that because when you grow up in a very [00:30:00] bound family -- I mean, Margot and I were always jumping around and doing little skits. Remember that? People would come over and we would do our little things, our little scenes and our little acts.Faride Chavez Conway:	That you wrote.Denise Chavez:	Yes. Well, no. Remember ""The Thirsty Fly?"" I used to do that, or ""The Fish in The Frying Pan"". Think about it, how silly they were but I have to do ""The Fish in The Frying Pan"" one of these days. But we just joked around and we're jumping around all the time.Faride Chavez Conway:	And you know that Uncle Beto was on Broadway?Denise Chavez:	Yes.Faride Chavez Conway:	He would have been an actor if it hadn't been for Pansy.Denise Chavez:	Oh gosh.Faride Chavez Conway:	He was really great because he was so handsome and he was such a good actor and stuff. She was insanely jealous of that. Pansy was so -- She made him miserable. He told me one time he said it wasn't worth it, he says, and I couldn't have ever divorced her. He says I believed in my faith too much, and they did. They had a really --Denise Chavez:	He could've been an actor. He was as handsome as Gilbert Roland, much handsomer than Anthony Quinn. He could have been a major Latino actor, couldn't he? Yes, he could have.Faride Chavez Conway:	He could have been an Italian actor and somebody wouldn't have known because he was white.Denise Chavez:	Yes. He spoke Italian, and later on he became an Italian teacher.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes. His skin was so white.Denise Chavez:	We come from a family of people of broken dreams. But at the same time, the dreams that they had were so wonderful that other dreams came up and it didn't matter if those other dreams were broken because look at mother's life. The death of Tiburcio Bucho Faver. But then she met E.E. Chavez. Then she's broken again, but then she goes forward. She became a very strong person. I think that, in a way, maybe those times of hardship and horror or whatever you want to say, those dark closets helped us to become really strong people.Faride Chavez Conway:	I believe that she was strong to begin with because Beto and Chita always used to say that she was just like Papa Chevo. And he being the father, I guess they used to butt heads.Denise Chavez:	Well, she looked like him, didn't she? Mother looked like her father.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes. A lot.Denise Chavez:	She had his chin.Faride Chavez Conway:	I guess the worst time that she had him scolding her, was where a young man had died and they had buried him in the white section of the cemetery. She was going around, getting the petition signed to make Kelly move him from that white part to the Mexican part.Denise Chavez:	Oh, she was an activist even then?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes. She's the one that desegregated the schools in Las Cruces, helped to desegregate [inaudible 00:33:18] and [inaudible 00:33:18]. She worked hard to get that done and finally got that done. That's reason her reaction to Joe surprised me so much.FEMALE_1:	So Kelly's your sister?Denise Chavez:	No. Kelly, it was the name of a funeral home in Marfa, Texas. Well -- But then again, that's not surprising because there is a lot of racism that people don't talk about. Mexicanos are antagonistic of blacks, blacks of of Mexicanos. There's a lot of it, inherent racism, but you know where that comes from? It comes from fear of the other. Remember, that they were another generation. I remember that mother took grandma Lupe Chavez to the drive-in, remember?Faride Chavez Conway:	To see Phil's [inaudible 00:34:08]Denise Chavez:	Sydney Poitier and my grandmother probably could've died in the drive-in because she goes, ""Ay, como -- How are they going to get married? He's black and she's white"" But either daddy -- E.E. Chavez was the same way, they were racist.Faride Chavez Conway:	She said though, ""Why doesn't somebody tell her he's black?"" That's what grandma Lupe said.Denise Chavez:	Oh my gosh. Because she probably couldn't see that well in the drive-in and then -- Maybe. I don't know. There was a problem there. It was a generational thing.Faride Chavez Conway:	But daddy accepted Joe a lot better than mother did. Mother wouldn't even let him help move her when she was dying until the very last day. She called him over and said --Denise Chavez:	That's good that it happened on the last day then.Faride Chavez Conway:	She [00:35:00] says, ""Joe, I want you go do it for me,"" and she gave him a check for $20. You could not read the check.Denise Chavez:	You do still have that check?Faride Chavez Conway:	No, it disintegrated.Denise Chavez:	Oh my gosh.Faride Chavez Conway:	But you couldn't read -- And remember her beautiful penmanship? She wanted him to go find her some watermelon, because you remember that's all she wanted to eat those last two weeks.Denise Chavez:	Mother loved watermelon, but then again, she was so weak when she died of cancer there; liver cancer. There was no way she could even chew it. I mean, if you're sick you have to go with the juice because it's so fibrous, she couldn't really deal with. So she gave him $20 to go find a watermelon?Faride Chavez Conway:	To find some watermelon.Denise Chavez:	But think about that, Faride. That's a very human action.Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, to me it helped.Denise Chavez:	Yes, it does.Faride Chavez Conway:	It didn't bother Joe because he had been treated that way all of his life. He knew what prejudice was, I mean, he grew up in Maryland and being black in Maryland is like being black in Georgia, or it was at that time, not anymore. In fact, when Joe and his first wife got married, they still had a lot.FEMALE_1:	For the records can you just say who Joe is?Faride Chavez Conway:	Joe is my husband.Denise Chavez:	We have to identify them. There are so many players in here. But Joe grew up in Maryland there.Faride Chavez Conway:	Right.Denise Chavez:	It was a very racist.Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, yeah. It was the South. The Mason-Dixon Line, it is up in Pennsylvania and between Pennsylvania and Maryland. So that didn't bother him. It just used to bother me and it would embarrass me. I didn't realize, but I've always been colorblind. One of the things that my children have always said to me is, ""Thanks mom for teaching us to look at the person, not the color or the religion or anything else.""Denise Chavez:	But you know, a lot of our people -- And I talk about our ancestors -- They grew up with such limitation and their worlds were so small that they had all those problems. I remember E.E Chavez, our dad, were so bigoted. And you know, I wouldn't -- He embarrassed me so many times. I would even monitor his TV watching when he got older and was living there next door to us. Because he was so awful sometimes. In a way, I thank him. You have to thank those people that even were negative because you don't want to be like that, you're not like that, you don't accept that, and you can see that. Thank God we're not like that.Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, it was when I moved to Las Cruces. That was the first time I'd ever heard of a Mexican-American or a Spanish-American. So I assumed then that mother and I must be Mexican-American and the Chavez's were Spanish-Americans because that's what they said they were.Denise Chavez:	Yes, they did.Faride Chavez Conway:	Not only that, but the fact that they had their fair and blonde and blue-eyed, like Uncle Eddie. Elias had green eyes. Grandpa Chavez had blue eyes. It was a lot.Denise Chavez:	Well, they did think they were Espanolas. Remember that a lot of the Chavez's in New Mexico are all related and they came from that little village up north called Los Chavez.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	I once asked daddy, as you know, the famous answer. I said, ""Dad, what are you?"" He says, ""I'm a Spanish white man."" I could not understand that because I've always felt that I was Mexican-American Chicana. Not everybody is a Chicana. Mother was never a Chicana.Faride Chavez Conway:	Oh, God. She hated that.Denise Chavez:	I know she hated the Brown Berets and Tony Luhan or -- Or Brown Beret. She didn't really like mariachi music, but she did like certain aspects of Mexicana music.Faride Chavez Conway:	Quite.Denise Chavez:	Oh, she did. She loved Agustin Lara.Faride Chavez Conway:	Oh. Okay. The ballads.Denise Chavez:	The classics, [inaudible 00:39:22] , all of those things. She loved the classics. But then again, she used to take us to [inaudible 00:39:28] and to all the movies. So she wasn't that antagonistic really. But I don't know. There's more to talk about. Did you feel the racism when you moved here when you were seven, here in Las Cruces and Mesilla? Faride Chavez Conway:	I didn't feel the racism until I went to Colorado to go to college. And I was --The doctor wanted to know what my name was and I said, ""Well, it's Arabic."" He says, ""Oh, are you Arabic?"" I said, ""No, I'm [00:40:00] a Mexican."" Because I was so proud of being a Mexican. He went, ""Oh, my God. Thank God, you don't look like one."" At the age of 17, I got stripped. I'm thinking, if I don't look like what I am, what I am I? Am I nothing? Am I invisible? What is it? It made me start looking. I remember in Fort Collins, Colorado when I first moved there, they had signs and some of the stores -- ""White trade only."" I thought it was for people like Joe, a black person. Turned out it was for people like me.Denise Chavez:	That's really sad.Faride Chavez Conway:	Then we went into a restaurant one time and it said ""No dogs or Mexicans are allowed,"" which to me a dog was worth more than a Mexican. I wasn't going to go in and Will turned me around and said you will go in and they didn't say anything.Denise Chavez:	Well, it's like the movie Giant, which was filmed, of course in Marfa, Texas with some of our relatives. I mean, that was true. There are many truthful aspects to them, for sure.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	Did you ever see Elizabeth Taylor? Was she beautiful?Faride Chavez Conway:	I'll tell you what, she was absolutely more beautiful than any photograph I've ever seen. She did not take good pictures because she was absolutely stunning.Denise Chavez:	Oh, that's great.Faride Chavez Conway:	She was tiny. You know, she give the illusion of being big, but she was this tiny, little petite woman with a tiny little waist and perfectly proportioned and that face, that complexion.Denise Chavez:	That face is beautiful. I think we need to come back because we've just scratched the very tip here. I think it's time now. But gosh, Faride, I really want you to keep working and writing and collecting the history of the Faver, Chavez, whoever we are. We're such an amalgamation of so many things. Please, write those down, the stories.Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, I think we are an embodiment of the word mestizo. We're a combination of so many different people.Denise Chavez:	Yes, indeed.Faride Chavez Conway:	So many different nationalities, so many people, so many different religions, so many different countries that are in there.Denise Chavez:	Yes, we didn't even get into our sefardita, our Sephardic Jewish, roots in Mexico that we don't know enough about. I always say that, and I wrote down -- I think I'm a sefardita. I'm a Jewish, Buddhist, Catholic performance writer with my roots in the West.Faride Chavez Conway:	Actually, it's German that you are.Denise Chavez:	I'm German, too?Faride Chavez Conway:	Well, the Sephardic, the Jewish.Denise Chavez:	Oh, I see, that's where they came from.Faride Chavez Conway:	The Jewish came from because they were kicked out of, out of Russia, wherever, and ended up in Spain. Then Spain got rid of them and they ended up in Germany. Then when they had an opportunity to come and colonize a new world, they took it.Denise Chavez:	Then they came to Mexico.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah.Denise Chavez:	Well, thank you. Thanks, Faride, it's been so wonderful. I could listen to you for hours because you've already clarified a lot of things that I didn't know. You think you know the history. If we would write the same story, you and Margot, other sister and I, they would all be the same story but different stories, right?Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes.Denise Chavez:	Yours would be probably one of the most authentic because you are the oldest sister.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yeah. I like being the oldest sister, because I don't have to be bossy if I don't want to.Denise Chavez:	Yeah, that's right.Faride Chavez Conway:	Yes.Denise Chavez:	The middle sister can be very bossy if she wants to.Faride Chavez Conway:	You are the oldest sister, too.Denise Chavez:	I know, but that is a troubled spot.Faride Chavez Conway:	Do you think so? With whom?Denise Chavez:	Well, because it's the second family, and there you go.Faride Chavez Conway:	We're done.FEMALE_1:	Is there anything else that you wanted to say?Denise Chavez:	I'll let you end.Faride Chavez Conway:	End?Denise Chavez:	Or let's begin.Faride Chavez Conway:	I don't think there's ever an end to anything. I have four kids and seven grand-kids, and they're mostly Polish. (laughs) Last name is Kalinowski. They're mostly white, [00:45:00] white, white, because there isn't too much Hispanic left them in any of them, and yet they call themselves Mexican.Denise Chavez:	Well.Faride Chavez Conway:	My girls, boys, too. They're proud to be a Mexican.Denise Chavez:	There's the mestizo right here, right there.Faride Chavez Conway:	Uh-huh. So.Denise Chavez:	Que viva, el mestizo.Faride Chavez Conway:	That's true. Very true.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
